HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOMELINESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0012)

I TRIED TO THINK HOW IT COULD BE	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0014)
BUT THE DUST DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOLROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0015)

STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT THEM WHICH HERON CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0017)
IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING OUT TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0018)

HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0027)
THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOUR OF SAINT FRANCIS XAVIOR WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0028)
ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0029)
BEWARE OF MAKING MISTAKE	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0030)
STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FADE WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING CLOUD	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0031)
HE IS CALLED AS WE KNOW THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIES	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0032)
GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS XAVIOUR	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0033)
THE RECTOR PAUSED AND THEN HOLDING HIS CLASPED HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0034)
HE HAD THAT FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0035)
A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS AVIOR	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0036)
IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUST INTO A TAWNY GLOW	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0037)
THEY COULD WAIT NO LONGER	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0000)
FOR A WHOLE HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0001)
HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE POOL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0002)
THE GENEROSITY	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0003)
PRIDE AND SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0004)
WHOSE FEET WERE AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0005)
THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFER HE HAD REFUSED	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0006)
SOON THE WHOLE STREET WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0007)
THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW AND RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0008)
ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK HATS AND HUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKNEY	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0009)
BROTHER MAC CARDLE BROTHER KEOF	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0010)
THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MAY BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0011)
IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0012)
IDLE AND EMBITTERING TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0013)
THE PHRASE OF THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN ACCORD	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0014)
WORDS WAS IN THEIR COLORS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0015)
THEY ARE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NOMADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0016)
THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEYS AND WOOD BEGIRT AND CITADELLED AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARSHALLED RACES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0017)
AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0018)
THE VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALLING	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0019)
HALLO STEPHANOS HERE COMES THE DAEDALUS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0020)
THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HEWN STONE OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSE PLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WET LUSTRE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0021)
HE STOOD IN DEFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BANTER WITH EASY WORDS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0022)
IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE WHICH MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0023)
STEPHANO STEADLAS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0024)
A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAZE RENT CITY	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0025)
YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUED SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITIAN HOLBEIN TURNER AND TINTORET IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0000)
THEY UNITE EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERRING TO THEM AS COLOURISTS SOMETIMES AS CHIAROSCURISTS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0001)
BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CUROSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0002)
MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE OF ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUE SIDE BY SIDE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0003)
SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR POTS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0004)
IT WAS THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPATIUS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0005)
THEN HE COMES TO BEAK OF IT	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0006)
THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK IS PUT FROM THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GREY DEFINE THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0007)
FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEIZING UPON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0008)
NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS ENCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS AND THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEY ARE GRADATED JUSTLY	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0009)
BUT IN THIS VIGNETTE COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPALS BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0010)
THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAT I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVORITE CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GREEN PAPER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0011)
IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORIST WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUES IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0012)
IT MUST HOWEVER BE ONE OR THE OTHER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0013)
I DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL IS AN EASY ONE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0014)
THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST AND FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0015)
THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY AND NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0016)
THAT HIS STYLE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0017)
IN ALL THE EARTHLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0018)
THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THIS IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0019)
BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0020)
IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND DELICACY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0021)
YOU MUST LOOK TO HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0022)
THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARROQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGING AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0023)
NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THAT CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0024)
YOU KNOW I HAD JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0025)
HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MISTS THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELLOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO AND THE PYTHON	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0026)
NOW THERE IS RAPHAEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0027)
WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNER'S GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST INTELLECT A NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0028)

EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHAUCER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS UPON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0034)
THEN IN CHAUCER'S DREAM	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0035)
IN ALL THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOUGH SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0036)
EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF HOLBEIN OR DUR	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0037)
BUT NOW HERE IS THE SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0038)
IT HAD NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALITY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0039)

SEE THAT YOUR LIVES BE OF NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED KITE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0043)
IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KITES FLY FALCONS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WARWULF AND THE GEAR EAGLE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0044)

IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT DREW FROM DOUGLAS NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING THE REPLY THAT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION	(121-127105-121-127105-0000)
NO ONE ELSE TOLD A STORY NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WHICH I SAW HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING	(121-127105-121-127105-0001)
CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF INSTEAD OF ME HE SAW WHAT HE SPOKE	(121-127105-121-127105-0002)
THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROAN AT THAT AND MUCH REPROACH AFTER WHICH IN HIS PREOCCUPIED WAY HE EXPLAINED	(121-127105-121-127105-0003)
THIS STORY'S WRITTEN	(121-127105-121-127105-0004)
I COULD WRITE TO MY MAN AND ENCLOSE THE KEY HE WOULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FINDS IT	(121-127105-121-127105-0005)
THE OTHERS RESENTED POSTPONEMENT AND IT WAS JUST HIS SCRUPLES THAT CHARMED ME	(121-127105-121-127105-0006)
TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT NO THANK GOD NO AND IS THE RECORD YOURS	(121-127105-121-127105-0007)
HE HANG FIRE AGAIN A WOMAN'S	(121-127105-121-127105-0008)
SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THIS TWENTY YEARS	(121-127105-121-127105-0009)
SHE SENT ME THE PICTURES IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED	(121-127105-121-127105-0010)
SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANYTHING WHATEVER	(121-127105-121-127105-0011)
WASN'T SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE	(121-127105-121-127105-0012)
YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME	(121-127105-121-127105-0013)
YOU ARE EQUAL	(121-127105-121-127105-0014)
HE QUITTED THE FIRE AND DROPPED BACK INTO A CHAIR	(121-127105-121-127105-0015)
PROBABLY NOT TILL THE SECOND	(121-127105-121-127105-0016)
IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYONE WILL STAY	(121-127105-121-127105-0017)
CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAS BEEN FIXED	(121-127105-121-127105-0018)
MISSUS GRIFFIN HOWEVER EXPRESSED THE NEED OF A LITTLE MORE LIGHT	(121-127105-121-127105-0019)

WON'T YOU SEE DOUGLAS	(121-127105-121-127105-0021)
WELL IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHO HE WAS	(121-127105-121-127105-0022)
LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MAKE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE	(121-127105-121-127105-0023)
POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE INTEREST HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH	(121-127105-121-127105-0024)
THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED US UP	(121-127105-121-127105-0025)
THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGAN	(121-127105-121-127105-0026)
HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME THE OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED	(121-127105-121-127105-0027)
THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIR TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME	(121-127105-121-127105-0028)
THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THAT YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY	(121-127105-121-127105-0029)
DON'T ANTICIPATE	(121-127105-121-127105-0030)
SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISIT OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS	(121-127105-121-127105-0031)
YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSIONS	(121-127105-121-127105-0032)
THAT WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT	(121-127105-121-127105-0033)
IT SOUNDED DULL BUT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MEAN CONDITION WHICH WAS	(121-127105-121-127105-0034)
SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHILE FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED	(121-127105-121-127105-0035)
AND WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED	(121-127105-121-127105-0036)
HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THAT SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0000)
GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THE SAME DISHONOURED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0001)
YET THESE WORDS AFFECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0002)
THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME ITS BEST	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0003)
THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0004)
HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PAUL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0005)
THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER ON THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0006)
HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING UPON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0007)
MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER AND STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0008)
AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOVEMENT	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0009)
IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLY PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0010)
BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERWHELMING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0011)
BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAD EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0012)
PERIL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0013)
PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO TAKE ACQUAINTANCE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0014)
IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NEVER SPEAK AGAIN	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0015)
HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THE FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0000)
ANOTHER AND MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0001)
AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0002)
THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A BRIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0003)
WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY WHICH SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0004)
IT WAS THAT SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0005)
THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTIONS AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0006)
BUT IN TRUTH PAUL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0007)
COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD ON THEM	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0008)
BUT PAUL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0009)
SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH THE TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0010)
IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0011)
THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICED WINDOWS AND WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0012)
LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANT A FREE BORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0013)
YEA HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEACH	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0014)
HE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0015)
WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIRER STATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0016)
ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANTS OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0017)
LITTLE PEARLE WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTISPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREASTPLATE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0018)
CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOK	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0019)
IN TRUTH HE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0020)
EARLE ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0021)
BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTES FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0022)
THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACK STONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BULL	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0023)
CYRIL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0024)
HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEE PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLE WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0000)
HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AND A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TWINKLED WHEN HE MOVED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0001)
INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER STOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0002)
FOR A LONG TIME THEY HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0003)
WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNC JIMMY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0004)
NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THE LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANYONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0005)
AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE ELLIKINS THE PATH DIVIDED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0006)
HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE HIM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0007)
ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP A MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0008)
THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF MISTER PIPT	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0009)
MAC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0010)
I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY OWN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0011)
WE HAVE COME FOR A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0012)
AND YOU MUST BE OJA THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0013)
OJO HAS NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0014)
WE'RE TRAVELLING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0015)
THE GENTLEMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0016)
AT ONE ENDS STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0017)
IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER AND AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0018)
YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOMBI THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIGANS TO THE NORTH OF HERE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0019)
THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON A GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0020)
I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART BUT THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0021)
I M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0022)
YOU SEE IVE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC NUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0023)
THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMEN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0024)
I THINK I MUST SHEW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGOLOTTE LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0025)
BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK TO COOK THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0026)
YET THAT TASK IS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0027)
A BEDQUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLOURS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0028)
SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED THE CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLOURS ARE SO MIXED UP	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0029)
WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS A GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLOURS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0030)
AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OZMA LIVES GREY IS THE POPULAR COLOUR	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0031)
I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0032)
OJO EXAMINED THAT CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0000)
MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME MATERIAL THROUGHOUT	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0001)
THE HAND OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0002)
THE HAIR WAS OF A BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0003)
GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON MEDAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT WAS SOFT AND PLIABLE	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0004)
NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BURNS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0005)
WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HIS WORK	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0006)
SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY OF EACH OF THESE BOTTLES	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0007)
I THINK THAT WILL DO HE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0008)
SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE THREE KETTLES FROM THE FIRE	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0009)

THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUTSTRIPS THE DEER	(1320-122617-1320-122617-0022)

WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE IN WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTIONS	(1320-122617-1320-122617-0026)
AS SOON AS THOSE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS	(1320-122617-1320-122617-0027)
MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY AND LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NETTLED AT SO DIRECT AN ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREAT STRAITS	(1320-122617-1320-122617-0028)

BRAVELY AND GENEROUSLY HAD HE BATTLED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS AND MORE WILL I DARE IN HIS SERVICE	(1320-122617-1320-122617-0031)
KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY INTO ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE	(1320-122617-1320-122617-0032)
IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE OUR SCALP AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND UPON IT UNCAS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT AS BECOMES TRUE WARRIORS AND TRUSTY FRIENDS	(1320-122617-1320-122617-0033)

THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN PINING FOR THE CONDITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTISE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT A CROSS OF BLOOD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN	(1320-122617-1320-122617-0035)
GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SCENT IS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED IN KEEPING ETERNITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS AND THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION	(1320-122617-1320-122617-0036)

UNCAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPT FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS	(1320-122617-1320-122617-0041)
I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVIDENCE TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0000)
I ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0001)
MY BROTHER'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0002)
WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN IMPOSSIBLE MAN	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0003)

THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOME HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0007)
THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM TOGETHER	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0008)
THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0009)
I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0010)
A BROKEN TIP OF LEATHER WAS LYING THERE ALSO	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0011)
NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOUGH OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE SAWDUST IN IT	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0012)
OF ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0013)
TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE SOLD UP	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0014)
DID ANY ONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE A PRINTER	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0015)
I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU WE LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0016)
AND SO IT SEEMS TO ME	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0017)
NO MISTER SOLMES AT YOUR DISPOSAL	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0018)
ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE OF EACH STORY	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0019)
HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0020)

I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS SAID HE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0022)
ONE CAN HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0023)
YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY THIS CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0024)
THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRE TABLE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0025)
AS A MATTER OF FACT I COULD NOT SAID SOLMES FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0026)
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LESS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0027)
THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE FIRST	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0028)
HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPER WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0029)
MISTER SOLMES WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF ADMIRATION	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0030)
HOLMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS N N AND A SPACE OF CLEAR WOODS AFTER THEM YOU SEE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0031)
WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE HERE ARE OTHERS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0032)
I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THAT POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0033)
AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR ANY EMERGENCY	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0034)
HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HOLLO WHAT IS THIS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0035)
HOLMES HELD IT OUT UPON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0036)
WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO THE BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0037)
I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THEY ARE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0038)
AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION YET	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0039)
ONE ALWAYS LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0040)
LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS AND I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0041)
MY SCHOLAR HAD BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0042)
THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MYLES MC CL LAREN	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0043)
I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT AND OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0044)
HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THAT SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0045)
BUT I HAVE DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0046)
DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THAT TABLE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0047)
HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE A KEY IN THE DOOR	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0048)

AND ONE MORE MORNING	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0022)
IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THAT VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0023)
HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0024)
YOU KNOW IT I THINK SO	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0025)
THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARTIAL	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0026)
NO SIR SURELY NOT	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0027)
HERE WAS NO MAN SIR	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0028)
HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANNIER IN THE FARTHER CORNER	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0029)
JUST CLOSE THE DOORS SAID HOLMES	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0030)

THE ENGINE I ALSO THOUGHT NOTHING OF	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0036)
WHEN I APPROACHED OUR ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0037)
NO LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0038)

HE PUT HIS SHOES ON TABLE	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0043)
GLOVES SAID THE OLD MAN	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0044)
SUDDENLY HE HEARD AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0045)

I HAVE A LETTER HERE MISTER SOLMES WHICH I WROTE TO YOU EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RESTLESS NIGHT	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0047)
IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN A ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0048)
IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0049)
IF MISSUS SOLMES SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0050)
IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIORS SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0000)
THE NORTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLEANS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0001)
JOHN TAYLOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN CATTLE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0002)
BETTER GO HE CAUTIONED SENTENTIOUSLY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0003)
I MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL DOWN THERE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0004)
BUT NOW THERE'S NO SOCIETY JUST ELEMENTARY WORK	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0005)

SOME OTHERS FROM BIG COTTON COUNTY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0008)
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES ILL SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0009)
AT ANY RATE I SAY COME	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0010)
HERE SHE WAS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODORS AND POSSIBLY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0011)
SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALKS OF GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0012)
SO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TO DAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE GARDENS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0013)
CURTAIN SHE PAUSED	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0014)
SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TOUCH OF SIGHT	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0015)
THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DEAD LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0016)
THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE HAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0017)
HER COLOR SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0018)
COTTON IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BROTHERS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0019)
MISTER TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARK SEEMED CALLED FOR	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0020)
DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LIT'ALLY BORN IN COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0021)
I SPOSE THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0022)
GOOBLES DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS O VINES BUT ON DE GROUND ON DE ROOTS LIKE YAMS IS THAT SO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0023)
THE GOLD FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HEARKENED	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0024)
SOME DAY YOU'LL TELL ME PLEASE WON'T YOU	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0025)
NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION EXCEPT THINGS ONE THING COTTON	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0026)
THE HONORABLE CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0000)
AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0001)
WHY COULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0002)
SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE OF OTHERS	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0003)
AS SHE AWAITED HER GUEST SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TONIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CRITON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CRITON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0004)
MISSUS GRAY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THE CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0005)
HE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0006)
DO YOU BELIEVE IN SUCH EDUCATION ASKED MARY TAYLOR	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0007)
I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF THE PEOPLE TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0008)
BUT CRESWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN PRICES	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0009)
THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMEN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GREY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0010)
POSITIVELY HEROIC ADDED CRASWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0011)
BUT YOU'RE NOT ER EXACTLY WELCOME	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0012)
MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZORA TO MISSUS GREEN'S PRIVATE EAR LATER	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0013)
UNFORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0014)
HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS AND ZORES MUST BE RUINED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0000)
IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COFFIN ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0001)
OH THE SWAMP THE CRUEL SWAMP	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0002)
THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM A BURNING WONDER	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0003)
HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT NOR CARED AND KNEW NOT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0004)
SHE WAS SO STRANGE AND HUMANE A CREATURE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0005)
THE WORLD WAS A WATER VEILED IN MISTS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0006)
THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MID DAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STREAMED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0007)
THERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0008)
THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH DIKES A WEEK AGO AND NOW	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0009)
PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE HERE WAITING WEEPING	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0010)
HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED OFF SADLY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0011)
HE SPLASHED AND STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT ON THE TREE BRIDGE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0012)
THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THAT LAGOON WAS DRY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0013)
HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOW	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0014)
THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST THE BOWLS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0015)
FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT AND LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST THE TREE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0016)
HE GAZED ABOUT PERPLEXED AND ASTONISHED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0017)
HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAINS SOME ONE HAD DUG A CANAL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0018)
HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST THERE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0019)
THE DAYS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0020)
THE HOPE OR DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0021)
UP IN THE SICK ROOM ZORA LAY UPON THE LITTLE WHITE BED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0022)
THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING AND STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0023)
FOR WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AT SUN AND BIRD AND TREE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0024)
SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED HER SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0025)
SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDER HE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MET HER LOVE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0026)
ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LO THE CANNON LAY BEFORE HER	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0027)
THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY AND HE KNEW	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0028)
HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREE AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0029)
IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOOR PLACES	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0000)
BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE A GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0001)
FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0002)
A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY HORN BAGS	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0003)
AND WHEN THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0004)
SEVERAL CLOTHES A PILLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLORED RAGS	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0005)
ON THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0006)
THE HISTORY OF THAT HOUSE IS PLAIN NOW	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0007)
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS IN THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0008)
FOR THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY THE WHITTAW OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TRADDLESTON GOSSIP	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0009)
HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0010)
DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHT FOOTED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0011)
THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR ARTHUR AND MARY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0012)
HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EAR SHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAS LEFT OFF	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0013)
THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WHITAWS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0014)
TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GONE THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0015)
SINNING INDEED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0016)

NO NO NO TOTTY'LL GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0028)
DID EVER ANYONE SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0029)
TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARD THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKING PIG	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0030)
AND HE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO AUNT RACHEL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0031)
I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK TO YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0032)
WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I HAVE FOUND IT SO	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0033)
AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS OF SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING AN TOWLING AS ISN'T MADE UP	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0034)

I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THAT VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0038)
I'VE STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANY THING I'VE DONE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0039)

DIRECTION A	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0041)

BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSE IT WAS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO COME IN	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0043)
SAID MISSUS IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0044)
AH SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0045)
I DELIGHT IN MY KITCHEN	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0046)
POYSER IS NOT AT HOME HAS HE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0047)
SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG A SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0048)
NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSITUR TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR OF THE WOOL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0049)
BUT THERE'S FATHER IN THE BARN SIR IF HE'LL BE OF ANY USE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0050)
NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WHELPS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0051)
I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANTED TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0052)
FOR IF HE'S ANY WHERE ON THE FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0053)
OH SIR SAYS MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0054)
BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0055)
THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0056)
I KNOW ITS FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0057)
BY THE BYE I NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY MISSUS POYSER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0058)
THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINIONS OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0059)
AH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0060)
THE PARIS PLANT LIKE THAT IN THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0000)
THE LONDON PLAN WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0001)
THERE MESSRS JOHNSON AND HAMMOND PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0002)
THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVEN YEARS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0003)
OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON SLOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0004)
WHY IF WE ERECT A STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP INTO THE CITY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0005)
THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WOULD CHANGE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0006)
BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THAT GATE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0007)
EVERY THING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONSTRUCTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0008)
FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS IN ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0009)
IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH WERE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0010)
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARMHOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT OF ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0011)
EDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM AND COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALVANOMETER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0012)
UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0013)
MISTER EDISON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF TIME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0014)
HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITING FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0015)
THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0016)
EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIGHT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE THREE KIND	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0017)
HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPEN BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0018)
THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0019)
IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LENGTHS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0020)
THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD PULL LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0021)
MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH MISTER JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0022)
I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE MEDICINE CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0023)
BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN HIS COUNTRY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0024)
THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF EDISONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0025)
THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNT SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0026)
EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METTER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0027)
THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANY THING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0028)
THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0029)
THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC MATTER IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0030)
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENUOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0031)
THE STANDARD MEDICINE METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0032)
IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METRE THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0033)
THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN OPPOSITION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BASIS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0034)
IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METRE WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN THE STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METRE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0035)
THE METRE CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0036)
HE WEIGHED AND RE WEIGHED THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATIONS IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0037)
HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BEST	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0038)
A PROBLEM WAS SOLVED	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0039)
THEY WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0040)
WE HAD MET IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0041)
HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE BILLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME	(237-126133-237-126133-0000)
EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WAS FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS	(237-126133-237-126133-0001)
THEN SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS	(237-126133-237-126133-0002)
SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS TIME IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER	(237-126133-237-126133-0003)
IF I COULD ONLY SEE PHRONSIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT	(237-126133-237-126133-0004)

ASKED PHRONSIE HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE TO POLLY'S OWN	(237-126133-237-126133-0008)

ASKED PHRONSIE WITH INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE	(237-126133-237-126133-0014)
YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHTER HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE	(237-126133-237-126133-0015)
OH NO JAPS I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF	(237-126133-237-126133-0016)
THERE HAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE	(237-126133-237-126133-0017)

DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER THERE TOO	(237-126133-237-126133-0019)
HOW DID HER MOTHER NEVER LET HER GO	(237-126133-237-126133-0020)
SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE YOUR FATHER	(237-126133-237-126133-0021)
I DON'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY	(237-126133-237-126133-0022)
HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PAPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY	(237-126133-237-126133-0023)
AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HEAVY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME	(237-126133-237-126133-0024)
AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF IT AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY	(237-126133-237-126133-0025)

HAUNT STIRS NOT	(260-123288-260-123288-0014)
FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL EMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THE COMPONENT MOLECULES THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM	(260-123288-260-123288-0015)

HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOMED LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS	(260-123440-260-123440-0010)

I AM VERY TIRED OF BEING ALL ALONE HERE	(260-123440-260-123440-0013)
AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD THAT IS	(260-123440-260-123440-0014)
I WISH I HAD N'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT	(260-123440-260-123440-0015)
I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN EARS	(260-123440-260-123440-0016)
THAT WILL BE A CLEAR THING TO BE SURE	(260-123440-260-123440-0017)

CRIED ALICE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED	(260-123440-260-123440-0019)
WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE AGREED	(260-123440-260-123440-0020)
WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL DO IT	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0000)
THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLIN HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0001)
LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON GOLDATIONS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0002)
THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECOMING OPPRESSIVE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0003)
IT WAS WRITTEN IN A LATIN	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0004)
THE WORDS HAD TO BE CONDENSED	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0005)
A WORD SHOULD NOT BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ONGULATIONS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0006)
MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTOR MY GALATIONS FOR INSTANCE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0007)
IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIONS AND ROER PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0008)
IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERIT ALONE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0009)
BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0010)
THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0011)
THE WORD OF GOD SHALL STAND FOR EVER	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0012)
IN EVERY WAY I SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0000)
THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0001)
HE WAS THE FIRST TO TURN TO CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0002)
PAUL CAME LATER THAN IS BENEATH US	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0003)
AND INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0004)
DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF THE FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0005)
AGAINST THESE BOASTED FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY AND MINISTRY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0006)
AS THE AMBASSADOR OF GOVERNMENT IS HONOURED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0007)
GOD TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0008)
THOU AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0009)
EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0010)
PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES ARE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0011)
THE MOST THEY WOULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0012)
IT MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0013)
A CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0014)
A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0015)
HE SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0016)
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CULL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0017)
I DO NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0018)
I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINES OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0019)
THIS IS NOT SINFUL PRIDE IT IS HOLY PRIDE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0020)
AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED ME FROM THE DEAD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0021)
THE CLUE SEEMED SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0022)
THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF BOTH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0023)
IN THIS LITTLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0024)
BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LOT SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0025)
FIRST TOO	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0026)
AND ALL THE BRETHREN WHICH WERE WITH ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0027)
THIS SHALL GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0028)
ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY WERE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS I DO	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0029)
THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0030)
WHY DO WE NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0031)
WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEVER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0032)
NOT ALL THE GALATIONS HAD BEEN PERVERTED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0033)
THIS MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0034)
THEY REMAINED DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINIONS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0035)
WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNS THERE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0036)
SO MUCH FOR THE STYLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0037)
GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0038)
THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOT PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0039)
THIS GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS REFRESHING	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0040)
GRACE INVOLVES REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0041)
THE WORLD BRANDS THIS THE PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0042)
EXPERIENCE PRODUCES THIS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0043)
PERHAPS THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0044)
THEY SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0045)
WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SEE FROM GOD THE FATHER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0046)
TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE OR TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0047)
HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONGST MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0048)
EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATION OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0049)
DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0050)
WHILE YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0051)
WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS A DIVINE TEACHER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0052)
AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS A VERY GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0053)
THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND EASE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0054)
TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS NOT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0055)
OTHERWISE PAUL COULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0056)
THE ARABIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0057)
MAHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0058)
PAUL STICKS TO THE THEME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0059)
HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0060)
NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASIA LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0061)
NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GREATNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0062)
UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY WERE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0063)
HOW MIGHT WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0064)
PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GIVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0065)
SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN TO OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0066)
THAT SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0067)
THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES HIS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0068)
THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN WAS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0069)
AND WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0070)
WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR EFFORT WE CAN DISMISS SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0071)
THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE CALLED UNDER SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0072)
THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0073)
THIS ATTRIBUTE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0074)
BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON HIM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0075)
ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO DREADFUL THAT WE MUST DESPAIR	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0076)
HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DESTROY SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE	(2961-960-2961-960-0000)
THE INFLUENCE WHICH THAT TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING	(2961-960-2961-960-0001)
IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEO PLATONISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS IN CONNECTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO	(2961-960-2961-960-0002)
THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL	(2961-960-2961-960-0003)
THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEOP LATINISTS	(2961-960-2961-960-0004)
IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY A CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT	(2961-960-2961-960-0005)
THE FANCIES OF THE NEOP PLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY	(2961-960-2961-960-0006)
BUT THESE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM	(2961-960-2961-960-0007)
WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAD EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND	(2961-960-2961-960-0008)
THIS DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS	(2961-960-2961-960-0009)
BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED HIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL	(2961-960-2961-960-0010)
WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE ANXAGORRUS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER	(2961-960-2961-960-0011)
MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PYSOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS	(2961-960-2961-960-0012)
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD IS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE	(2961-960-2961-960-0013)
THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN AND THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES	(2961-960-2961-960-0014)
THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGS	(2961-960-2961-960-0015)
BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENTS WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PHEDRES OR SYMPOSIUM	(2961-960-2961-960-0016)
NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER	(2961-960-2961-960-0017)
BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS NEARLY GIVEN UP	(2961-960-2961-960-0018)
HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAVE NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA	(2961-960-2961-960-0019)
AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POET OF LUCRETIUS	(2961-960-2961-960-0020)
THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLY WRITINGS	(2961-960-2961-960-0021)
PLATO HAD NOT A COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART	(2961-960-2961-960-0022)
SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEUS A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC	(2961-961-2961-961-0000)
AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE	(2961-961-2961-961-0001)
AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIAS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO WAS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE	(2961-961-2961-961-0002)
I WILL IF TIMOEUS APPROVES I APPROVE	(2961-961-2961-961-0003)
LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SOLUS WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF TROPIDUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME	(2961-961-2961-961-0004)
SOME POEMS OF HELEN WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS	(2961-961-2961-961-0005)
AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEMS SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK	(2961-961-2961-961-0006)
THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE ENGAGED	(2961-961-2961-961-0007)
BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF ACTORS	(2961-961-2961-961-0008)
TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SELLEN HEARD THIS STORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0009)
BUT IN EGYPT THE TREASURES OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES	(2961-961-2961-961-0010)
THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNALS SALEN ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0011)
IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN	(2961-961-2961-961-0012)
SELLEN MARVELED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS	(2961-961-2961-961-0013)
NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND SIX THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED OURS AS OUR ANNALS RECORD	(2961-961-2961-961-0014)
MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE A COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME	(2961-961-2961-961-0015)
I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THE ACCOUNTS OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS	(2961-961-2961-961-0016)
OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE THE LORD TOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN	(2961-961-2961-961-0017)
THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLANDS OF ATLANTIS	(2961-961-2961-961-0018)
BUT AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE OTHER HELLENES HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS	(2961-961-2961-961-0019)
THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE OCEAN	(2961-961-2961-961-0020)
BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THIS TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0021)
AND NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORDS SPOKE	(2961-961-2961-961-0022)
BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE LATE SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0000)
THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN ELEMENT OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0001)
SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULNESS OF LIFE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0002)
WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS TABOO MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABOOS OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0003)
IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEISURED CLASS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0004)
ON THE TABOO CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0005)
DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK OF THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0006)
IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERY OTHER SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0007)
THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF A MASTER	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0008)
WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FOUND TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0009)
THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE UPON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0010)
THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DID NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0011)
THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK AND GRADE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0012)
THIS DIFFERENTIATION WAS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0013)
MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0014)
SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE MATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0015)
MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSON A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMERS IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0016)
THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE THE MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0017)
THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OF THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0018)
BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT UPON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0019)
SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARM AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0020)
WHEN AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONORIFIC CHARACTER	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0021)
A LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0022)
IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO VIEWS COINCIDE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0000)
THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OF THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0001)
BUT AS WE ASCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0002)
IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONGST THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0003)
IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES THROUGH THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0004)
THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MEN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0005)
SO MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0006)
THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATIONS OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0007)
THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSON WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0008)
EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIEST STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0009)
THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THIS SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0010)
IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH MEASURE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0011)
IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF A COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0012)
CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT AND THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0013)
AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEIGHBOURHOOD GOSSIPS SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0014)
THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0015)
UNDER THIS SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0000)
BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE CORSEY PEACEABLE CULTURE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0001)
OTHERS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0002)

SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES IN MISSOURI INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THE CENTRE BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISSOURIANS	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0011)

A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON FAMILIES ON SHOAL CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN FELL UPON THE HAPLESS SETTLERS AND BUTCHERED A SCORE	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0015)
BE IT SAID TO THE HONOUR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS INTRUSTED WITH A TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNT ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGN THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0016)
AH WHAT A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0017)
AMERICAN SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE VARIOUS ALBAGINZES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH THE PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE VAUDOIS HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0018)

BUT A WORD CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL	(4077-13754-4077-13754-0001)
IT WAS THROUGH FLOYD'S ADVICE THAT BUCHANAN ORDERED THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH OSTENSIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN ALLEGED INFANTILE REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD NOW COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THE SECESSIONISTS	(4077-13754-4077-13754-0002)

A NORTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF WHY NOT SET UP ALSO A WEST	(4077-13754-4077-13754-0004)

IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE AND I HAVE YET TO FIND THAT PLACE AND MEET THE PEOPLE WHERE AND WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE MALIGNED MORMONS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST	(4077-13754-4077-13754-0008)

BEFORE THIS TRAVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THERE MET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT DESERVED MEN WERE IMPRISONED UNDER SENTENCE OF MANY YEARS DURATION	(4077-13754-4077-13754-0013)
THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING AND CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE	(4077-13754-4077-13754-0014)
THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND INITIATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL ESTATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVERS AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY	(4077-13754-4077-13754-0015)

ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARREN OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0018)
NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN IN DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE NORTH	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0019)

SHE SAW THAT THE BED WAS GILDED AND SO RICH THAT IT SEEMED THAT OF A PRINCE RATHER THAN A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0013)
AMONG OTHER THINGS ON WHICH SHE CAST HER EYES WAS A SMALL CRUCIFIX OF SOLID SILVER STANDING ON A CABINET NEAR THE WINDOWS	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0014)

THE BED SHE SO WELL REMEMBERED WAS THERE AND ABOVE ALL THE CABINET ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAGE SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS STILL ON THE SAME SPOT	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0025)
LOUIS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT IN A MONTH HE AROSE FROM HIS BED AND DURING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THEIR OWN CHILD	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0026)
THUS SAYING AND PRESSING THE CRUCIFIX TO HER BREAST SHE FELL FAINTING INTO THE ARMS OF DONA ESTAHANIA WHO WAS A GENTLEWOMAN TO WHOSE SEX PITY IS AS NATURAL AS CRUELTY AS TO A MAN INSTANTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO THOSE OF THE FAINTING GIRL SHEDDING OVER HER SO MANY TEARS THAT THERE NEEDED NO OTHER SPRINKLING OF WATER TO RECOVER LEOCADIA FROM HER SWOON	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0027)

THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAD LEARNED FROM HER LIPS IS CONFIRMED BY HIS FACE IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH BEHELD THAT OF OUR SON	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0029)
JUST THEN LEOCADIA CAME TO HERSELF AND EMBRACING THE CROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO A SEA OF TEARS AND THE GENTLEMAN REMAINING IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END LEOCADIA'S WHOLE STORY HE BELIEVED IT THROUGH THE BLESSED DISPENSATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONFIRMED IT BY SO MANY CONVINCING TESTIMONIES	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0030)
SO PERSUASIVE WERE HER ENTREATIES AND SO STRONG HER ASSURANCES THAT NO HARM WHATEVER COULD RESULT TO THEM FROM THE INFORMATION SHE SOUGHT THEY WERE INDUCED TO CONFESS THAT ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MENTIONED THEMSELVES AND ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON A STROLL WITH RODOLPHO THEY HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN THE ABDUCTION OF A GIRL WHOM RODOLPHO CARRIED OFF WHILST THE REST OF THEM DETAINED HER FAMILY WHO MADE A GREAT OUTCRY AND WOULD HAVE DEFENDED HER IF THEY COULD	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0031)
FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LADY MOTHER GIVE ME A WIFE WHO WOULD BE AN AGREEABLE COMPANION NOT ONE WHO WOULD DISGUST ME SO THAT WE MAY BOTH BEAR EVENLY AND WITH MUTUAL GOOD WILL THE YOKE IMPOSED ON US BY HEAVEN INSTEAD OF PULLING THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AND FRETTING EACH OTHER TO DEATH	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0032)

SHE REFLECTED HOW NEAR SHE STOOD TO THE CRISIS WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED OR UNHAPPY FOREVER AND RACKED BY THE INTENSITY OF HER EMOTIONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOUR HER HEAD DROPPED AND SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SWOON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DISMAYED ASTAHANIA	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0035)
HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DESTINED PROTECTOR BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS INSENSIBLE SHE WAS NEARLY MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD HE NOT COME TO HIMSELF	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0036)

WHEN SHE CAME TO HER SENSES AND BLUSHING TO FIND HERSELF IN RODOLPHO'S ARMS WOULD HAVE DISENGAGED HERSELF NO SENORA HE SAID THAT MUST NOT BE STRIVE NOT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE ARMS OF HIM WHO HOLDS YOU IN HIS POWER	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0039)

NOR WAS RODOLPHO LESS SURPRISED THAN THEY AND THE BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF SO WONDERFUL A FACT HE BEGGED LOCADIA TO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENTICATED BY HIS PARENTS	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0041)
YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LEK	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0000)
SAID LORD CHERFORD ADDRESSING ME	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0001)

THEY WERE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL COUSINS	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0003)
WHATEVER LORD CHELFORD SAID MISTER BRANDON RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0004)
BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN LEAK WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0005)
AT DINNER LAKE WAS EAGER AND AMUSING	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0006)
I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WYLDER CHUCKLING BENIGNANTLY UPON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0007)
I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THE WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0008)
AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THAT LITTLE PARALLELOGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLY AMUSEMENT	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0009)
I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING IN	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0010)
WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING AT THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0011)
AND WYLDER LAUGHED TOO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOUR OF THE JOKE SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES ON LEEK BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DOROTHY ONLY REMARKING	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0012)
DO YOU KNOW LAKE O I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0013)
HE'S NOT THE MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0014)
I HAD A HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT AND	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0015)
AH I KNOW THAT'S LORN BRANDON	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0016)
ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LEASH	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0017)
MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TO	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0000)
AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL MORE COMPLIMENTARY	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0001)
BUT DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISH	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0002)
IN THE MEANTIME I HAVE FORMED A NEW IDEA OF HER	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0003)
BY THE TIME LORD CHELFORD AND WYLDER RETURNED AND DISGUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANT OF GENERALSHIP	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0004)
AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CANE TOWARDS BRANDON HALL OVER HIS SHOULDERS	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0005)
YES SO THEY SAID BUT IT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORSE	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0006)

THE WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHEL AT LAST SAID	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0011)
NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE RADIE FOR I DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0012)
THERE WAS THE BRIGHT MOONLIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOUGHS AND WITHERED LEAVES AND THE MOTTLED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED ODDLY ACROSS HIS PALE FEATURES	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0013)

I AM VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN'T HELP IT	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0017)
TO MY MIND THERE IS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FEUDS	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0018)
THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVE THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTHED MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEWHAT IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND ESPECIAL SATANIC ACTION	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0019)
THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOF	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0020)
MY BEDROOM WAS UNEXCEPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0021)

THEY MOVED THEREAFTER CAUTIOUSLY ABOUT THE HUT GROPING BEFORE AND AROUND THEM TO FIND SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT WARRENTON HAD FULFILLED HIS MISSION	(61-70970-61-70970-0024)

FITZOOTH'S HEAD RESTED AT LAST UPON THE TOP RUNG OF A LADDER AND SLOWLY THE TRUTH CAME TO HIM	(61-70970-61-70970-0026)

NAY NAY LORDY ANSWERED WARRENTON WITH A HALF LAUGH	(61-70970-61-70970-0034)
WARRENTON SPOKE THUS WITH SIGNIFICANCE TO SHOW ROBIN THAT HE WAS NOT TO THINK JEFFREY'S CLAIMS TO THE STATE WOULD BE PASSED BY	(61-70970-61-70970-0035)
ROBIN FITZOOTH SAW THAT HIS DOUBTS OF WARRENTON HAD BEEN UNFAIR HE BECAME ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR HARBOURING THEM	(61-70970-61-70970-0036)
HIS TONES RANG PLEASANTLY AT WARRENTON'S EARS AND FORTHWITH A GOOD FELLOWSHIP WAS HERALDED BETWEEN THEM	(61-70970-61-70970-0037)
THE OLD SERVANT TOLD HIM QUIETLY AS THEY CREPT BACK TO GAMEWELL THAT THIS PASSAGE WAY LED FROM THE HUT IN THE PLEASAUNCE TO SHERWOOD AND THAT JEFFREY FOR THE TIME WAS HIDING WITH THE OUTLAWS IN THE FOREST	(61-70970-61-70970-0038)

THEY REGAINED THEIR APARTMENT APPARENTLY WITHOUT DISTURBING THE HOUSEHOLD OF GREENWELL	(61-70970-61-70970-0040)
OUT OF THE WOOD STOOD A NICE LITTLE FIR TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0000)
THE PLACE HE SAID WAS A VERY GOOD ONE THE SUN SHONE ON HIM AS TO FRESH AIR THERE WAS ENOUGH OF THAT AND ROUND HIM GREW MANY LARGE SIZED COMRADES PINES AS WELL AS FIRS	(672-122797-672-122797-0001)
HE DID NOT THINK OF THE WARM SUNSHINE AND OF THE FRESH AIR HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE LITTLE COTTAGE CHILDREN THAT RAN ABOUT AND PRATTLED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WOODS LOOKING FOR WILD STRAWBERRIES	(672-122797-672-122797-0002)
BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE	(672-122797-672-122797-0003)
IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY GLITTERING ON THE GROUND A HARE WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING ALONG AND JUMP RIGHT OVER THAT LITTLE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0004)
ALL THAT MADE HIM SO ANGRY	(672-122797-672-122797-0005)
TO GROW AND GROW TO GET OLDER AND BE TALL THOUGHT A TREE THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL THING IN THE WORLD	(672-122797-672-122797-0006)
IN AUTUMN THE WOODCUTTER ALWAYS CAME AND FELLED SOME OF THE LARGEST TREES	(672-122797-672-122797-0007)
THIS HAPPENED EVERY YEAR AND THE YOUNG FIR TREE THAT HAD NOW GROWN TO A VERY COMELY SIZE TREMBLED AT THE SIGHT FOR THE MAGNIFICENT GREAT TREES FELL TO THE EARTH WITH NOISE AND CRACKING THE BRANCHES WERE LOPPED OFF BUT THE TREES LOOKED LONG AND BARE THEY WERE HARDLY TO BE RECOGNIZED AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARTS AND THE HORSES DRAGGED THEM OUT OF THE WOOD	(672-122797-672-122797-0008)
HAVE YOU NOT MET THEM EVERYWHERE	(672-122797-672-122797-0009)
REJOICE IN THY GROWTH SAYS THE SUNBEAMS	(672-122797-672-122797-0010)
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS NOW	(672-122797-672-122797-0011)
I WOULD FAIN KNOW THAT I AM DESTINED FOR SO GLORIOUS A CAREER CRIED THE TREE REJOICING	(672-122797-672-122797-0012)
I AM NOW TALL AND MY BRANCHES SPREAD LIKE THE OTHERS THAT WERE CARRIED OFF LAST YEAR AH	(672-122797-672-122797-0013)
WERE I BUT ON THE CART	(672-122797-672-122797-0014)
WERE I IN THE WARM ROOM WITH ALL THEIR SPLENDOR AND MAGNIFICENCE	(672-122797-672-122797-0015)
YET THEN SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDER WILL SURELY FOLLOW OR WHEREFORE SHOULD THEY THUS ORNAMENT ME	(672-122797-672-122797-0016)
SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDER MIGHT FOLLOW BUT WHAT	(672-122797-672-122797-0017)
REJOICE IN OUR PRESENCE SAID THE AIR AND THE MOONLIGHT	(672-122797-672-122797-0018)
REJOICE IN THY OWN FRESH BEAUTY	(672-122797-672-122797-0019)
BUT THE TREE DID NOT REJOICE AT ALL IT GREW AND GREW AND WAS GREEN BOTH WINTER AND SUMMER	(672-122797-672-122797-0020)
AND TOWARDS CHRISTMAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS SET DOWN	(672-122797-672-122797-0021)
THE AXE STRUCK DEEP INTO THE VERY PITH THE TREES FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANG IT WAS LIKE A SWOON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPRUNG UP	(672-122797-672-122797-0022)
HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANY MORE NOT EVEN THE BIRDS	(672-122797-672-122797-0023)
A DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE	(672-122797-672-122797-0024)

WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS SAID THE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0043)
THEN HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIE	(672-122797-672-122797-0044)

NO THAT TOO IS OVER	(672-122797-672-122797-0065)
WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK ON THE LOFT	(672-122797-672-122797-0066)
THE TRUNKS WERE REMOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE	(672-122797-672-122797-0067)
BUT IT WAS NOT THE FIR TREE THAT HE MEANT	(672-122797-672-122797-0068)
IT WAS IN A GARDEN THAT HE LAY AMONG WEEDS AND NETTLES	(672-122797-672-122797-0069)
A GOLDEN STAR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE	(672-122797-672-122797-0070)
IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MARRIED CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM	(672-122797-672-122797-0071)
AND A GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE	(672-122797-672-122797-0072)
THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BREWING COPPER AND HE SIGHED SO DEEPLY	(672-122797-672-122797-0073)
HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE CALLED THE STORY AT AN END	(672-122797-672-122797-0074)

I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE LAWYER	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0002)
IT IS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0003)
BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE A MERE BLUFF	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0004)
HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DID NOT STOP TO COUNT THE COST	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0005)
IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGED CHECK THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0006)

I WAS BIT KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHEQUE AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0030)
AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED THEM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0031)
I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE WHICH WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARSHALL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0032)
IT WAS BETTER FOR THEM TO THINK THE GIRL UNFEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0033)
I M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0034)

BETH UNEASY AT ITS SILENCE NUDGED HIM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0050)
WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SHREWD FACE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0051)
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE HAD BEEN SHARP	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0052)
AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0053)

THAT DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0003)
UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS REYNOLDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE REFUSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPKINS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0004)

HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MATE'S HAND	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0031)
HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORM MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0032)
SHE ROSE QUIETLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH HER BREATH	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0033)

UPON A LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGSTONES	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0019)
BRAGELONNE WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVIL SLUMBERS OF MANIKEMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0020)

BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT DOWN A CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACED HER COMPANION	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0004)
THE TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICTURES TO THE WALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0005)

WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHIA SPRAGUE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0007)
I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMPED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE BUT IT S BEEN OF SOME USE AFTER ALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0008)
DO YOU SUPPOSE A MINIATURE WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0009)

CAN'T HURT ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0013)
THIS THOUGHT DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PAIR	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0014)
SMUGGLING A HOUSE CLEANING PARAPHERNALIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUST PAN TO THE OUTFIT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0015)
THE LURE PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A KITTEN MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0016)
OH LET HIM COME ON SHE URGED I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0017)
THAT MAKES IT SORT OF COSIER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0018)
THEN LET'S DUST THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0019)
YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0020)
SURFACE DUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE THE HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0021)
THEN SHE SUDDENLY MURMURED	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0022)
AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND WE HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0023)
THEY SAY ILLUMINATIONS BY CANDLE LIGHT IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0024)
WHY ITS GOLIATH AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING IN	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0025)
ISN'T HE THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO ODD QUARTERS	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0026)
FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND SCURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING THE OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0027)
WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE HISTORY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0028)
NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0000)
I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW KAFIR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HANDS HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0001)
ONWARD SAID A DIFFERENT VOICE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0002)
NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF A NIGHT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0003)
THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCES CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0004)
WHAT WAS THIS	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0005)
BUT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0006)
NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST TO WHICH IT MAY BE ATTACHED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0007)
IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HANDS OF DEATH	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0008)
I WOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS KAFFIR	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0009)
A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHTNING	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0010)
A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAY WHERE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0011)
SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZE AS VOLTAIRE'S KAFFIR	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0012)
I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0013)
IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND WAS ALSO DISCOLORED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0014)
I DO NOT KNOW I'M DAZED BEWILDERED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0015)
BUT THAT IS KAVIR'S KNIFE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0016)
I KNOW HE HAS IT THIS VERY EVENING	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0017)
I REMEMBERED SAYING HAVE BEEN TOGETHER	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0018)
VOLTAIRE PICKED UP SOMETHING ON THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0019)
I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS YOU MUST TELL US	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0020)
A HORRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0021)
I HAD THEN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0022)
PERCHANCE TOO KAFFIR'S DEATH MAY SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0023)
MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEAVING ME	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0024)
OUR POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0025)
MY OVERROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0026)
FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I HEARD NOTHING DISTINCTLY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0027)
THE TWO MODES OF MANAGEMENT	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0000)
TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THE WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0001)
BY REASON AND AFFECTIONS	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0002)
AS THE CHAISE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE MASTER DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT REXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANISATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0003)
THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHAISE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY COULD NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0004)
YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0005)
THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY UPON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0006)
IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE WHILE WE ARE GONE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0007)
BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS NECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0008)
IT IS INDEED TRUE THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CANNOT BE OVERRATED	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0009)
TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCES ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0000)
DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0001)
NOW DELIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0002)
TO GET AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0003)
YOU HAVE COME ANDELLA ANDDELLA WAS THE NAME OF JANE'S DOLL TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0004)
IM VERY GLAD	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0005)
I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL ANDELLA SINCE YOU WERE HERE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0006)
AND TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0007)
FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0008)
THEY ARE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOUR	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0009)
DELIA CAME INTO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSALIE HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0010)
SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0011)
SAID SHE POINTING TO HER PLAYTHINGS SEE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0012)
PUT THOSE PLAYTHINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0013)
AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM COULD HAVE BEEN	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0014)
CASE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0000)
THAT WAS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0001)
THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FOR COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0002)
VAST INFLUENCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0003)
WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS ON THE MIND	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0004)
THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY AND THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0005)
BUT ANDS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0000)
HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE THOUGHT IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0001)
HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKKNIPE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0002)
NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED BUT ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKKNIFE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0003)
YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDRES	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0004)
SEEING THAT I AM SO BLIND I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0005)
I'M GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDREWS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0006)
AND SHE TOOK ANDERS'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0007)
BUT LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0008)
AT THE FURTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0009)
IN HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0010)
THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET ANDY SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0011)
BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND IS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0012)
THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE COULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0013)
HE ALMOST SHOOK HIS HEAD	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0014)
WELL NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0015)
THAT IS A VERY NICE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0016)
SO IT IS SAID ANDRES	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0017)
AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERY BODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0018)
WITH ONE JUMP AND OUT OF HIS CHAIR	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0019)
HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARDS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0020)
HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHERS COTTAGE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0021)
AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPENED	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0022)
AND WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0023)
AND HIS FACE GREW RED	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0024)
BUT HIS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSER	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0025)
NO MY LITTLE ONE SHE SAID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0026)
IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU CAN NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0027)
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THIS CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0000)
AH WELL	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0001)
LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AUQUAURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0002)

HE HAD GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0006)

HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLOURED SILK AND HOSE OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0017)

THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERYTHING PRESENT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0023)

THE PRINCESS INQUIRED NOW	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0006)
SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR TO WHICH SHE WAS GOING TO DANCE	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0007)
THAT ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM MORTALLY	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0008)
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATER BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER THIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0009)

GOODNESS GRACIOUS HAS THE KING ANY RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN MATTERS OF THAT KIND	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0035)
I WILL GIVE MY CONSENT	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0036)
O I AM SPEAKING SERIOUSLY REPLIED MONTALAIS AND MY OPINION IN THIS CASE IS QUITE AS GOOD AS THE KING'S I SUPPOSE IS IT NOT LOUISE	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0037)
LET US RUN THEN SAID ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE THICKEST COVERT OF THE PARK	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0038)
IN FACT THE SOUND OF MEDAMES AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTAIN CAVALIERS	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0039)
IN THIS WAY THE FETE OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FETE ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER IN THE BRAKE THE PHEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX IN HIS HOLE WERE ALL LISTENING	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0040)
ALL ABOUT HIM WAS THE TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOR SCATTERED IN BROAD SPLASHES	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0000)
THE MERGANSER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF IRIDESCENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PENCILLED IN BLACK AND WHITE AND BREAST OF RICH CHESTNUT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0001)
HIS TEETH WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW TOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0002)
BUT HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0003)
BUT SUDDENLY SWEET AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMORANT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0004)
ONCE FAIRLY TO WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PERCH	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0005)
IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THE SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0006)
BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WHITE FLUKES OF HIS ENGORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0007)
IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TO SOON	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0008)
THE GREAT HULK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO RETRIEVE ITS PREY FROM THE GROUND	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0009)
THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE OF HER JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0010)
IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM ROUND HIS STRAINED GULLET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0011)
THE HAWK ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCHES AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0012)
LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE IN SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0013)
THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED ITS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0014)
ALMOST INSTANTLY SHE WAS FORCED TO THE TOP	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0015)
STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK GLIDED FROM HIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER THEM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0016)
BUT AT THAT POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0017)
BUT THIS FREQUENTER OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0018)
AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WAS NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0019)
WHILE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0020)
BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HE HESITATED TO STRIKE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0021)
A HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0022)
HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CAST AND HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0023)
THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT GOT JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0024)
AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED ITS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0025)
THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT SHOCK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0026)
THEN THE LEADER PARTED FROM THE LION	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0027)
HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHANGE TO A SYMPOSIUM ON THE PRICE OF GOLF BALLS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0000)
IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PERMANENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0001)
BUT THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMATIST HAS HIS MOMENTS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0002)
YOUR PLAYING MUST BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0003)
FRANKLY I CANNOT ALWAYS SEE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0004)
BUT SUPPOSE YOU SAYS I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0005)
I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0006)
ANYHOW IT IS JOLLY EXCITING AND I CAN DO THE DIALOGUE ALL RIGHT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0007)
LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STATES CRAFT IS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0008)
AND I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HOMILY OF SOLILOQUY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0009)
HIM DO BE OR NOT TO BE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0010)
NOW THE OBJECT OF THE SOLILOQUY IS PLAIN	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0011)
INDEED IRRESOLUTION BEING THE KEYNOTE OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JAWS BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEANING	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0012)
YOU MODERNS HOWEVER SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0013)
IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHT OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO THE MODERN STAGE TECHNIQUE HOW SHALL A SOLILOQUY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0014)
AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN OPHELIA MIGHT SAY YES OR SOMETHING NONCOMMITTAL OF THAT SORT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0015)
THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WILL NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0016)
IN THE OLD SADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0017)
IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS EM WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0018)

THE CROWD DRIFTS OFF LEAVING THE HERO AND HEROINE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE AND THEN YOU BEGIN	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0036)
THIS IS THE TIME TO INTRODUCE A MEAL ON THE STAGE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0037)
A STAGE MEAL IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVES TO THE AUDIENCE THAT THE ACTORS EVEN WHEN CALLED CHARLES HOLTREE OR OWEN NOIRS ARE REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0038)
TEA PLEASE MATTHEW'S BUTLER IMPASSIVELY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0039)

TWO BITES ARE MADE AND THE BREAD IS CRUMBLED WITH AN AIR OF GREAT EAGERNESS INDEED ONE FEELS THAT IN REAL LIFE THE GUEST WOULD CLUTCH HOLD OF THE FOOTMAN AND SAY HALF O OLD CHAP I HAVEN'T NEARLY FINISHED BUT THE ACTOR IS BETTER SCHOOLED THAN THIS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0043)
BUT IT IS THE CIGARET WHICH CHIEFLY HAS BROUGHT THE MODERN DRAMA TO ITS PRESENT STATE OF PERFECTION	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0044)
LORD JOHN TAKING OUT GOLD CIGARETTE CASE FROM HIS LEFT HAND WAISTCOAT POCKET	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0045)

THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STATE GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0002)
FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS A TWO THOUSAND BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN THE SCALE	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0003)

THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH ON THE MORE SALIENT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN KANSAS WHICH HAPPILY ARE NOT SANGUINARY IF HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE ISOLATED CASES OF BLOODSHED COULD BE DESCRIBED THEY WOULD SHOW A STARTLING AGGREGATE OF BARBARITY AND A LOSS OF LIFE FOR OPINION'S SAKE	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0011)
SEVERAL THOUSAND FREE STATE MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0012)

THE GOVERNOR ON HIS PART BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF THE LEGALITY OF EMPLOYING MISSOURI MILITIA TO ENFORCE KANSAS LAW WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HELP OF FEDERAL TROOPS	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0016)

BUT THE FEAR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE FREE STATE MEN WERE INSURRECTIONISTS AND OUTLAWS	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0021)
FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICADES AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMPS AND SCOUT PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GUERRILLA BANDS HALF PARTISAN HALF PREDATORY	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0022)

THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOT SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISGUST TO THE BEST CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND ACCESSORIES	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0041)

CAPTAIN MARTIN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU THE PISTOL TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORST	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0045)
IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINTH A COMPANY OF DRAGOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PRO SLAVERY MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIES TO LE COMPTON IN CHARGE OF OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0046)
THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNSEL AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0000)
AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF MURCHETON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0001)
WHILST THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0002)
THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSE'S COUNSELS WHO PROPOSE NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE IN SCOTLAND	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0003)
FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCOE WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0004)
DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLEY AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN HASTILY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0005)
THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR LITERARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0006)
BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THEIR GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0007)
WITH THESE AND SOME REINFORCEMENTS OF THE ATHOL MEN AND MACDONALDS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLES'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0008)
THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INNERLOCHY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0009)
BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNERLOCHY AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTED COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0010)
HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE BECAME CONSPICUOUS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0011)
MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THE FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0012)
FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS WOULD RELY ON	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0013)
BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0014)
THOUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY PARTY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0015)
VALOUR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMED STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0016)
HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANY THING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINE THE SUCCESS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0017)
HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW UPON THE HILL	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0000)
THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD ON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0001)
THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0002)
AND HATH HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0003)
AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE MANY PART IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0004)
ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED A PSALM TO BE SUNG	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0005)
THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THE WORDS	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0006)
HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN SHOULD ME DEVOUR	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0007)
THIS GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0008)
THE PIRATE AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0009)
FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0010)
THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THIS SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0011)
IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCOUR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILST HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0012)
HIS DEATH IN THAT CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0013)
THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WOULD OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0000)
WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATIONS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0001)
WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0002)
AND WHAT SORT OF EVENTS IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0003)
THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE CENTURIES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0004)
ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE THE LOGICAL TUNABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0005)
THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THIS RECORD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0006)
HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIORIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIME	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0007)
BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH A INFERENCE IS WARRANTED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0008)
OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEANING IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0009)
WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE AND YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0010)
SOME IMAGES OF SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0011)
FAMILIARITY IS A FEELING INCAPABLE OF DEGREES	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0012)
IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHERE THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0013)
I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0014)
THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRED TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0015)
IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS OF SOME REMEMBERED EVENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0016)
THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH SHOULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0017)
THERE IS OF COURSE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0018)
IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0019)
IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR OBJECT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0020)
REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0021)
SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS SOME THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0022)
IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAINLY IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0023)
THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT HERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0024)
WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMEDIENCY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0025)
THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW AN THEORY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0026)
A GRAMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKED TO BELIEVE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0027)
I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAVE TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0028)
THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAD RECITED OR READ IT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0029)
SIMMONDS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TEACH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0030)
THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST APPEARANCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0031)
IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY AND KNOWLEDGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0032)
IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAD AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0033)
WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THAT IS FAMILIAR	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0034)
THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM A FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0035)
A FIRST STAGE IS RECOGNITION	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0036)
RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THAT MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0037)
WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNISE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THE FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0038)
THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE ALTHOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0039)
THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN AMOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0040)
THIS DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0041)
THUS IF I RECOGNISE THE THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNISE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0042)
OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND IS QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0043)
I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0000)
HAD EVA CRESWELL NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINGTON OVAL REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BUNNETT AND THE BARKEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0001)
ON ARRIVING AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT OUR SALON WAS FILLED WITH THE BRILLIANT COMPANY	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0002)
AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GREAT BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0003)
I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS DIFFERENT QUARTER OF THE WORLD	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0004)
WE HAVE OUR LITTLE STRUGGLES HERE AS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE WITH ROSE WATER	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0005)
