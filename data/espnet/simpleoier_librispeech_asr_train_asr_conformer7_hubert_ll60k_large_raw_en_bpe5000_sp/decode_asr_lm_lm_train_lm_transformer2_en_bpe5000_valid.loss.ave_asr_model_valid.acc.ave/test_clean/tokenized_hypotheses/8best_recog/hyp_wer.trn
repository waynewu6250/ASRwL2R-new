IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0018)

IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUSK TO A TAWNY GLOW	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0037)
I COULD WAIT NO LONGER	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0000)
FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE WOULD WAIT NO LONGER	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0001)
HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE TO THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0002)
THIS UNIVERSITY	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0003)
PRIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW FLAMES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0004)
WHOSE FEET ARE AS THE FOOT OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0005)
THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD RECOGNIZED	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0006)
SOON THE WHOLE BRIG WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0007)
THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASY AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0008)
ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWISE INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK HATS AND HUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKEY	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0009)
BROTHER MACARDAL BROTHER KIELF	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0010)
THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAY A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0011)
IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARD THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGARS WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0012)
IDLE AND EMBITTERING ONLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0013)
THE FACE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN ACCORD	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0014)

THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NOMADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0016)
THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEYS AND WOOD BEGIRT AND CITADELED AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARSHALLED RACES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0017)
AND AGAIN AGAIN	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0018)
A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALLED	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0019)
HOLLO STEPHANOS HERE COMES THE DAEDALUS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0020)

HE STOOD STILL IN DEFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BANTERS WITH EASY WORDS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0022)
IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THEIR SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0023)

THEY UNITE EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERRING TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS KIOSCURISTS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0001)
BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOUR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CUROSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLOURISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0002)
MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL ASSISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUE SIDE BY SIDE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0003)
SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAD BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0004)
IT'S THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPATIUS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0005)
THEN IT COMES TO THE BEAK OF IT	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0006)
THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK IS PUT ON THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY DEFINE THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0007)
FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY PERCEIVE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0008)
NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS INCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEY ARE GRADATED JUSTLY	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0009)
BUT IN THIS VIGNETTE COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0010)
THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAT I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT UPON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVOURITE CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0011)
IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORIST WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOUR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THIS VIRTUE IS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0012)
I MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0013)
YOU DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL IS AN EASY ONE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0014)
THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTISE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0015)
THAT AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELLER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0016)
THAT A SMILE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0017)
IN ALL EARTHLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND LABOR OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0018)
THAT LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0019)
BUT OBSERVE WE CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0020)
IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND SIMPLICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0021)
YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THEM	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0022)
THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PAROQUET WAS RUBY SO THAT NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGING AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0023)
NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THIS CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0024)
YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THE SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM IN CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0025)
HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MISTS THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO AND THE PYTHON	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0026)

WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNER'S GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STRONGEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0028)

IN BOTH OF THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOUGH SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0036)
EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF HOLBEIN OR DURE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0037)
BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW AT ALL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0038)

THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROAN IN THIS AND MUCH REPROACH AFTER WHICH IN HIS PREOCCUPIED WAY HE EXPLAINED	(121-127105-121-127105-0003)

I SHOULD WRITE TO MY MAN AND ENCLOSE THE KEY HE COULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FINDS IT	(121-127105-121-127105-0005)
THE OTHERS RESENTED POSTPONEMENT BUT IT IS JUST HIS SCRUPLES THAT CHARMED ME	(121-127105-121-127105-0006)

SHE IS BEEN DEAD THESE TWENTY YEARS	(121-127105-121-127105-0009)
SHE SENT THE PAGES IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED	(121-127105-121-127105-0010)
SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY	(121-127105-121-127105-0011)
IT WASN'T SIMPLY SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE	(121-127105-121-127105-0012)
YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE A THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME	(121-127105-121-127105-0013)
YOU ARE AWAKE	(121-127105-121-127105-0014)
HE QUITTED THE FIRE AND JUMPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR	(121-127105-121-127105-0015)
PROBABLY NOT TILL THE MORNING POST	(121-127105-121-127105-0016)
IT WAS ALWAYS THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STAY	(121-127105-121-127105-0017)
CRIED THE BOYS WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED	(121-127105-121-127105-0018)
MISSUS GRIFFIN HOWEVER EXPRESSED HER NEED FOR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT	(121-127105-121-127105-0019)

IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHO HE WAS	(121-127105-121-127105-0022)
LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH BETTER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE	(121-127105-121-127105-0023)
POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT UPON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH	(121-127105-121-127105-0024)
THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN AND THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED US UP	(121-127105-121-127105-0025)
THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THIS TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN	(121-127105-121-127105-0026)
HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE AND IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED	(121-127105-121-127105-0027)
THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL THIS TIME	(121-127105-121-127105-0028)
THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE OF SUPREME AUTHORITY	(121-127105-121-127105-0029)
I WON'T ANTICIPATE	(121-127105-121-127105-0030)
SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NEVERTHELESS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS	(121-127105-121-127105-0031)
YES BUT IT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION	(121-127105-121-127105-0032)
THIS WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT	(121-127105-121-127105-0033)
IT SOUNDED DULL BUT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF THE MAIN CONDITION WHICH WAS	(121-127105-121-127105-0034)
SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED NOT HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED	(121-127105-121-127105-0035)
BUT WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD OF THE LADIES ASKED	(121-127105-121-127105-0036)
HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE KINDLY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0000)
GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THE SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOREVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0001)
IF THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0002)
THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT FIRST	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0003)
THIS OUTWARD MUTABLY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0004)
HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PERIL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0005)
THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATE IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0006)
HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVED MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0007)
MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE NEARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0008)
AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARLS MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0009)
IT WAS THE LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0010)
BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FOR OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0011)
BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORDS THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0012)
WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0013)
PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY AND NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0014)
IF SPOKEN SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0015)
HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRAMED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0000)
ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENTS	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0001)
AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATIONS AND ACTS OF STATE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0002)
THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTESTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0003)
WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS AND BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0004)
IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER IN ENDOWED WITH LIFE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0005)
THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT A SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0006)
BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT A SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0007)
COME TOGETHER AND LET US FLING MUD AT THEM	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0008)
BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER HEAD AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0009)
SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUNDS WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0010)
IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHILE NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0011)
THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICED WINDOW THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0012)
LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOT A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0013)
YEA HIS HONOURABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKELY A LEECH	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0014)
THEY MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0015)
WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIR ESTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0016)
ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MUST HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0017)
LITTLE PEARLE WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTISPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREAST PLATE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0018)
MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK AND LOOK	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0019)
IN TRUTH THEY SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0020)
PEARLE ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOWS AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0021)
BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALWAYS TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0022)
THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A MULE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0023)
CHARLES SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0024)
HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEE PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WRIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0000)
HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN OF A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0001)
INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WILD CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0002)
FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH HE LIVED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0003)
WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE JACK SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0004)
NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR IN THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0005)
AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF A GILLIKINS THE PATH DIVIDED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0006)
HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN AND WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0007)
ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON FRANK AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0008)
THEN WE STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0009)
UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLACK OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0010)
I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME AT MY HOME	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0011)
WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN HIS A LONELIER PLACE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0012)
AND YOU WILL BE OJO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0013)
OGER HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0014)
WE ARE TRAVELING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0015)
THE WOMAN BECAME THOUGHTFUL	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0016)
AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH THE BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0017)
IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THE MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0018)
YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOMBI THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0019)
THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED UPON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0020)
I THINK THE FIRST GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0021)
I' AM AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0022)
YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH AUNT NUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0023)
THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJA THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0024)
I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGOLOTTE LAUGHING AT THE GIRL'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0025)
BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAD LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0026)
YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0027)
THE BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLOURS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0028)
SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND FEATHERS ARE SO MIXED UP	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0029)
WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GRASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLOURS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0030)
AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE THE PRINCESS OZMA LIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOUR	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0031)
I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DO AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0032)
OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE IN WONDER	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0000)
MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0001)
THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HIM	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0002)
THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SINGLE NEAT BRAIDS	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0003)
GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON MEDAL IN THE ISLAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0004)
NO I FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0005)
WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE WORK	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0006)
HE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0007)
I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED BUT THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0008)
SHE RETURNED TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR KETTLES FROM THE FIRE	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0009)
THEIR COATS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0010)
VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALL TOGETHER IN A GOLD DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0011)
NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMEN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0012)
OJO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH A THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0013)
HE SELECTED A SMALL COLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0014)

BRAVELY AND GENEROUSLY HAS HE BATTLED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS AND MORE WOULD I DARE IN HIS SERVICE	(1320-122617-1320-122617-0031)
KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS THEY SHOULD BE	(1320-122617-1320-122617-0032)

MY FRIEND'S TEMPERAMENT HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0002)
WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS A UNCOMFORTABLE MAN	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0003)

THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONGST MY PAPERS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0007)
THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLEEPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0008)
THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPER	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0009)
I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0010)

AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOLMES FOR I ENTERED BY THIS SIDE DOOR	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0026)
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0027)
THEN HE TOSSED IT OUT AND SEIZED THE NEXT	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0028)
HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THIS WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0029)
MISTER SOLMES WAS SOMEHOW OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0030)

HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HOLLOA WHAT IS THIS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0035)
HOLMES HELD IT UP ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0036)
WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP SOMETHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0037)
I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE WERE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0038)

I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE MOST UNLIKELY	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0044)
HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM SOME SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0045)
BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THINGS AT OTHER TIMES	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0046)

IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SILHOUETTE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON THIS BLIND	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0000)
WAS PACING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0001)
THIS SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0002)
NO NAMES PLEASE SAID HOLMES AS I KNOCKED AT GILCRIST'S DOOR	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0003)
OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WERE KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0004)
THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT SAID HOLMES	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0005)
YOU DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE THEIR POSITION	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0006)

I CANNOT ALLOW THE COMBINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0008)
IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0009)
I WILL TAKE THAT BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTINGS GOOD BY	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0010)
WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP TO THE WINDOWS	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0011)
THE FOUL MOUTHED FELLOW IN THE TOP	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0012)
IS THE ONE WITH THE WORST RECORD	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0013)
WHY BANNISTER THE SERVANTS WHAT'S HIS GAME IN THE MATTER	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0014)
THEY IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST MAN	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0015)
MY FRIENDS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0016)
NO BUT MY DEAR WATSON	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0017)

YES MY DEAR WATSON I HAVE SOLVED MY MYSTERY	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0019)
LOOKED AT THAT HE HELD OUT HIS HAND	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0020)
ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PYRAMIDS OF BLACK TOUGHY CLAY	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0021)
IN ONE MORE THIS MORNING	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0022)
IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE BUT HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0023)
HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION BUT HE RAN TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0024)
YOU KNOW HER I THINK SO	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0025)
IF THAT MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARTIAL	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0026)
NOT SIR CERTAINLY NOT	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0027)
THERE WAS NO TIME SIR	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0028)
HIS TROUBLED BLACK EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANNISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0029)
NOT CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOLMES	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0030)
WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GILCRET HOW YOU AN HONOURABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH AN ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0031)
FOR A MOMENT GILCRIST WITH UPRAISED HEAD TRIED TO CONTROL HIS WRITHING FEATURES	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0032)
COME COME SAID HOLMES KINDLY IT IS EASY TO ERR AND AT LEAST NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A CALLOUS CRIMINAL	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0033)

THE INDIAN I ALSO THOUGHT MUCH OF	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0036)
WHEN I APPROACHED HER ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0037)
NO ONE LESS THAN THIS WOULD HAVE A CHANCE	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0038)
I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE SIDE TABLE	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0039)
HE RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU ARE WEAR WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0040)
NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY THAT HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0041)
A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THE PROPHETS	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0042)
HE PUT HIS HANDS ON THE TABLE	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0043)
GLOVES SAID THE YOUNG MEN	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0044)
SUDDENLY SHE HEARD HIM AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0045)
HAS I TOLD THE TRUTH MISTER GILCREST	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0046)
I HAVE A LETTER HERE MISSUS SOLMES WHICH I WROTE TO YOU EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTLESS NIGHT	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0047)
IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU WOULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0048)
IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0049)
IF MISTER SOLMES SAW THE GAME WAS UP	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0050)
IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES THE DEFENSE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0000)
THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON AND NEW ORLEANS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0001)
MISTER TAYLOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTON	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0002)
BETTER GO SHE HAD COUNSELLED SENTENTIOUSLY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0003)
MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL OUT THERE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0004)
BUT JOHN THERE'S NO SOCIETY JUST ELEMENTARY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0005)
BE LOOKING UP TOMBES COUNTY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0006)
FIND SOME CRUS WELLS THERE BIG PLANTATIONS RATED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0007)
AND SOME OTHERS TOO BIG COTTON COUNTY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0008)
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES I'D SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0009)
AT ANY RATE I SAY DO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0010)
HERE SHE WAS TEACHING THIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODORS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0011)
SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALKING OF GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0012)
SO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TO DAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE MEADOWS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0013)
GARDEN SHE PAUSED	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0014)
SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE BETWEEN TOUCH AND SIGHT	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0015)
THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARDS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0016)
THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THAT PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0017)
HER GARDEN SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0018)
COTTON IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAYS RATHER PRIMLY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0019)
MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LAST ONE MORE REMARK SEEMED CALLED FOR	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0020)
I DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LITERALLY BORN IN COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0021)
I S'POSE THO IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0022)
GOOBLES DON'T GROW ON DE TOPS OF VINES BUT ON DE GROUND ON THE ROOTS LIKE YAMS IS THAT SO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0023)
THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HEARKENED TO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0024)
SOME TIMES YOU'LL TELL ME PLEASE WON'T YOU	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0025)
NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THAT CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTON	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0026)
THE HONORABLE CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UP TOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLEY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0000)
AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT THAT HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0001)
WHY SHOULD I NOT BE AS OTHER MEN	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0002)
SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN AND SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERS	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0003)
AS SHE AWAITED HER GUEST SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TO NIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CRICHTON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CRITON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0004)
MISSUS GRAY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE THE POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0005)
SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESVILLE EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0006)
DO YOU BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARIAN TAYLOR	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0007)
I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLES TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0008)
BUT CRESWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN RATES	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0009)
THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMEN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GREY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMS TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0010)
POSITIVELY HEROIC ADDED CROSWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0011)
BUT WE'RE NOT A EXACTLY WELCOME	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0012)
MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZORA TO MISS GRAY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0013)
FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING UPON MOST OF THESE MATTERS	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0014)
HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS AND ZORS MUST BE RUINED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0000)
IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT THE PHANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0001)
AH THE SWAMP THE CRUEL SWAMPS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0002)
THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN A BURNING WONDER	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0003)
HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW NOR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND KNEW NOT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0004)
SHE WAS SO STRONG AND HUMAN A CREATURE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0005)
THE WORLD WAS RATHER VEILED IN MISTS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0006)
THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STEEPED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0007)
WHO WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0008)
THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DIKES A WEEK AGO	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0009)
PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITED WEEPING	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0010)
HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH MADLY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0011)
HE SPLASHED AND STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREES BRIDGE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0012)
THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON IS DRY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0013)
HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BELOW LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0014)
THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST OF BOWLS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0015)
FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANING DIZZILY AGAINST A TREE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0016)
HE GAZED ROUND PERPLEXED ASTONISHED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0017)
HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE CARE AND PAINS SOME ONE HAD DUG A CANAL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0018)
HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST SOMEHOW	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0019)
THE HOURS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0020)
THE HOPE AND DREAD OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0021)
UP IN THE SICK ROOM ZORAH LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0022)
THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0023)
FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE OF SUN AND BIRD AND TREE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0024)
SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD INTO THE SWAMP	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0025)
SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDER SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MET HER LOVE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0026)
ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LO THE CONTINENT LAY BEFORE HER	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0027)
HIS CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0028)
HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND PAUSED THE TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0029)
IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOOR PLATE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0000)
BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT NEVER OPENED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0001)
FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0002)

AND WHAT THE LEFT HAND WINDOW	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0004)
SEVEN CLOTHES HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLORED RAGS	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0005)
IN THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0006)
THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSES IS PLAIN NOW	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0007)
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH MONEY IN IT AS POSSIBLE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0008)

HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0010)
DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY OF FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHT HEADED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0011)
THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THE CONTRASTS BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0012)
HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER THE DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0013)
THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WIDDERS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0014)
TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE COULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0015)
SPINNINGS INDEED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0016)

WHO TAUGHT YOU TO SCRUB A FLOOR I SHALL LIKE TO KNOW	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0018)
COMB THE WOOL FOR THE WIDOWS IN DEED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0019)
THAT'S WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE DOING IS	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0020)

NO NO NO TOTTY'D GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER APRON	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0028)
DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STRING	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0029)
TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT IN THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0030)
AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO AUNT ROSA	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0031)
I HAD OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0032)
WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH AND YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I FOUND IT SO	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0033)
AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS OF SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TOWLING THAT ISN'T MADE UP	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0034)
BUT MORE THAN WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE AUNT SAID DINAH	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0035)
NAY DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK AND THEIR FAMILY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0036)
WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR LOT WAS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE FITS US FOR IT AND CALLS US TO IT	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0037)
I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING WHEN YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0038)
I HAVE STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING I HAVE DONE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0039)
I DIDN'T PITCH WITHOUT DIRECTION	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0040)
A DIRECTION	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0041)
I HAD A FINE PATIENCE WITH YOU	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0042)
BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALING AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT WAS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO COME IN	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0043)
MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0044)
YES SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0045)
I DELIGHT IN YOUR COMMISSION	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0046)
POYSER NOT AT HOME IS HE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0047)
SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE OVER THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0048)
NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSITUR TO SEE MISSUS WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOOL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0049)
BUT THERE'S FATHER AT THE BARN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0050)
NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WHELPS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERDS	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0051)
I MUST COME EVERY DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0052)
AND IF HE'S ANYWHERE ON THE FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0053)
OH SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE AT ALL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0054)
BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DID SIR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0055)
I THINK I MUST BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0056)
I KNOW YOUR FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0057)
BY THE BYE I'VE NOT SEEN YOUR DAIRY I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY MISSUS POYSER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0058)
THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADDRESS HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0059)
OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT IS IN CAPITAL ORDER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0060)
THE PARIS PLANT LIKE THAT AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE IS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0000)
THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS NECESSARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0001)
THERE MESSRS JOHNSON AND HAMNER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0002)
THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE YEARS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0003)
OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY ARTIFICIAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0004)
WHY IF WE ERECT A STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP THE CITY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0005)
THERE SEEMED NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0006)
BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEAT THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0007)
EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE AND INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0008)
FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATED CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0009)
IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATION OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0010)
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING THE SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARM HOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0011)
EDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT WOULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALVANOMETER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0012)
UNLESS HE COULD PROCURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0013)
MISTER EDISON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIMES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0014)
HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR THE INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0015)
THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED HIS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0016)
EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GRAND CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0017)
HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0018)
THIS STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0019)
IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMBS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0020)
THE STREET CONDUCTORS ARE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0021)
MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHNSON HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0022)
I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING ON THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0023)
BUT THE PLANET RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0024)
THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF ODYSONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0025)
THE ARK LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THE RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0026)
EDISON HELD THAT ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METRE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0027)
THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THIS SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0028)
HENCE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METTER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0029)
THE PRINCIPAL EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METRE IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0030)
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0031)
THE STANDARD EDISON METER PRACTICAL WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0032)
IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS AND THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METRE THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0033)
THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS THOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BASIS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0034)
IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METER WAS ACTIVE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0035)
THE METER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0036)
HE WEIGHED AND RE WEIGHED THE MEER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0037)
HE FELT THAT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0038)
MY PROBLEM WAS SOLVED	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0039)
WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PARTS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0040)
WE HAD METRES IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUOR	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0041)
HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHING AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME	(237-126133-237-126133-0000)
EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY UPON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS	(237-126133-237-126133-0001)
WELL DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS	(237-126133-237-126133-0002)

IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE PHRONSIE JUST ONE MOMENT	(237-126133-237-126133-0004)
OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID DAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED	(237-126133-237-126133-0005)

ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENT INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE	(237-126133-237-126133-0014)
YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY AT THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE	(237-126133-237-126133-0015)
OH NO JAPSTER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF	(237-126133-237-126133-0016)
THAT JAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE	(237-126133-237-126133-0017)
I DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER TWASN'T HER FAULT	(237-126133-237-126133-0018)
DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO KEEP HER HERE TOO	(237-126133-237-126133-0019)
HOW DID MOTHER EVER LET HER GO	(237-126133-237-126133-0020)
SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER MOTHER	(237-126133-237-126133-0021)
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WROTE IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY	(237-126133-237-126133-0022)
HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE MEADOWS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY	(237-126133-237-126133-0023)
AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER WHICH OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME	(237-126133-237-126133-0024)
AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIVIDLY	(237-126133-237-126133-0025)

HANS STIRS	(260-123288-260-123288-0014)
FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL EMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS A CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLECULES THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM	(260-123288-260-123288-0015)

OH WON'T SHE BE SORRY IF I'VE KEPT HER WAITING	(260-123440-260-123440-0003)

IT'LL BE NO USE THEIR PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME UP AGAIN SIR	(260-123440-260-123440-0012)
I' AM SO VERY TIRED OF BEING ALL ALONE HERE	(260-123440-260-123440-0013)
AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD AS IT IS	(260-123440-260-123440-0014)
I WISH I HADN'T TRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT	(260-123440-260-123440-0015)
I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN THOUGHTS	(260-123440-260-123440-0016)

CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE HOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED	(260-123440-260-123440-0019)
WE WON'T TALK OF HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE INDEED	(260-123440-260-123440-0020)
WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKETS WILL YOU DO IT	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0000)
THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAM LINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TODAY TO AMERICANS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0001)
LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON GARATIONS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0002)
THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND THE TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0003)
IT WAS WRITTEN ON LATIN	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0004)
THE WALK HAD TO BE CONDENSED	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0005)
A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY INGULATIONS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0006)
MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY ALLATIONS FOR INSTANCE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0007)
IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATATIONS AND ROER PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0008)
IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THAT JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0009)
BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES WAS THERE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0010)
THE LORD WHO HATH GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE TWO	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0011)
THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOR ALL	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0012)
IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITIES OF SAINT PAUL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0000)
THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0001)
HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO GRANT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0002)
PAUL CAME LATER AND WAS BENEATH US	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0003)
EVEN HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0004)
DO YOU THINK THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0005)
AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITIES AND MINISTRY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0006)
AS THE AMBASSADOR OF OUR GOVERNMENT IS HONOURED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0007)
PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO ITS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0008)
CALL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0009)
EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0010)
PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED ARE SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0011)
THE MOST WE COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0012)
HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED DIRECTLY BY GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0013)
THE CALL IS NOT TO BE GIVEN LIGHTLY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0014)
BUT A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0015)
IT SPOILS ONE'S BEST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0016)
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT TOM WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0017)
I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MY MINISTRY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0018)
I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NO BODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0019)
THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS A HOLY PRIDE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0020)
AS GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0021)
THE CLAUSE SEEMS SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0022)
THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST EXIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0023)
IN THIS WHOLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF A RESURRECTION OF CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0024)
BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER SOUL SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0025)
AT FIRST TWO	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0026)
AND ALL THE WOMEN WHICH ARE WITH ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0027)
THESE SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0028)
ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME WERE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS I DO	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0029)
THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS WERE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0030)
WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE OF GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0031)
WE LOOKED FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0032)
NOT ALL THE GARATIONS HAD BECOME PERVERTED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0033)
THOSE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0034)
THEY RAN DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0035)
WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNED THERE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0036)
SO MUCH TO THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0037)
GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD AND FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0038)
THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0039)
THE GREETING OF THAT APOSTLE IS REFRESHING	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0040)
GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0041)
THE WORLD BRANDS IT A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0042)
EXPERIENCE PROVES THUS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0043)
HOWEVER THE GRACE AND GRACE OF GOD WILL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0044)
MEN SHOULD NEVER SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0045)
WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAVE FROM THE FATHER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0046)
TO DO SO IS TO LOVE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0047)
HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON THEM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0048)
EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THAT NATURE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0049)
DOES NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0050)
WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE IDEA OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0051)
WE ARE TO RECEIVE CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0052)
AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS HER CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0053)
THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0054)
TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE COULD CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0055)
OTHERWISE PAUL WOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0056)
THE ARIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE IN HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0057)
MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF GRACE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0058)
PAUL STICKS TO HIS THEMES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0059)
HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF ITS EPISTLE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0060)
NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASHIAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0061)
NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SONS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0062)
UNDERSCORE THOSE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0063)
HOW SHALL WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0064)
PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AS THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0065)
SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY THEIR OWN EFFORTS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0066)
THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0067)
THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES IT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0068)
THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF TO OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0069)
BUT WE ARE JEALOUS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0070)
WE THINK THAT WITH SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0071)
THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD ON SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0072)
THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEAR NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0073)
THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PERFECTLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0074)
BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS OF OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0075)
ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD HIM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0076)
HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MEN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTURB SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE	(2961-960-2961-960-0000)
THE INFLUENCE WHICH A TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING	(2961-960-2961-960-0001)
IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEO PLATINISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS IN CONNECTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO	(2961-960-2961-960-0002)
THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALISE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL	(2961-960-2961-960-0003)
THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS UPON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEOPLATINISTS	(2961-960-2961-960-0004)
IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT	(2961-960-2961-960-0005)
THE FANCIES OF THE NEOP LATINISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY	(2961-960-2961-960-0006)
AND THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM	(2961-960-2961-960-0007)
WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF EM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAD EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND	(2961-960-2961-960-0008)
THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THAT TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS	(2961-960-2961-960-0009)
BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHAT BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL	(2961-960-2961-960-0010)
WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE ANXAGORLAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER	(2961-960-2961-960-0011)
MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE VISOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS	(2961-960-2961-960-0012)
IT IS PROBABLE THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE	(2961-960-2961-960-0013)
THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS AND FISHES	(2961-960-2961-960-0014)
THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHERS OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES	(2961-960-2961-960-0015)
BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PHIDRES OR SYMPOSIUM	(2961-960-2961-960-0016)
NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE HAS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER	(2961-960-2961-960-0017)
BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THAT DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP	(2961-960-2961-960-0018)
HE CAN WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA	(2961-960-2961-960-0019)
AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM OF LUCRETIUS	(2961-960-2961-960-0020)
THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIER WRITINGS	(2961-960-2961-960-0021)
PLATO HAD NOT THE DEMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART	(2961-960-2961-960-0022)
SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEAS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC	(2961-961-2961-961-0000)
AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN THAT GREAT STRUGGLE	(2961-961-2961-961-0001)
AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIAS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE	(2961-961-2961-961-0002)
I WILL IF TIMAEUS APPROVES I REFUSE	(2961-961-2961-961-0003)
LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SALIUS WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF TROPIDUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME	(2961-961-2961-961-0004)
SOME POEMS OF SAMUEL WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS	(2961-961-2961-961-0005)
AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THAT POEM SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK	(2961-961-2961-961-0006)
THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE ARE EVER ENGAGED	(2961-961-2961-961-0007)
BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THEIR ACTORS	(2961-961-2961-961-0008)
TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SOLOMON HEARD THIS STORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0009)
BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHERS LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES	(2961-961-2961-961-0010)
THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNALS ALONE ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0011)
FOR IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN	(2961-961-2961-961-0012)
SULLEN MARVELED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS	(2961-961-2961-961-0013)
NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED HERS AS OUR ANNALS RECORD	(2961-961-2961-961-0014)
MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH IS THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME	(2961-961-2961-961-0015)
I SHALL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS	(2961-961-2961-961-0016)
OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE THE LAW TOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN	(2961-961-2961-961-0017)
THE MOST DANGEROUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS	(2961-961-2961-961-0018)
AND AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE OTHER HELLENES HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS	(2961-961-2961-961-0019)
THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH WERE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN	(2961-961-2961-961-0020)
BUT I WILL NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0021)
THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF THEM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORDS SPOKE	(2961-961-2961-961-0022)
BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE DAY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0000)
THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IT IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0001)
SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0002)
WITH THE FURTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS TABOO MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABOOS OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0003)
IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONGS TO THE LEISURE CLASS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0004)
UNDER THAT TABOO CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0005)
DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THAT SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0006)
IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT A NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0007)
THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IT IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0008)
WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAD GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0009)
THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THE RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0010)
THAT CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0011)
THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF TRACK AND GRATES	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0012)
THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0013)
MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF MEASURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0014)
SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP A RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0015)
MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMERS IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANT RETAINERS ET CETERA	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0016)
THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OF LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0017)
THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE ARE THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0018)
AND THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0019)
SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE SIMPLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0020)
WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT USUALLY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONORIFIC CHARACTER	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0021)
THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE PREPARED TO WEAR IT	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0022)
IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY AND CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0000)
THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES IS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0001)
BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LABOUR AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0002)
IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0003)
IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES THROUGH A GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0004)
THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLDS PECUNIARY DECENCY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0005)
VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET AND THE LAST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0006)
THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY WHICH HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0007)
THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONNECTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0008)
IT WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0009)
A MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0010)
IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF A DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0011)
IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE OF IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0012)
CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN A STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0013)
AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEIGHBORHOOD GOSSIPS SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0014)
THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMAN	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0015)
UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND PLEASURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0000)
BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE CORSAN PEACEABLE CULTURE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0001)

A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO AN ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE	(5105-28240-5105-28240-0023)

EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0014)
TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM DEPTH OF FROM FOUR TO FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SITE OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRACED LIKE THE SEATS OF A AMPHITHEATRE	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0015)
YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALGERIA AS WE IMAGINED	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0016)

ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARREN OF A MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0018)
NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT OUT AND RETURN IN DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARDS THE NORTH	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0019)

THIS TRUTH WHICH I LEARNED FROM HER LIPS IS CONFIRMED BY HIS FACE IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH BEHELD THAT OF OUR SON	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0029)
JUST THEN LEOCADIA CAME TO HERSELF AND EMBRACING THE CROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO A SEA OF TEARS AND THAT GENTLEMAN REMAINING IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END LEOCADIA'S WHOLE STORY AND HE BELIEVED IT THROUGH THE BLESSED DISPENSATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONFIRMED IT BY SO MANY CONVINCING TESTIMONIES	(5639-40744-5639-40744-0030)

I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON HIM	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0010)
WHEREUPON LINCOLN LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0011)

THE AXE STRUCK DEEP TO THE VERY PITH THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANG IT WAS LIKE A SWOON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPRUNG UP	(672-122797-672-122797-0022)
HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANY MORE PERHAPS EVEN THE BIRDS	(672-122797-672-122797-0023)
MY DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE	(672-122797-672-122797-0024)
THAT TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS	(672-122797-672-122797-0025)
THERE TOO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WORTH HUNDREDS IN HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO	(672-122797-672-122797-0026)
THE SOLDIERS AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LADIES DECORATED IT	(672-122797-672-122797-0027)

PERHAPS THE OTHER TREE FROM THE FOREST WILL COME TO LOOK AT ME	(672-122797-672-122797-0030)
IT BLAZED OUT FAMOUSLY HELP HELP	(672-122797-672-122797-0031)
CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THEIR FIRE	(672-122797-672-122797-0032)
STOREY	(672-122797-672-122797-0033)
A STORY CRIED THE CHILDREN DRAWING THE LITTLE FAT MAN TOWARD THE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0034)
BUT I SHALL TELL ONE STORY	(672-122797-672-122797-0035)
HUMPY DUMPY FELL UPSTAIRS AND YET HE MARRIED THE PRINCESS	(672-122797-672-122797-0036)
THAT S THE WAY OF THE WORLD	(672-122797-672-122797-0037)
THOUGHT THE FIR TREE AND BELIEVED IT ALL BECAUSE THAT MAN WHO TOLD THE STORY WAS SO GOOD LOOKING WELL WELL	(672-122797-672-122797-0038)
I WON'T TREMBLE TO NIGHT THOUGHT THE FIR TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0039)
FOR THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT	(672-122797-672-122797-0040)
IN THE MORNING THE SERVANT OF THE HOUSEMAID CAME IN	(672-122797-672-122797-0041)
BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STEPS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM	(672-122797-672-122797-0042)
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT OF THE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0043)
AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIES	(672-122797-672-122797-0044)
TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME OUT AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY	(672-122797-672-122797-0045)
THIS IS NOW WINTER OUT OF DOORS THOUGHT THE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0046)
HOW KINDLY MAN IS AFTER ALL	(672-122797-672-122797-0047)
IF IT ONLY WERE NOT SO BLACK HERE AND SO TERRIBLY LONELY	(672-122797-672-122797-0048)
SQUEAK AND SQUEAK	(672-122797-672-122797-0049)
THEY SNUFFED ABOUT THE FIR TREE AND RUSTLED AMONGST THE BRANCHES	(672-122797-672-122797-0050)
I AM BY NO MEANS ALL SAID THE FIR TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0051)
IT'S MANY A ONE CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN I AM	(672-122797-672-122797-0052)
THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY FURIOUS	(672-122797-672-122797-0053)
I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE PRIEST	(672-122797-672-122797-0054)
AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEN LISTENED AND SAID	(672-122797-672-122797-0055)
SAID THE FIR TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF RESOLVED	(672-122797-672-122797-0056)
YES IN REALITY THOSE WERE HAPPY DAYS	(672-122797-672-122797-0057)
WHO WAS HUMPY DUMPY ASKED THE MICE	(672-122797-672-122797-0058)
ONLY THAT ONE THE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0059)
IT'S A VERY STUPID STORY	(672-122797-672-122797-0060)
DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BACON AND TALLOW CANDLES CAN'T YOU TELL ANY LARDER	(672-122797-672-122797-0061)
OH SAID THE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0062)
THEN GOOD BYE SAID THE LADS AND THEY WENT HOME	(672-122797-672-122797-0063)
AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALSO AND A TREE SIGHED AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN THE SLEEK LITTLE MICE SAT ROUND ME AND LISTENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM	(672-122797-672-122797-0064)
WELL THAT TOO IS OVER	(672-122797-672-122797-0065)
WELL ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT	(672-122797-672-122797-0066)
THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE	(672-122797-672-122797-0067)
BUT IT WAS NOT THE FIR TREE THAT I MEANT	(672-122797-672-122797-0068)
IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE FELL AMONG WEEDS AND NETTLES	(672-122797-672-122797-0069)
THE GOLDEN STAR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THAT TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE	(672-122797-672-122797-0070)
IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MERRYAT CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM	(672-122797-672-122797-0071)
AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING HERE	(672-122797-672-122797-0072)
THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BREWING COPPER AND IT DIED SO DEEPLY	(672-122797-672-122797-0073)
HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TEA GONE THE STORY AT AN END	(672-122797-672-122797-0074)
KENNETH AND BETH REFRAINED FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGERS'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORGING THE CHECK	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0000)
IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHLY TERM IN THE STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0001)
I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAYS THE OLD LAWYER	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0002)
IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYER TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0003)
BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0004)
HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE WOULDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0005)
IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF A FORGED CHEQUE THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0006)
BUT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0007)
FAIRVIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY GATE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0008)

WE FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG A SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0014)
SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARNING FOR SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORTH DYING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0015)
HE UNLOCKED THAT DOOR AND CALLED HERE'S VISITORS TOM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0016)

SIT DOWN PLEASED SAID GATES IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A BENCH HERE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0020)
A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GATES WITH STEADY GREY EYES AND INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0021)
WE HAVE HEARD NOTHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0022)
I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NO I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0023)
OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND CARELESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0024)
AND ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEAD HER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0025)
HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN A NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0026)
WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE CHEQUE SAID KENNETH	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0027)
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHEQUES OF THE CONCERN	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0028)
IT'S A STOCK COMPANY UNRICH	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0029)
I WAS BACK KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0030)
AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THAT COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0031)
I DISCOVERED IT PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARSHALL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0032)
IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRLS UNFEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0033)
I' AM GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0034)
IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT I M GRATEFUL TO FIND A FRIEND	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0035)
THEY LEFT HIM THEN BUT THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0036)
I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN MY TIME	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0037)
AND IT RUINS A MAN'S DISPOSITIONS	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0038)
HE LOOKED UP VERY UNGRACIOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0039)
SOME GIRL HAS BEEN IN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0040)
I' M NOT ELECTIONEERING JUST NOW	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0041)
OH WELL WHAT ABOUT HIM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0042)
AND HE DESERVES A TURN IN STATE'S PRISON	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0043)
IT HAS COST ME SIXTY DOLLARS AN ANNOYANCE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0044)
I'LL PAY ALL THAT COST BESIDES	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0045)
YOU'RE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THAT	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0046)
I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MASTER MARSHALL	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0047)
GIVE ME A CHEQUE FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGED CHECK AND QUASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0048)
HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT COULD ENDEAVOUR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATES	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0049)
BETH UNEASY AT THE SILENCE NUDGED HIM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0050)
THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS HUGE FACE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0051)
HE MIGHT HAVE THAT FORGED CHEQUE FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0052)
AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THIS MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0053)

THAT WEAK NEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM OPPOSITION	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0002)
THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED A WAY TO DO THIS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0003)
UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS REYNOLDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE RESOLVED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPKINS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0004)
THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH REYNOLDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED SPECIALLY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0005)
AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG MAN IN THE BUGGY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0006)
THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTE WHO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0007)
THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN COLLECTING MISTER FORBES	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0008)
LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE ON WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0009)

TABLES ARE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIAL REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0011)
THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION IN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESTS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0012)
THE ATTENDANCE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FORESEEING GREAT SUCCESS IN THEIR FIGHT	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0013)
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTENDANCE BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0014)
WON'T YOU RUN INTO THAT HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0015)
SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THE MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER ESPECIAL FAVORITE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0016)
THE SOLDIER LED THE WAY AND BETH FOLLOWED	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0017)
FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE LITTLE MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND A SLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0018)
SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST A PLAIN BLACK GOWN WITH THE WHITE APRON AND CAP	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0019)

YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE IS YOUR HOUSE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0023)
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HIS VISITOR	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0024)
SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS ON HER LAP ROCKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0025)

BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELIZA SURPASSED HER IN NATURAL CHARMS AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0029)
HER MANNER WAS NEITHER DIGNIFIED NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0030)
HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAN'S HANDS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0031)
HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORM MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE LINES TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0032)
SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH A IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH HER BREATH	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0033)
I WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE REPLIED FIERCELY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0034)

YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOMS	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0020)
SURFACE DUST AT LAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0021)
THEN SHE SUDDENLY SMILED	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0022)
AND MY POCKET MONEY WAS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0023)
THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLE LIGHT WAS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0024)
WHY IT'S GOLIATH AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0025)
ISN'T HE THE GENIUS FOR GETTING INTO ODD CORNERS	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0026)
FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND SCURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ONE OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0027)
WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE STORY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0028)
NO WORD WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0000)
I HEARD THE NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW KAFFIR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0001)
INWARD SAID A DISTANT VOICE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0002)
NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESSES OF THE NIGHT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0003)
THE STORY OF THEIR EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0004)
WHAT WAS THE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0005)
WHY THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0006)
NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST TO WHICH IT MUST BE ATTACHED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0007)
HE DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0008)
I WOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS KAFIR	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0009)
A SOUND OF VOICES A CRASH OF LIGHT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0010)
A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE THERE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0011)
SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH HE RECOGNIZED AS VOLTAIRE'S KAFFIR	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0012)
I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HEAD	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0013)
IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HANDS TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLORED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0014)
I DO NOT KNOW I I AM DAZED BEWILDERED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0015)
BUT IT IS KAFFIR'S KNIFE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0016)
I THINK HE HAD IT THIS VERY EVENING	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0017)
I REMEMBERED SAYING HAVE YOU BEEN TOGETHER	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0018)
VOLTAIRE PULLED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0019)
I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU WILL TELL US	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0020)
A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO HIS MIND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0021)
I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWERS	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0022)
PERCHANCE TOO THE KAFFIR'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0023)
WHEN MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEFT ME	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0024)
MY POSITION WAS SO TERRIBLE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0025)
HIS OVERWROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0026)
FOR SOMETIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0027)
THE THREE MOODS OF MANAGEMENT	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0000)
TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0001)
MY REASON AND AFFECTION	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0002)
AS THE CHAISE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE MASTER DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT REXATION AND ILL HUMOR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANISATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0003)
THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHAISE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH THE SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0004)
SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD BOY I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0005)
THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON THE APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0006)
IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL OR SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0007)
BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN ARTIFICIALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0008)
IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THEIR YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CANNOT BE OVERRATED	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0009)
TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INCLINATION ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0000)
DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS KATE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0001)
NOW DELIA CONTRIVED TO ATTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0002)
TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0003)
YOU HAVE GONE ANDELLA AND DELLA WAS THE NAME OF JANE'S DOLL TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0004)
I I AM VERY GLAD	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0005)
I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL AND NEVER SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0006)
THEN TURNING TO JANE HE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0007)
FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR IN THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0008)
THEY ARE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOR	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0009)
DELIA CAME TO THE PARLOUR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN OUTSIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSALIE HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0010)
SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND DOWN BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0011)
SAID SHE POINTING TO THEIR PLAYTHINGS SEE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0012)
PUT THESE PLAYTHINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0013)
AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE DONE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0014)
NATURE IN THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0000)
THERE IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0001)
THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM THE COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0002)
VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS GENTLE FURNISHING	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0003)
WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THAT PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0004)
THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON WILL SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0005)
BUT ANDERS CARED NOTHING OF THAT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0000)
HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING BUT HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0001)
HE WAS SUCH A BIG FELLOW THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKKNIFE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0002)
NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ASERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKKNIFE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0003)
YET WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0004)
SEEING THAT I AM SO KIND I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0005)
I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDRES	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0006)
THEN SHE TOOK ANDER'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0007)
FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE HOUSE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0008)
AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGERST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0009)
ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLIMMERING DECANTERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0010)
THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET ANDS SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0011)
BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE OFF	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0012)
THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THAT CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0013)
HE ONLY SHOOK ITS HEAD	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0014)
WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKET WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0015)
THAT IS A VERY FINE CHAP YOU HAVE HE SAID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0016)
SO IT WAS SAID ANDERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0017)
AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTING IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0018)
WITH ONE JUMP ANDERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAMBER	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0019)
HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS A YARD	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0020)
HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AND HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0021)
AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTH OPEN	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0022)
BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR THE KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0023)
ANDERS FACE GREW RED	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0024)
SO HIS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0025)
OH MY LITTLE SON SHE SAID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0026)
IF YOU WERE DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0027)
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENTERS OF THE COURT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0000)
HOW VERY WELL	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0001)
LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AU COURANT WITH THEIR CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0002)
GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT ANIGNON AND VILLEROIS TOOK THEIR LEAVE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0003)
CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WELL	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0004)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CONTINUED LOUISE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0005)
HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH WAS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0006)
IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT SHE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWNED	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0007)
DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER REMEMBER THE DISLOYAL ATTEMPT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0008)

YOU WOULD TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0011)
THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNINGS DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF COQUETRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0012)
THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILET BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN A OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0013)
THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON THE MAGNIFICENT DAIS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATRE OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0014)
EVIDENTLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PEACE AND ORDER SPRING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0015)
THE THOUSANDS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUADRILLE WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DANCE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0016)
HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLOURED SILKEN HOSE OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0017)
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BUOYANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEM TO SOAR	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0018)

THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCERS IN THE QUADRILLE CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0029)
EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION OF PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BEDIMMED	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0000)

SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR AT WHICH SHE WAS PRESENTLY GOING TO DANCE	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0007)
A ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM MORTALLY	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0008)

LET US RUN THEN SAID ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR SILVER DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE THICKEST COVERT OF THE PARK	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0038)

IN THIS WAY THE FETE OF THE COURT WAS A FETE ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER IN THE BRAKE THE PHEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX IN ITS HOLE WERE ALL LISTENING	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0040)
ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND GOLDEN COLOUR SCATTERED IN BROAD SPLASHES	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0000)
THE MERGANCER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF IRIDESCENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PENCILED IN BLACK AND WHITE AND BREAST OF RICH CHESTNUT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0001)
HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAWTOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0002)
BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS AND EAGLES WHO HAD NO RENDING CLAWS	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0003)
BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMORANT HE SHOT OUT INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0004)
ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FROM HIS PERCH	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0005)
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0006)
BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS ENGORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0007)
IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO MUCH	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0008)
THE GREAT HUNK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO RETRIEVE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0009)
THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE IN HER JAWS AND TROTTED IN THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0010)
IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM ON HIS STRAINED GULLET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0011)
THE HAWK ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND STOOD UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0012)
LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE ROOF OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0013)
THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCHES AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0014)
ALMOST INSTANTLY HE WAS FASTENED TO THE TOP	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0015)
STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK CLIMBED FROM HIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0016)
BUT AT THIS POINT THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0017)
BUT THIS FREQUENTER OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOUR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES IN THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0018)
AS HE THREW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0019)
WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING RANGE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0020)
BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOWER ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0021)
THE FOX EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0022)
HE HAD A LOT OF WINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CASTE BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0023)
THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT GOT JUST ON THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0024)
IN THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0025)
THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHICKEN UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0026)
WHEN THE LEADER PARTED FROM THE LINE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0027)
HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE TO THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO A SYMPOSIUM ON THE PRICE OF GOLF BALLS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0000)
IN SHORT HE BECOMES THE PROMINENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0001)
BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMATIST HAS HIS LIMITS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0002)
YOUR PLAY MUST BE NOT ONLY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0003)
AND FRANKLY I CANNOT ALWAYS SAY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0004)
BUT SUPPOSE YOU SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAID MY LETTERS HOME ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0005)
I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND THEN PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0006)
ANYHOW IT'S JOLLY EXCITING AND I CAN DO THE DIALOG ALL RIGHT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0007)
LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGE CROWD IS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0008)
THEN I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HOMILY ON SOLILOQUY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0009)
HIM BE OR NOT TO BE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0010)
NO THE OBJECT OF THIS SOLILOQUY IS PLAIN	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0011)
INDEED IRRESOLUTION BEING THE KEYNOTE OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER CAN TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEANING	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0012)
WE MODERNS ALWAYS SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0013)
IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STAGE TECHNIQUE HOW SHOULD A SOLILOQUY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0014)
AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN OPHELIA MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NONCOMITTAL OF THAT SORT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0015)
THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASILY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0016)
IN THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAYS IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0017)
IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS THEM WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0018)

THEN IS THE TIME TO INTRODUCE THE MEAL ON THE STAGE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0037)
A STAGE MEAL IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVES TO THE AUDIENCE THAT THE ACTORS EVEN WHEN CALLED CHARLES HOLTREE OR OWEN NOIRES ARE REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0038)

A SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STATES GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0002)
FOR GENERAL SERVICES THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN THE SCALE	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0003)

CAPTAIN MARTYN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORST	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0045)
IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINTH A COMPANY OF DRAGOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PRO SLAVERY MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIES TO LAKE COMPTON IN THE CHARGE OF OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0046)
THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROFESSION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0000)
AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF MURCHESSTONE SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0001)
WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY A VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0002)
THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSE'S COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE OF SCOTLAND	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0003)
FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCOT WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0004)
DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS RETURNING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLEY AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0005)
THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR MILITARY COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0006)
BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS AND GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0007)
WITH THESE AND SOME REINFORCEMENTS OF THE ATHOL MEN AND MACDONALDS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSE AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0008)
THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INNERLOCCI SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0009)
BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNERLOKI AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTENED COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0010)
HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE PROVED CONSPICUOUS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0011)
MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROYALIST	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0012)
FROM THE SAME END NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD RELY ON	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0013)
BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0014)
THOUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MOST EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0015)
VALOR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMED STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0016)
HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANYTHING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOUR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINED THE SUCCESS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0017)
HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARBOROUGH ON THE HILL	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0000)
THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE UPON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0001)
THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED HIM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0002)
HAS HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0003)
AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE GIVEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0004)
ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACES WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0005)
THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THIS PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0006)
HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN COULD ME DEVOUR	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0007)
THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE A GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0008)
THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAY THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0009)
BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS BUT HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0010)
THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILST THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0011)
IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCOR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0012)
HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS THE PUBLIC MISFORTUNE	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0013)
THIS ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0000)
WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP PERPETUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0001)
WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT IS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0002)
AND WHAT SORT OF DIFFERENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0003)
THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0004)
ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TANABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0005)
THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY AND MAKING THE RECORD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0006)
HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIORIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAS BEEN OTHER TIMES	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0007)
BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE WAS WARRANTED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0008)
OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTER OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0009)
WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAIN WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0010)
SOME MARRIAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0011)
FAMILIARITY IS A FEELING CAPABLE OF DEGREE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0012)
IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHILE THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0013)
I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MIGHT HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0014)
THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTION OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0015)
IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THAT FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0016)
THERE MIGHT BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0017)
THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A BELOVED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0018)
IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING EVENTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0019)
IF WE HAD RETAINED THAT SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0020)
REMEMBERING HAS TO BE THE PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0021)
SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS A THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0022)
IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT CAN BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0023)
THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0024)
WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMPEDIACY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0025)
THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW THE THEORY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0026)
A GRAMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS I LIKE TO BELIEVE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0027)
I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE LIVING HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0028)
THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0029)
SYMONDS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0030)
THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEFS THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0031)
IT IS ALL THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0032)
IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED AT SOME TIME	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0033)
WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO A JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0034)
THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELINGS OF FAMILIARITY ALONE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0035)
A FURTHER STAND IS RECOGNITION	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0036)
RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THAT MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTICS WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNISE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0037)
WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNISE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS OBJECT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0038)
THIS KNOWLEDGE IS A MEMORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0039)
THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0040)
THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONGST THE MOST IMPORTANT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0041)
THUS IF I RECOGNISED A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNISE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0042)
OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAD EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0043)
I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BOUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0000)
HAD EVA CRESWELL NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINGTON OVAL REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BUNNETT AND THE BAR KEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0001)
ON ARRIVING AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT MY SALON WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0002)

IT'LL BE SUCH A SATISFACTION	(8555-284449-8555-284449-0010)
THE GUARDS HAD A TERRIBLE STRUGGLE WITH THE GOAT THAT WAS LOOSE IN THE ROOM AND STILL WANTED TO FIGHT BUT FINALLY THEY SUBDUED THE ANIMAL AND THEN THEY TOOK THE BOOLOOROO OUT OF THE FRAME HE WAS TIED IN AND BROUGHT BOTH HIM AND THE GOAT BEFORE QUEEN TROT WHO AWAITED THEM IN THE THRONE ROOM OF THE PALACE	(8555-284449-8555-284449-0011)
