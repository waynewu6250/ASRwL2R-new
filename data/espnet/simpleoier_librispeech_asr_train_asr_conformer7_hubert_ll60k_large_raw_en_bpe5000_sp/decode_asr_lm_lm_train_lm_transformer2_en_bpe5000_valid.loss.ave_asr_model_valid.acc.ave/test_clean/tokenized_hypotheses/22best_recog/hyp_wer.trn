THE UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0003)
PRIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE ALL SLOW WAVES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0004)
WHOSE FEET ARE AS THE FEET OF LIGHTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0005)

SOON THE WHOLE TABLE WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0007)
THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INNOCENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0008)
ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK HATS AND HUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKEN	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0009)
BROTHER MACARDELL BROTHER KIOF	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0010)
THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN THEIR ELABORATE ADORATION	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0011)
IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIZE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0012)
IDLE AND EMBITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST THEIR OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0013)
THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN CHORD	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0014)
THINGS WAS IT THEIR COLOURS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0015)
THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTSS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NOMADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0016)
THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEY AND WOOD BEGIRT AND CITADELLED AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARSHALLED RACES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0017)
AGAIN AGAIN HERE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0018)
A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS COMING	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0019)
HELLO STEPHANOS HERE COME THE DAEDALUS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0020)

HE STOOD STILL IN DEFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BANTER WITH EASY	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0022)
IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORDLIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT HER PITIABLE NAKEDNESS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0023)
STEPHANO STEWARDLOS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0024)
A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOSTS OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAZE WRAPT CITY	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0025)
YOU'LL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITIAN HOLBEIN TURNER AND TINTORET IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0000)
THEY UNITE EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERRING TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS CHIOSCURUS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0001)
BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CUROSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLOURISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTIONS THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0002)
MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCES ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUE SIDE BY SIDE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0003)
SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXT WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0004)
IT IS THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOWERS IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPATIUS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0005)
THEN HE COMES UP TO THE BEAK OF IT	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0006)
THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK IS PUT BY THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GREY DEFINE THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0007)
FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND FOR A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0008)
NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS ENCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN A ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEY ARE GRADATED JUSTLY	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0009)
SO IN THIS VIGNETTE COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0010)
THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAT I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVORITE CHOICE IN THE TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0011)
IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORIST WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOUR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUE WAS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0012)
IT MUST REMEMBER IS ONE OR THE OTHER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0013)
DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL HAS AN EASY ONE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0014)
THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT SHOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0015)
THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0016)
THAT A SIGH IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0017)
IN ALL EARTHLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WOULD FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0018)
THE LARGE LETTERS CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0019)
BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK AND IMAGINATION	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0020)
IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND DIGNITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0021)
YOU MIGHT LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0022)
THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PAROQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM UP EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGING AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0023)
NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT IN MATTER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0024)
AND YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0025)
HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO IN THE PYTHON	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0026)
NOW HERE IT IS RAPHAEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0027)
WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNER'S GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUDS AND FIRE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0028)

EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF HOLBEIN OR DUROC	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0037)
BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT BY WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0038)

IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KITES FLY FALCONS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WARWORF AND THE GEAR EAGLE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0044)

BUT RECKONING TIME WHOSE MILLION ACCIDENTS CREEP IN TWIXT VOWS AND CHANGE DECREES OF KINGS TAM'S SACRED BEAUTY BLUNT THE SHARPEST INTENTS DIVERT STRONG MINDS TO THE COURSE OF ALTERING THINGS ALAS WHY FEARING OF TIME'S TYRANNY MIGHT I NOT THEN SAY NOW I LOVE YOU BEST WHEN I WAS CERTAIN O'ER IN CERTAINTY CROWNING THE PRESENT DOUBTING OF THE REST	(121-123859-121-123859-0002)

SO I RETURN REBUKED TO MY CONTENT AND GAIN BY ILL THRICE MORE THAN THAT I HAVE SPENT	(121-123859-121-123859-0004)
IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT DREW FROM DOUGLAS NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING A REPLY THAT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHAT I CALL ATTENTION	(121-127105-121-127105-0000)
SOME ONE ELSE TOLD A STORY NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WHICH I SAID HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING	(121-127105-121-127105-0001)
CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF INSTEAD OF ME HE SAW WHICH HE SPOKE OF	(121-127105-121-127105-0002)
THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROAN AT THIS AND MUCH REPROACH AFTER WHICH IN HIS PREOCCUPIED WAY HE REMAINED	(121-127105-121-127105-0003)
THE STORY'S TAKEN	(121-127105-121-127105-0004)
I COULD WRITE TO MY MAN AND ENCLOSE THE KEYS HE COULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FINDS IT	(121-127105-121-127105-0005)
THE OTHERS RESENTED THE POSTPONEMENT BUT IT WAS JUST HIS SCRUPLES THAT CHARMED ME	(121-127105-121-127105-0006)
TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT OH THANK GOD NO BUT IS THE RECORD YOURS	(121-127105-121-127105-0007)
HE HUNG BACK AGAIN A WOMAN'S	(121-127105-121-127105-0008)
SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THESE TWENTY DAYS	(121-127105-121-127105-0009)
SHE SET ME THE PAGES IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED	(121-127105-121-127105-0010)
SHE WAS A MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHATEVER	(121-127105-121-127105-0011)
IT WASN'T SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW HE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE	(121-127105-121-127105-0012)
YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FETCH ME	(121-127105-121-127105-0013)
YOU ARE ABOUT	(121-127105-121-127105-0014)
HE QUITTED HIS FIRE AND DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR	(121-127105-121-127105-0015)
PROBABLY NOT TILL THE SECOND PLACE	(121-127105-121-127105-0016)
IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL TAKE	(121-127105-121-127105-0017)
CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURES HAD BEEN FIXED	(121-127105-121-127105-0018)
MISSUS GRIFFIN HOWEVER SPREAD THE NEED FOR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT	(121-127105-121-127105-0019)

WHY IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHO HE WAS	(121-127105-121-127105-0022)
LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LONGER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE	(121-127105-121-127105-0023)
POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE RESPECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH	(121-127105-121-127105-0024)
THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED THEM UP	(121-127105-121-127105-0025)
THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE CASE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN	(121-127105-121-127105-0026)
HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED	(121-127105-121-127105-0027)
THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THERE HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME	(121-127105-121-127105-0028)
THEY WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY	(121-127105-121-127105-0029)
I DON'T ANTICIPATE THIS	(121-127105-121-127105-0030)
HE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS	(121-127105-121-127105-0031)
YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PERSON	(121-127105-121-127105-0032)
IT WAS THE BELIEF OF IT	(121-127105-121-127105-0033)
THAT SOUNDED DULL BUT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MAIN CONDITION WHICH WAS	(121-127105-121-127105-0034)
SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARD	(121-127105-121-127105-0035)
BUT WAS NOT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED	(121-127105-121-127105-0036)
HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE ENTHUSIASM THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0000)
GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS IN THAT SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0001)
YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE AND APPREHENSION	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0002)
THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLY ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0003)
THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DO NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0004)
HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE EARL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0005)
THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAYS OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0006)
HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF AN UNDUE SEVERITY	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0007)
MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN MERITS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0008)
AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HIS MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0009)
IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PIERRE WAS A HUMAN CHILD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0010)
BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT OTHERWISE DELUSIVE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0011)
BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELL LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0012)
PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTINE WORLD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0013)
PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0014)
IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD ONLY SPEAK AGAIN	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0015)
HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED A FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0000)
ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON OF THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0001)
AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATES	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0002)
THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER PROTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0003)
WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BLACK COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0004)
IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LOVE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0005)
THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE MAD IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0006)
BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO CAREFULLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0007)
COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD AT MEN	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0008)
BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPED HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0009)
SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED SO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0010)
IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THAT AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0011)
WE APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICED WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0012)
LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANTS A FREEBORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEAR SLAVE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0013)
YEA HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKELY A LEECH	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0014)
YE MAY NEVER SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0015)
WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED THIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIREST STATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0016)
ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0017)
LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTISPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING IN THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREAST PLATE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0018)
MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK IT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0019)
IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ALMOST HIDDEN BEHIND IT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0020)
PEARLIE ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0021)
BUT THE PROPRIETORS APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0022)
THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT A HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BULL	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0023)
PEARL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGIN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0024)
HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEE PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF WHITE BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0000)
HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AND A FLAT BRIM AND ALONG THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0001)
INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNEDOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0002)
FOR A LONG TIME HE HOPED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0003)
WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNC SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STEPPED UP THE PATH	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0004)
NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THIS THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0005)
AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE CHELIKINS THE PATH DIVIDED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0006)
HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO IS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0007)
ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD THAT THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0008)
THEN SHE STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0009)
UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMEN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0010)
I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO YOUR HOME	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0011)
WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PALACE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0012)
THAT YOU MUST BE OJO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0013)
OJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A BIG MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0014)
WERE TRAVELLING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0015)
THE WOMAN CEASED THOUGHTFUL	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0016)
AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A NEW LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0017)
IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SEE IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0018)
YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEATS THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOMBI THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0019)
THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CASE WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0020)
I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THIS MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0021)
BUT I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0022)
YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC EUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0023)
THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE GIRL IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0024)
I THINK I WILL SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGOLOTTE LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0025)
BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEALS OR WASH THE DISHES	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0026)
EVEN THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0027)
A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTHES ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0028)
SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND FIGURES ARE SO MIXED UP	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0029)
WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT INTO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLOURS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0030)
AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OZMA LIVES GREEN WAS THE POPULAR COLOUR	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0031)
I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TINY CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0032)
OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITHOUT WONDER	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0000)
MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE HER GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL THROUGHOUT	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0001)
THE FOOT OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0002)
THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN AT HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0003)
GOLD IS OF THE MOST COMMON MEDAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0004)
NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BLINDS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0005)
WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MIGOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0006)
SHE POURED INTO HIS DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0007)
I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE VENTURED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0008)

THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LARGE SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0008)
THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE BOOKS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0009)

YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SIR	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0025)
IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A MORE PRIVATE COURT MARTIAL	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0026)
NO SIR CERTAINLY NEITHER	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0027)
THERE WAS NO MAN NOW	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0028)
HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DESPAIR UPON BANNISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0029)

AND PUT HIS SHOES ON THE TABLE	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0043)
GLOVER SAID THE YOUNG MAN	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0044)
SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIM AT THIS VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0045)

IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH FOR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0049)
IF MISTER SOLMES SAW HER THE GAME WAS UP	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0050)
IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENSE OF THE SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0000)
THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF HER DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLEANS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0001)
JOHN TAYLOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGHOUT COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTON	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0002)
BETTER GO HE HAD COUNSELLED SENTENTIOUSLY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0003)

AT ANY RATE I SAY GO IT	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0010)
HERE SHE WAS TOUCHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODOURS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0011)
SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THEIR NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0012)
SO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TO DAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE AUTUMNS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0013)
THE COTTON SHE PAUSED	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0014)
SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TOUCH AND IN SIGHT	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0015)
THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO NORTHWARD	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0016)
THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT THE MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0017)
HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND HE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0018)
COTTONS IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0019)
MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARK SEEMED CALLED FOR	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0020)
DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LIT'ERLY BORN IN COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0021)

GOOBLES DON'T GROW ON DE TOPS OF VINES BUT ON DE GROUND AN DE ROOTS LIKE YAMS IS THAT SO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0023)
THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE I HEARKENED	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0024)
SOMETIME YOU'LL TELL ME PLEASE WOULDN'T YOU	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0025)
NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT AND SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTON	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0026)
THE HON CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLEIGH'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0000)
AT LAST THE COTTON COMBING WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0001)
WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS ANOTHER MEN	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0002)
SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCES IN OTHERS	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0003)
AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESTS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TONIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CRICHTON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CRICHTON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0004)
MISSUS GREY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECTS SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0005)
SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRIZED TO HEAR MISTER CRESWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0006)
DO YOU BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARGARET TAYLOR	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0007)
I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDING HIM	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0008)
BUT CRESWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0009)
THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GRAY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMS TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0010)
IS POSITIVELY HEROIC ADDED CRESWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0011)
BUT WE'RE NOT AS EXACTLY WELCOME	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0012)
MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZARA TO MISSUS GREY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0013)
FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING IN A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0014)

IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE CANNON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT ROUND IT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0001)
SEE THE SWAMP THE CRUEL SWAMP	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0002)
THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING DOUBT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0003)
HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND DID NOT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0004)
SHE WAS SO STRANGE BUT HUMAN A CREATURE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0005)
THE WORLD WAS ALL WATER VEILED IN MISTS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0006)
THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MID DAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STEAMING	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0007)
WHERE WAS THE USES OF IMAGINING	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0008)
THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THEIR DIKES A WEEK AGO AND NOW	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0009)
PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEEPINGLY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0010)
HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT BUT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0011)
HE SPLASHED AND STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BENCH	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0012)
AS HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0013)
SHE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0014)
THE SQUARES OF COTTONS SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BOWLS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0015)
FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANING DIZZILY AGAINST THE TREE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0016)
HE GAZED ABOUT A PERPLEXED ASTONISHED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0017)
HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAINS EVERY ONE HAD DUG A CANAL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0018)
HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST OF SARAH	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0019)
THE YEARS OF THESE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0020)
THE HOPE OF DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0021)
UP IN THE SICK ROOM ZORA LAY ON LITTLE WHITE BED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0022)
THE NET AND WEBS OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0023)
FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AND SUN AND BIRD AND TREE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0024)
SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE WOOD AND INTO THE SWAMP	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0025)
SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDER SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MADE HER LOVE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0026)
ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LO THE GOLDEN LAY BEFORE HER	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0027)
THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE DID	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0028)
IT DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0029)
IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIME STONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOORPLACE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0000)
FOR THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0001)
FOR IT HAS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0002)
A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BANKS	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0003)
AND WHAT THOUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0004)
SEVERAL CLOTHES HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPENED AND STUFFED FULL OF COLOURED RAGS	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0005)
AT THE EDGE OF THIS BASIN THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0006)
THE HISTORY OF MY HOUSE IS PLAIN NOW	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0007)
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF FADED GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0008)

HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SURFACES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR ON THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0010)
DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN THREE AND THIRTY OF FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHT FOOTED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0011)
THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS FROM THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0012)
HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKE UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0013)
THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WITHDOWS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0014)
TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND THEN CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0015)

DID EVER ANYTHING SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0029)
TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK THAT MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0030)
AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO AUNT PRISCILLA	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0031)
I OFTEN HEARD THEM TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0032)
WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAD A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0033)

SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH GREAT STATELY CORDIALITY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0044)
OH SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYS	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0045)

SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE THROUGH THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0048)
NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSITOR TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOOL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0049)
BUT THERE'S FATHER IN THE BARNS SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0050)
NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WHELPS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR FATHER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0051)
I MIGHT COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0052)
FOR IF IT'S ANYWHERE ON THE FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0053)
OH SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULD N'T LIKE IT AT ALL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0054)
OR YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO SIR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0055)
I KNEW I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0056)
I KNOW HIS FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS TO THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0057)
BY THE BYE I'M NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY MISSUS POYSER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0058)
THIS MISSUS POYSER SAYS BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0059)
OH I'VE NO DOUBT HE'S IN CAPITAL ORDER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0060)
THE PARIS PLANT LIKE THAT AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY HABIT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0000)
THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPORTING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0001)
THERE MESSRS JOHNSON AND HAMPER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0002)
THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0003)
OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATED CURRENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0004)
WHY IF WE ERECT A STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP FROM THE CITY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0005)
THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL STAND	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0006)
BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0007)
EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE EXTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0008)
FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS BUT THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0009)
IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR DID IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0010)
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARM HOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND WAS IDEAL	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0011)
EDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND ALVANOMETER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0012)
UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FROM HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0013)
MISTER EDISON WAS A LIEUTENANT FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0014)
HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALSO THE REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0015)
THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE THE ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0016)
EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK OF THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0017)
HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TEMPORARY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0018)
THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WINE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0019)
IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A CHOICE PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0020)
THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0021)
MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS OF PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0022)
I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE BUT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0023)
BUT THE PLANT RAN AND THERE WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0024)
THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF EDISONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0025)
THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MUST BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0026)
EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A MEDIUM	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0027)
THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHEN OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0028)
HENCE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTE METRE IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0029)
THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METER IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE THE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0030)
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERINGS AS WOULD PROMOTE THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0031)
THE STANDARD EDISON METER PRACTICES WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0032)
IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME IN THE METRE THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0033)
THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A PROVIDEND BASIS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0034)
IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY ME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0035)
THE METRE CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0036)
HE WEIGHED AND RE WEIGHED THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLY BUT ALL IN VAIN	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0037)
HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS THE KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0038)
THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED TO	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0039)
YOU WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0040)
WE HAD METRES ON WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0041)
HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST CAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME	(237-126133-237-126133-0000)
EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SAVED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS	(237-126133-237-126133-0001)
THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITMAN YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS	(237-126133-237-126133-0002)
SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER	(237-126133-237-126133-0003)

ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDED UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE	(237-126133-237-126133-0014)
YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHINGS HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE	(237-126133-237-126133-0015)
OH NO JAPS SIR I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF	(237-126133-237-126133-0016)
THE JAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE	(237-126133-237-126133-0017)
DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER IT WASN'T HER FAULT	(237-126133-237-126133-0018)
DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS WE'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO	(237-126133-237-126133-0019)
NOW DID HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO	(237-126133-237-126133-0020)
SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T SUPPOSE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER	(237-126133-237-126133-0021)
I DIDN'T HAVE MANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY	(237-126133-237-126133-0022)
HE ASKED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY	(237-126133-237-126133-0023)
AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT AND HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME	(237-126133-237-126133-0024)
AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF HER AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY	(237-126133-237-126133-0025)

I SHALL NEVER GET YOU TWENTY AT THAT RATE	(260-123440-260-123440-0009)
HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN A GENTLY SMILING JAWS	(260-123440-260-123440-0010)
NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND UPON IT IF I'M MABEL I'LL STAY DOWN HERE	(260-123440-260-123440-0011)
IT'LL BE NO USE MY PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME UP AGAIN DEAR	(260-123440-260-123440-0012)
I AM TOO VERY TIRED OF BEING ALL ALONE HERE	(260-123440-260-123440-0013)
AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD AND IT IS	(260-123440-260-123440-0014)
I WISH I HADN'T WORRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT	(260-123440-260-123440-0015)
I MUST BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN TEARS	(260-123440-260-123440-0016)

I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE OF MOUSE	(260-123440-260-123440-0018)
CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY FONDED	(260-123440-260-123440-0019)
WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE I INDEED	(260-123440-260-123440-0020)
WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THAT GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0000)
THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAM LIKE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TODAY TO AMERICANS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0001)
LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON THELLATIONS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0002)
THE UNDERTAKING WHICH APPEARED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0003)
IT WAS WRITTEN IN HER LATIN	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0004)
THE WORKERS HAD TO BE CONDENSED	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0005)
A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ONGLLATIONS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0006)
MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTOR MY GELLATIONS FOR INSTANCE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0007)
IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND ROSER PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0008)
IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY A JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0009)
BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IT IS THERE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0010)
THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE TEN	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0011)
THE WORD OF HER GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0012)
IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PETER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0000)
THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF THOU	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0001)
WHO WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0002)
PAUL CAME LATER AND IS BENEATH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0003)
INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONGER TIME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0004)

AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFEATS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY AND MINISTRY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0006)
AS THE AMBASSADOR OF THAT GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0007)
PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE NOT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0008)
PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN HET CETERA	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0009)
EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HIS CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0010)
PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED FOR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0011)
THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY ANOTHER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0012)
HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES THE FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0013)
THE CAT IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0014)
FOR A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT NOTHING	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0015)
IT FAILS ONE'S BEST WORK	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0016)
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CLAIM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0017)
WE DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0018)
I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD IT SPIRITUAL BOASTING	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0019)
THIS HAS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS HOLY PRIDE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0020)
THE GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0021)
THE CLAGUE SEEMED SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0022)
THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST ASSIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0023)
IN A WHOLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0024)
BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL BREATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0025)
FIRST TWO A	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0026)
AND ALL THE BRETHREN WHICH ARE IN ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0027)
THIS CAN GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0028)
ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE TEACH AS I DO	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0029)
THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CRITICS ARE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0030)
WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH OUR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0031)
WE WILL LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0032)
NOT ALL OF THE GALATIONS HAD BECOME PERVERTED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0033)
THESE EVENTS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0034)
THEY REMAINED A DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0035)
WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST RANKS THERE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0036)
SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE CHRIST THREE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0037)
GRACE HE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0038)
THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND WERE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0039)
THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS VERY REFRESHING	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0040)
THEIR GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0041)
THAT WORLD BRANDS THIS A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0042)
YOUR EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0043)
HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL DO	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0044)
MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THAT NATURE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0045)
WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAVE FROM GOD THEIR FATHER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0046)
TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALL BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0047)
HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTENS UPON HIM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0048)
EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE ANGEL OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0049)
DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAYS AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0050)
WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BECOME AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0051)
WE ARE TO USE CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0052)
AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GLAD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0053)
THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND GRACE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0054)
TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE CONFIDENCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0055)
OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD AND FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0056)
THE ARIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE ON HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0057)
MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS OF CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0058)
PAUL STICKS AT HIS THEME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0059)
HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLING	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0060)
NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASCHAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT WHAT FOR	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0061)
NOT FOR A CROWN FOR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0062)
AND UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0063)
HOW MAY HE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0064)
PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD MADE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0065)
SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0066)
THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SONS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0067)
THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THESE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0068)
THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR YOUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0069)
THAT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0070)
WE THINK THAT BY SUCH LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0071)
THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOUGHT UNDER SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0072)
THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY KNOW THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0073)
THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND INVARIABLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0074)
FOR THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0075)
ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO HORRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0076)
HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MEN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECTS FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE	(2961-960-2961-960-0000)
THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE TIMAEUS WAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING	(2961-960-2961-960-0001)
IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEO PLATONISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CONNECTIONS IN THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO	(2961-960-2961-960-0002)
THEY ARE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL	(2961-960-2961-960-0003)
THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEOPATONISTS	(2961-960-2961-960-0004)
IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THIS CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT	(2961-960-2961-960-0005)
THE FANCIES OF THE NEOPLATINISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND WAS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY	(2961-960-2961-960-0006)
BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN A SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM	(2961-960-2961-960-0007)
WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF EM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY PRESENTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND	(2961-960-2961-960-0008)
THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDED UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS	(2961-960-2961-960-0009)
BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE WORLD	(2961-960-2961-960-0010)
WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE ANEXAGORAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBERS	(2961-960-2961-960-0011)
MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY WERE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS	(2961-960-2961-960-0012)
IT IS PROBABLE THAT A RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE	(2961-960-2961-960-0013)
THESE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES	(2961-960-2961-960-0014)
THE STYLE AND PLANE OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES	(2961-960-2961-960-0015)
BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PHAEDROS OR SYMPOSIUM	(2961-960-2961-960-0016)
NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ARTS OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER	(2961-960-2961-960-0017)
BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND A DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP	(2961-960-2961-960-0018)
HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE WAS NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA	(2961-960-2961-960-0019)
AND HERE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERISES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS	(2961-960-2961-960-0020)
THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF THE REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIER WRITINGS	(2961-960-2961-960-0021)
PLATO HAD NOW THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART	(2961-960-2961-960-0022)
SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPORT	(2961-961-2961-961-0000)
AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE AN IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE	(2961-961-2961-961-0001)
AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIAS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNEW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE	(2961-961-2961-961-0002)
I WILL IF TIMAEUS APPROVES I PREFER	(2961-961-2961-961-0003)
LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SALENS WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF TROPIDUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIUS AND HE TOLD ME	(2961-961-2961-961-0004)
SOME POEMS OF SALONS WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS	(2961-961-2961-961-0005)
AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEM SAID THE PERSON WHO HAD MADE THE REMARK	(2961-961-2961-961-0006)
THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED	(2961-961-2961-961-0007)
BUT THE MEMORY OF THESE EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS	(2961-961-2961-961-0008)
TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SALDEN HEARD THE STORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0009)
BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER ISLANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES	(2961-961-2961-961-0010)
THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNALS ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORIES	(2961-961-2961-961-0011)
FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FEET OF HEAVEN	(2961-961-2961-961-0012)
SELLING MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS	(2961-961-2961-961-0013)
NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AN EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED OURS AS OUR ANNALS RECORD	(2961-961-2961-961-0014)
MANY STATES EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME	(2961-961-2961-961-0015)
I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURES IN THE SACRED REGISTERS	(2961-961-2961-961-0016)
OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE THE LAW TOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND SUPPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN	(2961-961-2961-961-0017)
THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW IN THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS	(2961-961-2961-961-0018)
FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND THEN THE OTHER HELLENES HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS	(2961-961-2961-961-0019)
THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC	(2961-961-2961-961-0020)
BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I PROMISED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0021)
THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN SISTERS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORDS SPOKE	(2961-961-2961-961-0022)
BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN THE MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0000)
THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE RESULT	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0001)
SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THE WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULNESS OF LIFE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0002)
WITH THE FURTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS TABOO MAY CHANGE TO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABOO OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0003)
IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE PROFITS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEISURE CLASS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0004)
OF THE TABOO CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0005)
DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURNS TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0006)
IT HAS OFTEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERY DAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0007)
THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE PROFIT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0008)
WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH ALL QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0009)
THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF AND EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0010)
THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY OR RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0011)
THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK AT GRATES	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0012)
THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED WITH THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0013)
MANY OF THEM AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0014)
SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRONS MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0015)
MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMERS IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0016)
THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE BUT A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0017)
THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES WILL BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0018)
BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERWHELMED	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0019)
SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE OPEN SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0020)
WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THAT MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONORIFIC CHARACTER	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0021)
THEN LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0022)
IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NEW CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0000)
THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FROM THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0001)
BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHILE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0002)
IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURES THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0003)
IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORTS	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0004)
THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS OR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0005)
VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET AND THE LAST PRETENSE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0006)
THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF HIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0007)
THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY TEACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0008)
EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE HIGHER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0009)
THE MORAL ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0010)
IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF HIS DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0011)
IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION GREATEST	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0012)
CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THIS STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0013)
AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION HIS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEIGHBOURHOOD GOSSIPS SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0014)
THIS RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0015)
UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE EXCLUSIVE CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0000)
BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE CORSAL PEACEABLE CULTURE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0001)
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND OF WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0002)

THEY ARE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE OUR COUSINS	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0003)
WHATEVER LORD CHELFORD SAID MISS BRANDON REPEATED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0004)

AT NIGHT LAKE WAS EASY AND AMUSING	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0006)

I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING OVER	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0010)
WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH A SLY EYES	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0011)
AND WYLDER LAUGHED TOO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOUR OF THE JOKE SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES ON LEAR BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DOROTHY ONLY REMARKING	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0012)

OH I KNOW THAT'S LURN BRANDON	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0016)
ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LEAKE	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0017)
MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE THAT NIGHT	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0000)
AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTATORY	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0001)
BUT DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN UP VERY FOOLISHLY	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0002)
IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORMED A LITTLE IDEA OF HER	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0003)

AS HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CANE TOWARDS BRANDON HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0005)
YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORST	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0006)
IF A FELLOW'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT WHILE HE'S BEELZEBUB AT ONCE	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0007)
PRACTON'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0008)
I DON'T KNOW AND CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FINE GENTLEMEN DEFINE WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMALE I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LIGHTS AND SHE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0009)

THEIR WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHAEL AT LAST	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0011)
NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE RADLY FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING	(5683-32866-5683-32866-0012)

BUT THE TREE DID NOT REJOICE AT ALL HE GREW AND GREW AND WAS GREEN BOTH WATER AND SUMMER	(672-122797-672-122797-0020)
AND TOWARDS CHRISTMAS SHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS CUT DOWN	(672-122797-672-122797-0021)
THE AXE STRUCK DEEP INTO THE VERY PITH THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANG IT WAS LIKE A SWOON HE DID NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPRUNG UP	(672-122797-672-122797-0022)
HE WELL KNEW THAT HE MUST NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANY MORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS	(672-122797-672-122797-0023)
THE DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AMIABLE	(672-122797-672-122797-0024)
THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND I HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS	(672-122797-672-122797-0025)
THERE TOO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WORTH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SO	(672-122797-672-122797-0026)
THE SERVANTS AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LADIES DECORATED HIM	(672-122797-672-122797-0027)

IT BLAZED UP FAMOUSLY HELPED	(672-122797-672-122797-0031)
CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THAT FIRE	(672-122797-672-122797-0032)
ITS STORY	(672-122797-672-122797-0033)
A STONE CRIED THE CHILDREN DRAWING A LITTLE FAT MAN TOWARDS THE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0034)
BUT I SHALL SEE ONLY ONE STORY	(672-122797-672-122797-0035)
HUMPY DUMPY FELL DOWNS AND YET HE MARRIED THE PRINCESS	(672-122797-672-122797-0036)
THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLDS	(672-122797-672-122797-0037)
THOUGHT THE FIR TREE AND BELIEVED IT ALL BECAUSE THE MAN WHO TOLD HER STORY WAS SO GOOD LOOKING WELL WELL	(672-122797-672-122797-0038)
I WON'T TREMBLE TO REMEMBER THOUGHT THE FIR TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0039)
AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE QUEEN STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT	(672-122797-672-122797-0040)
IN THE MORNING THE SERVANT AND THE HOUSEMAID CAME ON	(672-122797-672-122797-0041)
BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN THAT DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM	(672-122797-672-122797-0042)
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT OF TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0043)
AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALLS LOST IN REVERY	(672-122797-672-122797-0044)
TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST HE DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY	(672-122797-672-122797-0045)
TIS NOW WINTER OUT OF DOORS THOUGHT THE TRAIN	(672-122797-672-122797-0046)
HOW THE KIND MAN IS AFTER ALL	(672-122797-672-122797-0047)

SQUEAK SQUEAKING	(672-122797-672-122797-0049)
SHE SNUFFED ABOUT THE FIR TREE AND RUSTLED AMONG THE BRANCHES	(672-122797-672-122797-0050)
I AM BY NO MEANS OLD SAID THE FIR TREE AND	(672-122797-672-122797-0051)
THERE'S MANY A ONE CONSIDERABLY TALLER THAN I AM	(672-122797-672-122797-0052)
THEY WERE SO TERRIBLY CURIOUS	(672-122797-672-122797-0053)
I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE KING	(672-122797-672-122797-0054)
AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LISTENED AND SPOKE	(672-122797-672-122797-0055)
SAID THE FIR TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF LEARNED	(672-122797-672-122797-0056)
YES IN REALITY THOSE WERE THE HAPPY TIMES	(672-122797-672-122797-0057)
WHO IT IS HUMPY DUMPY ASKED THE MICE	(672-122797-672-122797-0058)
ONLY THAT ONE SAID THE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0059)
IT IS A VERY STUPID STORY AND	(672-122797-672-122797-0060)
DON'T YOU KNOW THE ONE ABOUT BACON AND TALLOW CANDLES CAN'T YOU TELL ANY LARDER STORIES	(672-122797-672-122797-0061)
NO SAID THE OTHER	(672-122797-672-122797-0062)
BUT GOOD BYE SAID THE RATS AND THEY WENT HOME	(672-122797-672-122797-0063)
AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALSO AND THE TREE SIGHED AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN THE SLEEK LITTLE MICE SET ROUND ME AND LISTENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM	(672-122797-672-122797-0064)
NOW THE TOO IS OVER	(672-122797-672-122797-0065)
I ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT	(672-122797-672-122797-0066)
THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHTS SHONE	(672-122797-672-122797-0067)
BUT IT WAS NOT THE FIR TREE THAT SHE MEANT	(672-122797-672-122797-0068)
IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG WEEDS AND NETTLES AND	(672-122797-672-122797-0069)
THE GOLDEN STAR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THIS TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE	(672-122797-672-122797-0070)
IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MERRIAD CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT SIGHT OF HIM	(672-122797-672-122797-0071)
AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THAT WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE	(672-122797-672-122797-0072)
THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE HUGE BREWING COPPER AND IT SIGHED SO DEEPLY	(672-122797-672-122797-0073)
HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE THE STORM AT AN END	(672-122797-672-122797-0074)
KENNETH AND BETH REFRAINED FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGERS'S VISIT BUT THEY KEPT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORGING A CHECK	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0000)
IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SAVE A LENGTHY TERM IN THE STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0001)
I CAN'T SEE HER IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0002)
IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO DETECT A GIRL HE LOVED	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0003)
BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE IS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0004)
HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T START TO COUNT THE COST	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0005)
IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGED CHEQUE THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0006)
OR UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0007)
FAIRVIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY AND BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY DRAIL	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0008)
THEY WERE RECEIVED IN HIS LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0009)
WE WISH TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWERED KENNETH DARK	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0010)

MAY WE SEE ITS GATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0013)
THEN FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG A SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0014)
SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARNING FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORTH DRYIN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0015)
HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HERE'S VISITORS SIR	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0016)
WORSE TOM WORSE'N EVER WAS REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0017)
MISS DU GRAF SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0018)
SORRY WE HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE BAIL	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0019)
SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID GATES IN A CORDIAL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A BENCH HERE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0020)
A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING GIRL WAS TOM GATES WITH STEADY GRAY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0021)
WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORIES SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0022)
I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID THAT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0023)
OLD WILL IS A NICE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0024)
THEN ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEAD HER ABOUT AND WAIT ON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0025)
HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW HALL IN FRONT OF THEM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0026)
WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO HER CHEQUE ASKED KENNETH	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0027)
HE IS DISPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERN	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0028)
IT'S A STOCK COMPANY ATRICH	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0029)
I WAS A BIG KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHEQUE AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0030)
AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED IT A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0031)
I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARSHALL NEVER YET THANKED ME	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0032)
IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UNFEELINGLY THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0033)
I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAID KENNETH AND TO DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0034)
IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT I'M LIKE TO FIND A FRIEND	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0035)
THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO HIS OFFICE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0036)
BUT I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN MY DAY	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0037)
AND IT RUINS A MAN'S PROPOSITION	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0038)
HE LOOKED UP ALMOST UNGRACIOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0039)
SOME GIRL HAS BEEN IN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I'VE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0040)
I'M NOT ELECTIONEERING JUST NOW AND	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0041)
OH WELL DEAR WHAT ABOUT HIM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0042)
AND YOU DESERVES A TERM IN STATE'S PRISON	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0043)
IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIX DOLLARS AN ANNOYANCE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0044)
I'LL PAY ALL THE COSTS BEHIND	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0045)
YOU'RE FOOLISH WHAT SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0046)
I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHAL	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0047)
GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGED CHECK AND QUASH FURTHER PROCEEDS	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0048)
HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATEES	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0049)
TO BETH UNEASY AT HIS SILENCE NUDGED HIM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0050)
THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON ITS SHREWD FACE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0051)
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHEST FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0052)
AND YOU THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0053)
SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORD'S AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS WOULD BE NECESSARY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0000)
ONE OF MISTER HOPKIN'S FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMEN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVASS OF THE VOTERS OF THIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0001)
THE WEAK NEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF THOUSAND VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM OPPOSITION	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0002)
THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED IT OUT A WAY TO DO THIS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0003)
UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS REYNOLDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMUNITY PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPKINS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0004)
THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH REYNOLDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED TO PERSONALLY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0005)
AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN AT THE BUGGY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0006)
THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF A COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0007)
THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND I PROMISED TO ASSIST IN ELECTING MISTER FORBES	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0008)
LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THE ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0009)
THE FAIRVIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PROVE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESTS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0010)
TABLES WERE SPREAD AT THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIAL REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0011)
THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN FOR THE NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESTS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0012)
THE ATTENDANCE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FORESEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHTS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0013)
WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTENTION TO BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0014)
WOULDN'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0015)
SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS THE ESPECIAL FAVOURITE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0016)
THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BEN FOLLOWED	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0017)
FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND A SAD SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0018)
SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST THE PLAIN BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0019)
THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I'M MISS ELIZABETH PARSONS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0020)
BUT IT CAN'T BE PROTECTED THE GIRL	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0021)
I ATTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD MENDING YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR THE LINENS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0022)
YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE IS HIS HOME	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0023)
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HIS GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITOR	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0024)
SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROCKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BERT	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0025)
THEN ELIZA PARSONS SHOOK HER HEAD	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0026)
THEY THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I CAN'T BEAR IT YOU MUST EXCUSE ME	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0027)
I EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0028)
BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR EVEN ELIZA SURPASSED HER IN NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0029)
THEIR MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0030)
HER EYES WANDERED TO A MAID'S HANDS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0031)
HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORM WOULD REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0032)
SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH HER DRESS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0033)
I WISH I KNEW YOURSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0034)
WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ASK YOU	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0035)
ELIZA CLOSED HER DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0036)
CONCORD WENT TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TENTS	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0000)
THE ENGLISH FOIGHTED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0001)
CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS EVERYWHERE DURING A JOURNEY	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0002)
FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UNHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCIS	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0003)
SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR HIM THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPENED FOR THEM	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0004)
THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON ITS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0005)
THIS HAS INDEED BEEN A HARASSING TIME CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0006)
YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS WAS	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0007)
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHY BUCKINGHAME HAS BEEN SO VIOLENT I SUSPECT	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0008)
IT IS YOU WHO ARE MISTAKEN RAOUL I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACCENT THE WHOLE DAY	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0009)
I CAN PERCEIVE A LOVE CLEARLY ENOUGH	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0010)
I AM CONVINCED OF WHATEVER I SAY SAID THE COUNT	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0011)
IT IS ANNOYANCE BUT	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0012)
IN THOSE VERY TERMS I EVEN ADMITTED MORE	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0013)
BUT CONTINUED RAOUL NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE HEARTLESS AND INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0014)
THUS IT IS THAT THE FATHER OF THREE IS SAVED OUR COUNTRY OUR MASTERS AND OUR OWN	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0015)
YES I NEED REPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THIS SAME MAN	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0016)
BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE RAWE COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0017)
THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLIT AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY SOMEWHERE	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0018)
UPON THIS LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGSTONES	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0019)
BRAGELONNE WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVIL SLUMBERS OF THE MANI KEMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0020)
GOLIATH MAKES ANOTHER VICTORY	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0000)
THEY WERE CERTAINLY NO NEARER TO THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0001)
THE DEAR LITTLE THINGS CRIED CYNTHIA THINK OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0002)
NOW WHAT IS THE NAME OF IT TWO INNOCENT BABIES LIKE THAT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0003)
BUT BOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT DOWN HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACED HER COMPANION	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0004)
THE TWIN BROTHER DID ANYTHING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICTURE TO THE WALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0005)
HERS HAPPENED TO BE ON THE SAME FRAME TOO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DIDNT CARE ABOUT IT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0006)
NOW THEN WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHIA SPRAGUE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0007)
I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMPED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE BUT IT'VE BEEN OF SOME USE AFTER ALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0008)
DO YOU SUPPOSE THEIR MINIATURE WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0009)
WHAT IN THE WORLD ISS IT QUERIED JOYCE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0010)
YOU'LL WORRY ME TERRIBLY AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEME SIN	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0011)
WE'LL COME IN HERE THAT AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOTHES ON AND HAVE A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0012)
IT CAN'T HURT ANYTHING I'M SURE OR WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0013)
THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC THREE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0014)
SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PARAPHERNALIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUST CAN TO THE OUTFIT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0015)
THE LURE PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A YOUNG KITTEN MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0016)
OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE URGED I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLDHOUSE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0017)
THEY MAKES IT SORT OF COSIER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0018)
OH LET'S DUST THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0019)
YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF A ROOM	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0020)
SURFACE DUST AT LENGTH HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0021)
THEN SHE SUDDENLY ARRIVED	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0022)
AND THEN MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0023)
THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLE LIGHT HAS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0024)
WHY THAT'S GOLIATH AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING IN	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0025)
IS N'T HE THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO ODD CORNERS	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0026)
FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND SCURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON AN OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0027)
WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0028)
NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY NOT IN REALITY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0000)
I HEARD A NOISE BEYOND I TURNED AND SAW KAFIR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0001)
ON WHICH SAID A DISTANT VOICE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0002)
NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE EVENING	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0003)
THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED IF THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0004)
WHAT WAS THAT IT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0005)
BUT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEAR DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0006)
NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE RISKS TO WHICH IT MAY BE ATTACHED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0007)
THAT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0008)
I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM AND GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS KAFIR	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0009)
A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT A	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0010)
A FEELING OF FREEDOM WHEN I WAS AWAKE WHERE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0011)
SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNISE AS VOLTAIRE'S KAFIR	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0012)
I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THE TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0013)
IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND WHICH WAS ALSO DISCOLOURED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0014)
I DO NOT SEE I AM DAZED BEWILDERED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0015)
BUT THAT IS KAPIR'S KNIFE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0016)
I KNOW HE HAD IT THE VERY EVENING	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0017)
I REMEMBERED SAYING HAVE WE NOT TOGETHER	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0018)
VOLTAIRE PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT HER	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0019)
I SAY YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0020)
A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO YOUR MIND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0021)
I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S PASSION	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0022)
PERCHANCE TOO KABIR'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0023)
IF MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEFT ME	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0024)
MY POSITION WAS TOO TRAGIC	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0025)
MY OVERWROUGHTED NERVES YIELDED AT LAST	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0026)
FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I RECOVERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0027)
THE REAL MODES OF MANAGEMENT	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0000)
TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKEN ITS NATURE AND DESIGN	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0001)
WHY REASON AND AFFECTION	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0002)
AS THE CHAISE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE MASTER DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT AND VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPENDS DOING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0003)
THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHAISE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY MAY NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0004)
SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WE WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0005)
THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE WISDOM OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0006)
IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD BOY BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0007)
BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNCERTAIN FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0008)
IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THE REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTIONS CANNOT BE OVERRATED	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0009)
TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILLS OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0000)
DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A SON WHOSE NAME WAS JANE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0001)
NOW DALIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0002)
TO GIVE SOME IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0003)
YOU HAVE COME ANDELLA AND CLELLA WAS THE NAME OF JANE'S DOLL TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0004)
I AM SO VERY GLAD	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0005)
I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL ANDELLA SINCE YOU WERE LAST	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0006)
THEN TURNING TO JEAN SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0007)
FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THEIR THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0008)
THEY WERE THEN PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOR	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0009)
DELIA CAME TO THE PARLOUR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSALIE HEAR AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0010)
SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWING BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0011)
SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHINGS SEE I	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0012)
PUT THESE PLAYTHINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND I WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0013)
BUT THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0014)
NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED ON EARLY IMPRESSIONS	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0000)
THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING AND	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0001)
THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE ON CHILDHOOD	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0002)
VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHED	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0003)
WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREMES AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0004)
THIS PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0005)
BUT THEERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0000)
HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ASERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0001)
HE WAS SUCH A BIG BODY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKKNIFE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0002)
NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE WAS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKKNIFE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0003)
YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDER	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0004)
SEEING THAT I AM SO TIRED I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0005)
I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED HENRYS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0006)
AND SHE TOOK ANDER'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEPS AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0007)
FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0008)
AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LITTLE ROWS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0009)
ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES OF RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0010)
THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET ANDAS SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0011)
BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND HE WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0012)
THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAPS WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0013)
HE ONLY SHOOK A HEAD	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0014)
WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN A HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0015)
THAT IS A VERY FINE CHARACTER YOU HAVE HE SAID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0016)
SO IT IS SAID ANDRESS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0017)
AND THIS IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0018)
WITH ONE JUMP ANDERS GOT OUT OF ITS CHAIR	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0019)
HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS AND DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0020)
HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MASTER'S COTTAGE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0021)
BUT ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0022)
BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT WITHERS WAS A STUPID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0023)
ANDER'S FACE GREW	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0024)
BUT HIS MOTHER HUGGED IT CLOSE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0025)
NO MY LITTLE WIFE SHE SAID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0026)
IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN ON YOUR LITTLE RED CAP	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0027)
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAS COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0000)
NOW VERY WELL	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0001)
LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AU COURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED SO SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0002)
GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT ANAGON AND VILLEROIS TOOK THEIR LEAVE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0003)
CERTAIN SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHAT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0004)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I INQUIRED LOUISE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0005)
HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO LIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0006)
IT'S NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWNED	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0007)
DOES MY MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYAL ATTEMPT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0008)
NO AT ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0009)
YOUR MAJESTY'S PLAN THEN FOR THIS AFFAIR IS	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0010)
YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY FAVOURITE TREASURE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0011)

IN THIS WAY THE FETE OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FETE ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER IN THE BRAKE THE PHEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX AT ITS HOLE WERE ALL LISTENING	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0040)
ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF WHITE AND BROKEN COLOR SCATTERED IN BROAD SPLASHES	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0000)
THE MERGANCER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF IRIDESCENT GREEN BACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PENCILLED IN BLACK AND WHITE AND A BREAST OF RICH CHESTNUT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0001)
HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW TOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BROWN RED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0002)
BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NOT RENDING CLAWS	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0003)
BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMORANT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BELOW THE SURFACE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0004)
ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR THE PERCH	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0005)
IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE HAD A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0006)
BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS ENGORGED VICTOR WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0007)
IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO OFTEN	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0008)
THE GREAT HULK FOLLOWED FURIOUSLY TO RETRIEVE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0009)
THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE SIZE IN HER JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0010)
IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS BRAINED GULLET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0011)
THE HAWK ALIGHTED FROM THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0012)
LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY TO THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0013)
THAT HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0014)
ALMOST INSTANTLY HE WAS FORCED TO THE FLOOR	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0015)
STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK GLIDED UPON HIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0016)
BUT AT THIS POINT AND THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0017)
AND THIS FREQUENTER OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0018)
AS HE FLEW HIS TOP REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0019)
WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASP REACH	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0020)
BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD AND YET HESITATED TO STRIKE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0021)
THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED AND DECEIVED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0022)
HE HAD A LOT OF LINE UP AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CASTE BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0023)
THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT DROPPED JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0024)
AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHER MEN STANDING ON THE BANK	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0025)
THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CRACK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0026)
THEN THE LEADING PARTED FROM THE LINE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0027)
HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR THE PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO A SYMPOSIUM ON THE PRICE OF GOLF BALLS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0000)
IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL THINK SO	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0001)
BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMATIST HAS HIS POINTS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0002)
YOUR PLAY MUST BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLACE BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0003)
FRANKLY I CANNOT ALWAYS SAY THIS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0004)
BUT SUPPOSED YOU SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0005)
I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I'D BEST KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0006)
ANYHOW IT'S JOLLY EXCITING AND I CAN DO THE DIALOGUE ON RIGHT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0007)
LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT THE STAGE CRAFT IS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0008)

NOW THE OBJECT OF MY SOLILOQUY IS PLAIN	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0011)
INDEED IRRESOLUTION BEING THE KEYNOTES OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEANING	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0012)
WE MODERNS HOWEVER SEE THE ABSURDITY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0013)
IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS AN OPPOSITION TO THE MODERN STAGE TECHNIQUE HOW SHALL A SOLILOQUY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0014)
AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHERE OPHELIA MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON COMMITTAL OF THAT SORT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0015)
THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO SELF	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0016)
IN THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE IN HIS CONFIDENCE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0017)
IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLACE HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS THEM WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0018)

THE CROWD DRIFTS OFF LEAVING THE HERO AND HEROINE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE AND THERE YOU CAN BEGIN	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0036)
AND THEN IS THE TIME TO INTRODUCE A MEAL ON THE STAGE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0037)
A STAGE MEAL IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVES TO THE AUDIENCE THAT THE ACTORS EVEN WHEN CALLED CHARLES HOLTREE OR OWEN NEIRS ARE REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0038)

TWO BITES ARE MADE AND THE BREAD IS CRUMBLED WITH AN AIR OF GREAT EAGERNESS INDEED ONE FEELS THAT IN REAL LIFE THE GUESTS WOULD CLUTCH HOLD OF THE FOOTMAN AND SAY HALF AN OLD CHAP I HAVEN'T NEARLY FINISHED BUT THE ACTOR IS BETTER SCHOOLED THAN THIS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0043)

THE BOGUS LEGISLATURE NUMBERED SEVENTY SIX MEMBERS	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0000)
THIS WAS AT THE MARCH ELECTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0001)
THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STATES GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO FAMILIES	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0002)
FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN THIS SCALE	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0003)

AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF GURCHESTON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0001)
WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM FROM SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0002)
THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSE'S COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DELICATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE IN SCOTLAND	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0003)
FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN DELIVERED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCOE WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0004)

THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS A VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0006)
BY QUICK MARCHES FROM THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0007)
WITH THESE AND SOME REINFORCEMENTS OF THE ATHOL MEN AND MACDONALDS WHOM HE HAD RETAINED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0008)
THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INNERLOCHI SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0009)
BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNERLODE AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTED COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0010)
HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED SIGNIFICANT	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0011)
MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THROUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0012)
FOR THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD RELY ON	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0013)
BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE OBJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0014)
THOUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS SUGGESTED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0015)
VALOUR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS RETAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN GREAT MEASURE WANTING	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0016)
HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANY THING BUT HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOUR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINED THE SUCCESS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0017)
HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW AND THE HILL	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0000)
THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS EXPECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0001)
THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THEIR KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0002)
OR HATH HE GIVEN US AN GIFT	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0003)
AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE SIN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0004)
ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS NEW PSALM TO BE SUNG	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0005)
THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED HER THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0006)
HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOURE	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0007)
THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE OF PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0008)
THE PARTY AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0009)
BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THEIR SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0010)
THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISGUST	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0011)
IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCOUR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED THIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0012)
HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE AND	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0013)
THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR REAL ENTERPRISE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0000)
WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS TO THEIR USUAL CORRELETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0001)
WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH A WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0002)
AND WHAT SORTS OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0003)
THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A PROPOSITION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0004)
ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TUNABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN I REMEMBER	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0005)
THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOR HAS TO TROUBLE HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0006)
HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIORIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHILE IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0007)
THOUGH I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE IS WARRANTED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0008)
OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THEIR PRESENT IMAGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0009)
WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND QUICKLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0010)
SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS APPEAR STRANGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0011)
THAT FAMILIARITY IS A FEELING CAPABLE OF DEGREES	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0012)
OF AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0013)
I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0014)
THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THAT PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0015)
IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME AMERICAN EVENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0016)
THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE THE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0017)
THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ALREADY OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0018)
IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROGRESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0019)
IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR NOT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0020)
REMEMBERING WAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0021)
SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT IT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0022)
IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER OBSCURE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0023)
THE FIRST OF HER VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0024)
WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THE WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMEDIACY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0025)
THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OR MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0026)
A GRAMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PASSAGE AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0027)
I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0028)
THE FACT THAT THE MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0029)
SYMONDS'S TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TEACH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0030)
THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMBER	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0031)
IT'S THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0032)
IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSIONS THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0033)
WHEN EVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0034)
THUS OUR KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0035)
A FURTHER STAGE IS REPRESENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0036)
RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN THE HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTICS WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNISE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0037)
WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNISE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGEMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THE FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0038)
THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT DOES NOT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0039)
