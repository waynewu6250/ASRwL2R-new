HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY AND HOLINESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0012)
IF EVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSES THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER KNIGHT	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0013)
HE TRIED TO THINK HOW HE COULD BE	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0014)

STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY AT HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HERON CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0017)
IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINE OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0018)

HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND THOUGHT	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0027)
THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOUR OF SAINT FRANCIS XAVOUR WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0028)
ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOONS AFTER BEADS	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0029)
BEWARED OF MAKING THAT MISTAKE	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0030)
STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FADE WITH FEAR LIKE AN WITHERING FLOWER	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0031)
HE IS CALLED AS YOU SEE THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIES	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0032)
A GREAT SAINT FRANCIS XAVIOUR	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0033)

A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS SAVIOUR	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0036)
IN THE SILENCE A DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUSK INTO A TAWNY GLOW	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0037)
HE MUST WAIT NO LONGER	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0000)
FOR A FULL HALF HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0001)
HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED A CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0002)
THE ADMINISTRATION	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0003)
PRIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTING HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0004)
WHOSE FEET ARE AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING STARS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0005)
THE PRIDE OF A DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD REFUSED	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0006)
SOON THE WHOLE CITY WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0007)
THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK ON THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0008)
ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOPHEAVY SILK HATS AND HUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKEY	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0009)
BROTHER MACARDELL BROTHER KEOF	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0010)
THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN ITS ELABORATE ADORATION	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0011)
IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM AND LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0012)
IDLE AND EMBITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENTS OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0013)
THE SPACE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN ACCORD	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0014)
WHAT WAS IT THEIR COLORS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0015)
THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NOMADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BEYOND	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0016)
THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEYD AND WOOD BEGIRT AND CITADELED AND OF INTRENCHED AND MARSHALLED RACES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0017)
YOU AGAIN AGAIN	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0018)
A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD CALLING	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0019)
HELLA STEPHANOS HERE COMES THE DAEDALUS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0020)
THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HEWN STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSEPLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WET LUSTER	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0021)
HE STOOD STILL IN DEFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BANTER WITH ANGRY WORDS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0022)
IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORDLIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE SACREDNESS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0023)
STEPHANNO STEADLOS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0024)
A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAZE RAPT SEA	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0025)
YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR WOMEN TITIAN HOLBEIN TURNER AND TINTORET IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0000)
THEY UNITE EVERY QUALITIES AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERRING TO THEM AS COLOURISTS SOMETIMES AS CHIOSCURISTS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0001)
BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOUR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CUROSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTIONS THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0002)
MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE TO ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUE SIDE BY SIDE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0003)
SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALIZE HARD AT THE EDGE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0004)
IT IS THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN ITS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPATIUS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0005)
THERE HE COMES TO THE BEAK OF IT	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0006)
THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK IS PUT WITH THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GREY DEFINE THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0007)
FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH HE CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0008)
NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS INCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONISE WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEY ARE GRADATED JUSTLY	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0009)
BUT IN THIS VIGNETTE COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PROPERLY	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0010)
THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAT I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECTS ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVORITE CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0011)
IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORIST WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUE WAS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0012)
IT MUST REMEMBER TO ONE OR THE OTHER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0013)
DO NOT THEREFORE SAY THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL IS AN EASY ONE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0014)
THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERY THING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MISTS OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0015)
THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0016)
THAT A STYLE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALMOST ERRONEOUS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0017)
IN ALL EARTHLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND SOMETIMES DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0018)
THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT ARE MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0019)
BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH WE SEEK IN IMAGINATION	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0020)
IT WILL BE FULLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0021)
YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT SPEAK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0022)
THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PAROQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKES HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGING AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0023)
NOTHING MAY BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0024)
YOU KNOW I'VE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THE SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM IN CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0025)
HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELLOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO IN THE PYTHON	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0026)

THUS IN CHAUCER'S JOURNEY	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0035)
IN BOTH THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATION THOUGH SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0036)
EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF HOLBEIN OR DURROW	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0037)
BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT ALL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0038)
IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALITY OR PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0039)
THAT CRAMPNESS AND THE POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0040)

SEE THAT OUR LIVES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED KITE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0043)
IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KITES FLY FALCONS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE IN LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WARWOLF AND THE GEAR EAGLE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0044)

HE QUITTED THE FIRE AND DROPPED BACK UPON HIS CHAIR	(121-127105-121-127105-0015)
PROBABLY NOT TILL THE FIRST POST	(121-127105-121-127105-0016)

WELL IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHAT HE WAS	(121-127105-121-127105-0022)
LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT HIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE	(121-127105-121-127105-0023)
POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE ON THAT NIGHT OF THE FOURTH	(121-127105-121-127105-0024)
THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS WORKED US UP	(121-127105-121-127105-0025)
THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED AND THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN	(121-127105-121-127105-0026)
HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE OF ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED	(121-127105-121-127105-0027)
THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT WE HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME	(121-127105-121-127105-0028)
THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE AT SUPREME AUTHORITY	(121-127105-121-127105-0029)
I DON'T UNDERSTAND	(121-127105-121-127105-0030)
SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES OF LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS	(121-127105-121-127105-0031)
YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER POSITION	(121-127105-121-127105-0032)
IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF YOU	(121-127105-121-127105-0033)
IT SOUNDED DULL BUT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS OWN CONDITION WHICH WAS	(121-127105-121-127105-0034)
SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE HAD ALREADY FELT REWARDED	(121-127105-121-127105-0035)
OR WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED	(121-127105-121-127105-0036)
HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW THE QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0000)
GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH HE THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONOURED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0001)
YET THESE THOUGHTS CONNECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0002)
THIS CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0003)
THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED OR DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0004)
HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE EARLE WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0005)
THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION FOR LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0006)
HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THAT SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0007)
MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE THE TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0008)
AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PAUL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0009)
IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING IN SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0010)
BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGUN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0011)
BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER MIND THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0012)
PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0013)
PEARLIE SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0014)
AND IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0015)
HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FOREIGN RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0000)
ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON TO THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0001)
AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WAS STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0002)
A PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0003)
WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A LIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0004)
IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM FROM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0005)
THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER PERCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0006)
BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDEA HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0007)
COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD AT IT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0008)
BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HIS ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0009)
SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF A SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0010)
IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FROM THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0011)
THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICED WINDOWS THEIR WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0012)
LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG IN THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0013)
YEA HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GOODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEECH	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0014)
YE MAY NOT SEE MY WORSHIP NOW	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0015)
WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AT THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIREST STATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0016)
ON THAT TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0017)
LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTISPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF A BREASTPLATE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0018)
MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE GO LOOK	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0019)
IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BESIDE IT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0020)
PEARLE ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE SHOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0021)
AND THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0022)
THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THIS HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BULL	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0023)
PEARL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND COULD NOT BE PACIFIED	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0024)
HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEE PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BROWN BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0000)
HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AT A FLAT BRIM AND ROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0001)
INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD SIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0002)
FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WAITED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0003)
WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNCH SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0004)
NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSES EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0005)
AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTY OF THE GILLICANS THE PATH DIVIDED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0006)
HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS HER NEAREST NEIGHBOR	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0007)
ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAS PLACED IN HIS POCKET	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0008)
THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPTE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0009)
UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0010)
I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY COMPANY	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0011)
WE'VE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0012)
AND YOU MUST SEE OJO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0013)
OJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A LIKE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0014)
WE WERE TRAVELLING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOP AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0015)
THE BOY SEEMED THOUGHTFUL	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0016)
AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THAT FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0017)
IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT WAS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0018)
YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE FOR OLD MOMBI THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0019)
THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT LIVED EVER SINCE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0020)
I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEARTS FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0021)
I'M AFRAID I WOULDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0022)
YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC NUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0023)
THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THAT UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0024)
I THINK I SHALL SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGOLOTTE LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0025)
BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEALS AND WASH DISHES	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0026)
THEN THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0027)
A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS OR COLORS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0028)
SOMETIMES IT WAS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0029)
WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0030)
AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OZMA LIVES GREAT IS THE POPULAR COLOUR	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0031)
I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND DREW OPEN THE DOORS	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0032)
OJO HAD EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0000)
MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THAT PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL THROUGHOUT	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0001)
THE HEAD IN THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0002)
THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN THREE NEAT BRAIDS	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0003)
GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON MEDALS IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0004)
NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT HER BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0005)
WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH SO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0006)
SHE POURED INTO THIS DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0007)
I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES IS NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0008)

THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AFRAID THAT SOME ONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0007)
THE PROOF WAS IN TWO LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0008)
THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD STARTED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0009)
I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHERE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0010)

HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT MORE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0027)
THEN I TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0028)

AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR EMERGENCY	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0034)
HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HALLO WHAT IS THIS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0035)
HOLMES HUNG IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0036)
WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO MY BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0037)

I DARE NOT GO AS FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0044)
IT WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0045)
BUT YOU HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0046)

IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0049)
AND MISTER SOLMES SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0050)
IN A DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0000)
THE SELF SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLEANS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0001)
JIM TAYLOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTON	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0002)
BUT BETTER GO HE HAD COUNSELLED SENTENTIOUSLY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0003)

YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH THE NEGROES I'LL SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0009)
AT ANY RATE I SAY YOU GO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0010)
HERE SHE WAS TEACHING THIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODOURS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0011)
SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF GRAND PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0012)
SO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TODAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN TO THE BOTTOMS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0013)
COTTON AND SHE PAUSED	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0014)
SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TOUCH AND SOUND	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0015)
THE GLIMMERING SEA OF NAKED LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0016)
THERE MUST BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0017)
HER COMMAND SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0018)
COTTON IT IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0019)
MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARK IT SEEMED CALLED FOR	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0020)
I DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LITTERALLY BORN IN COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0021)
I S'POSE ALTHOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0022)
GOOBES DON'T GROW ON DE TOPS OF VINES BUT ON DE GROUND ON DE ROOTS LIKE YAMS IS THAT SO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0023)
THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HARKED	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0024)
SOMETIME YOU'LL SEE ME PLEASE WON'T YOU	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0025)
NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATIONS JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTON	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0026)
THE HONOURABLE CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MISTER EASTLEY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0000)
AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS RELATED FOR THE SENATE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0001)
WHY WOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0002)
SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED AT HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERS	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0003)
AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESTS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TO NIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CRITON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CRITON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESWELL AND HIS SISTER AND JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0004)
MISSUS GREY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT THAT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0005)
SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING A NEGRO EDUCATION	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0006)
DO YOU BELIEVE IN SOME COMMUNICATION ASKED MARY TAYLOR	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0007)
I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDS HIM	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0008)
BUT CRESWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY A CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACES	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0009)
THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GREEN WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0010)
POSITIVELY HEROIC ADDED CRESWELL AVOIDING HER SISTER'S EYES	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0011)
BUT WE'RE NOT ALL EXACTLY WELCOME	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0012)

FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THE MATTERS	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0014)
HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS AND ZORIAS MUST BE RUINED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0000)
IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0001)
I AH THE SWAMP THE CRUEL SWAMP	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0002)
THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0003)
HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND COULD NOT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0004)
SHE WAS SO STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL A CREATURE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0005)
THE WORLD WAS WATER VEILED BY MISTS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0006)
THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MID DAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH GLEAMED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0007)
HERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0008)
THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DIKES A WEEK AGO AND THEN	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0009)
PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING HELPING	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0010)
HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH LOUDLY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0011)
HE SPLASHED AND STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRANCHES	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0012)
NOW HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0013)
HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND THE GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0014)
THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WAS JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BOWLS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0015)
FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST THE WALL	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0016)
HE GATHERED ABOUT PERPLEXED ASTONISHED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0017)
HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAINS NO ONE HAD DUG A CANAL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0018)
HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST SIRE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0019)
THE YEARS OF HER DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0020)
THE HOPE THE DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0021)
UP IN THAT SICK ROOM ZORA LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0022)
THE NET OR WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0023)
FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE TO SUN AND BIRD AND TREE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0024)
SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN CLIMBING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0025)
SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MET HER LOVER	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0026)
ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LO THE CATTLE LAY BEFORE HER	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0027)
THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW THAT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0028)
HE DARTED FROM THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0029)
IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOW AND THE DOORPLACE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0000)
BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NOT OPENED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0001)
FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THEIR GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0002)

AND NOT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0004)
SEVERAL CLOSE HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLORED RAGS	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0005)
AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRANGE RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0006)
THE HISTORY OF THEIR HOUSE IS PLAIN NOW	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0007)
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO THE MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0008)

HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE AND IN THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0010)
DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY OF FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHTED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0011)
THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THAT CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0012)
HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT SEEM TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0013)
THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WHITDAHS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0014)
TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO THE SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0015)

NO NO NO DOTTY'D GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0028)
DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THAT BLUE STREAM	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0029)
TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKING PIG	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0030)
AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO AUNT JANE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0031)
I OFTEN HEARD HER TALKED OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0032)
WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH AND YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I AM SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0033)

I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THIS VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0038)

I DIRECTION	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0041)
THEY HAD A COMMON PATIENCE WITH YOU	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0042)
BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GONE DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT WAS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO COME IN	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0043)
SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALTY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0044)
OH SIR DON'T MENTION IT CRIED MISSUS POYSER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0045)
I DELIGHT IN YOUR POSITION	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0046)
POLYSER IS NOT AT HOME IS HE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0047)
SAID CAPTAIN DONITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0048)
NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSITUR TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTORY ABOUT THE WOOL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0049)
WELL THERE'S FATHER IN THE BARN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0050)
NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WHELPS AND LEAVE THE MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0051)
I SHALL COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0052)
FOR IF HE'S ANYWHERE ON THE FARM WE COULD SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0053)
OH DEAR SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0054)
BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO MISTER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0055)
I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PALACE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0056)
I KNOW HIS FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO MEET IT	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0057)
BY THE BYE I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY MISS POYSER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0058)
YES MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0059)
OH I' HAVE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0060)
THE PARIS PLANT LIKE THAT AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A LITERARY EXHIBIT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0000)
THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND PLANTS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0001)
THERE MESSRS JACKSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0002)
THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE SEVENTEEN YEARS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0003)
OWING TO THIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0004)
WHY IF WE ERECT A STATION AT THE FALLS IT'S A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0005)
THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR FEELING THAT IT WILL CHANGE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0006)
BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATICLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0007)
EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THAT CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0008)
FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON IS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0009)
IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITIONS NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0010)
BUT WHERE IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARM HOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0011)
EDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM I COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALVANOMETER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0012)
UNLESS HE COULD SECURE A ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0013)
MISTER EDISON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF OUR TIME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0014)
HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALMOST REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0015)
THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME POINT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0016)
EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAINE INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIGHT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0017)
HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR A LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0018)
A STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0019)
IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER IS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0020)
THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRE STATIONS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0021)
MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEMS KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0022)
I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAN I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT TILL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0023)
AND THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0024)
THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF EDDICONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0025)
THE ARK LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOUR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0026)
EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOPE A METRE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0027)
THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY MADE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0028)
HENCE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTI METRE IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0029)
THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METRE IS THIS WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0030)
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS ARE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERINGS AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0031)
THE STANDARD EDISON METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATIONS ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0032)
IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THIS TIME WITH THE METRE THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0033)
THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN ACTION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BASIS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0034)
IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METRE WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY ME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0035)
A METRE CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0036)
HE WEIGHED AND RE WEIGHED A METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0037)
HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS SOME KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0038)
THE WHOLE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0039)
WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE SEASON THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0040)
WE HAD METRES IN WHICH THERE WAS TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0041)
HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LONELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME	(237-126133-237-126133-0000)
EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON THEIR TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS	(237-126133-237-126133-0001)
THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME AND EVEN AMONG FRIENDS	(237-126133-237-126133-0002)

O NO JAPPER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF	(237-126133-237-126133-0016)

HE CALLED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY	(237-126133-237-126133-0023)
THEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME	(237-126133-237-126133-0024)

FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL EMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLECULES THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE BUT INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM	(260-123288-260-123288-0015)

WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH ANY LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0000)
THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLING HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0001)
LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON GELLATIONS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0002)
THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES SEEMED OPPRESSIVE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0003)
IT WAS RICH IN LATIN	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0004)
HER WORK HAD TO BE CONDENSED	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0005)
A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ONGILATIONS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0006)
MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY JALLATIONS FOR INSTANCE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0007)
IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND RULER PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0008)
IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S EFFORTS ALONE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0009)
BUT THE LESSON OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THERE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0010)
THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWERS TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE TWO	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0011)

AGAINST THESE BOASTFUL FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY AND MINISTRY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0006)

PAUL TAKES PRIDE OF HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0008)
PAUL AN APOSTLE IS NOT OF MEN ET CETERA	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0009)
EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS FROM THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0010)
PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED NOR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0011)
THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WAS SENT BY OTHERS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0012)
HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED PARTICULARLY BY GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0013)

WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS SCHOOL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0017)
I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE IN THE MINISTRY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0018)
I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND THAT NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0019)
THIS WAS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS HOLY PRIDE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0020)

BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER THOUGHT SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0025)
FIRST SHE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0026)
AND OF THE BRETHREN WHICH ARE WITH ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0027)
THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FIERCE APOSTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0028)
ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS THEY DO	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0029)
THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CRIMINALS ARE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0030)
WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE SEEN BY THE HELP OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0031)
WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0032)
NOT ALL THE GALICIANS HAD BECOME PERVERTED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0033)
THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTRAMINATED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0034)
THEY REMAIN DIVINED REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0035)
WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND HERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNS THERE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0036)
SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE EIGHT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0037)
GRACE ME TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0038)
THE TERMS OF GRACE OR PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0039)
THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS CHERISHING	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0040)
OF GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0041)
AND THE WORLD BRANDS THIS A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0042)
EXPERIENCE PROVEDS THIS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0043)
HOWEVER THAT GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0044)
WOMEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0045)
WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO GIVE FROM GOD THE FATHER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0046)
TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN YOU SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0047)
HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVE AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0048)
EMBRACE HIM AND THINK ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0049)
DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO MY FATHER BUT BY ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0050)
WHEN YOU ARGUE OVER THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0051)
WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS THEIR DIVINE TEACHER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0052)
AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS MY CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0053)
THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH HIS FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0054)
TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD HE ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0055)
OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE TO GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0056)
THE ARCHIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0057)
MOHAMMAD ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0058)
PAUL STICKS TO HIS THATME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0059)
HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF AN EPISTLE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0060)
NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR A PASHA LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0061)
NOT FOR THE CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0062)
UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS OR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0063)
HOW MAY I OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0064)
PAUL ASKS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0065)
SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY WILL NOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0066)
THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS TO A SINGLE SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0067)
THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOMS CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0068)
THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THEIR WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0069)
BUT YOU ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0070)
WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK ON MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0071)
THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SERVED UNDER SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0072)
THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0073)
HIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0074)
BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS TO OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0075)
ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO DESIRABLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0076)
HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS IN NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE	(2961-960-2961-960-0000)
THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO THIS MISUNDERSTANDING	(2961-960-2961-960-0001)
IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF HIS DIALOGUE THE NEO PLATONISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CONNECTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO	(2961-960-2961-960-0002)
THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC IN HIS EFFORTS TO REALIZE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL	(2961-960-2961-960-0003)
THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEOPLAINISTS	(2961-960-2961-960-0004)
IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AS BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT	(2961-960-2961-960-0005)
THE FANCIES OF THE NEOPLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY	(2961-960-2961-960-0006)
BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN THAT SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM	(2961-960-2961-960-0007)
WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED IS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND	(2961-960-2961-960-0008)
THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATIONS INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS	(2961-960-2961-960-0009)
BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AND IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL	(2961-960-2961-960-0010)
WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE ANXAGORRAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBERS	(2961-960-2961-960-0011)
MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THIS TIMAEUS	(2961-960-2961-960-0012)
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY THEM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE	(2961-960-2961-960-0013)
THE INDIANS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES	(2961-960-2961-960-0014)
THE STYLE AND PLACE OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES	(2961-960-2961-960-0015)
BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PEDRES OR SYMPOSIUM	(2961-960-2961-960-0016)
NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER THIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER	(2961-960-2961-960-0017)
AND IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP	(2961-960-2961-960-0018)
HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND IN THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA	(2961-960-2961-960-0019)
AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POLE OF LUCRETIUS	(2961-960-2961-960-0020)
THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAT OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIER WRITINGS	(2961-960-2961-960-0021)
PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCED A PERFECT WORK OF ART	(2961-960-2961-960-0022)
SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THAT REPUBLIC	(2961-961-2961-961-0000)
AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN ANY GREAT STRUGGLE	(2961-961-2961-961-0001)
AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS SON OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIAS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE	(2961-961-2961-961-0002)
I WILL IF TIMAEUS APPROVES I WILL APPROVE	(2961-961-2961-961-0003)
LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SALLUS WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF TROPIDUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME	(2961-961-2961-961-0004)
SOME POEMS OF SALEN WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS	(2961-961-2961-961-0005)
THEN WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEM SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK	(2961-961-2961-961-0006)
THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE AND DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED	(2961-961-2961-961-0007)
BUT THE MEMORY OF HER EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS	(2961-961-2961-961-0008)
TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SAWEN HEARD THIS STORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0009)
BUT IN EGYPT THE RELIGIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOREVER IN OUR TEMPLES	(2961-961-2961-961-0010)
THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNALS CALLEN ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0011)
FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAVE THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN	(2961-961-2961-961-0012)
SELLA MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS	(2961-961-2961-961-0013)
NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED OURS AS OUR ANNALS RECORDS	(2961-961-2961-961-0014)
MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG THEM WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME	(2961-961-2961-961-0015)
I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ AN ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS	(2961-961-2961-961-0016)
OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE THE LAW TOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF A WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN	(2961-961-2961-961-0017)
THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WERE THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS	(2961-961-2961-961-0018)
FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND AS THE OTHER HELLENES HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS	(2961-961-2961-961-0019)
THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEANS	(2961-961-2961-961-0020)
BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME IF I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0021)
THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I WILL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORDS SPOKE	(2961-961-2961-961-0022)
BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE LIGHT SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0000)
THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPATION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0001)
SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORTS AND FULNESS OF LIFE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0002)
WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE OF CULTURE THIS TABOO MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABOO OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0003)
IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE HIGHEST CLASS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0004)
UNDER THE TABOO CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED TO THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0005)
DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SPIRITUAL STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0006)
IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLEMAN	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0007)
THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE FORMER	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0008)
WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THIS PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0009)
THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS OBJECTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0010)
THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0011)
THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANKS IN GRATES	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0012)
THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE IN GENTILITY	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0013)
MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THIS SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0014)
SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKEUP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0015)
MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THE PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMERS IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0016)
THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARKS OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0017)
THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FAIR AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0018)
BUT THE GENERAL IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0019)
SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF HORSES AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0020)
WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED ORIFIC CHARACTER	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0021)
THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WORK IT	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0022)
IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY TWO GROUPS COINCIDE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0000)
THE DEPENDENCE WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0001)
BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON A WIFE ALONE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0002)
IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT FIRST FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0003)
IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCES IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0004)
THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALL THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASED TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0005)
HOW MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENSE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0006)
THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEEDS	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0007)
THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO ACT	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0008)
EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SPIRITUAL GROWTH	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0009)
THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO TO ANOTHER LINE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0010)
IT WAS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0011)
IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS THE MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0012)
CONSUMPTION BECOMES A HIGHER ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0013)
AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEIGHBOURHOOD GOSSIPS SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE SAME GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0014)
THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN OF ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0015)
UNDER THE SIMPLE TASTE OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0000)
BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE CORSAT PEACEABLE CULTURE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0001)
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THIS INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0002)

TO THE FERVENT LATTER DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING THE HOUSE FOR A RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0010)

BE IT SAID TO THE HONOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS INTRUSTED WITH THAT TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNT ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGN THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0016)
OH WHAT A SECRET TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0017)
AMERICAN SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ABBAGGINZES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH THE PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE VAUDOIS HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECTS OF A ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0018)

ALREADY A NORTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF WHY NOT SIT UP ALSO A WEST	(4077-13754-4077-13754-0004)
THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH NO EAST NO WEST THEY STOOD POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN AND ARMS TO THEIR COUNTRY'S NEED	(4077-13754-4077-13754-0005)

AT THE INCEPTION OF PLURAL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL AND STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTICE	(4077-13754-4077-13754-0009)

STEAM UP AND CANVASES SPREAD THE SCHOONER STARTED EASTWARDS	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0003)

TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF THE LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM DEPTH OF FROM FOUR TO FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SITE OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRACED LIKE THE SEATS OF AN AMPHITHEATRE	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0015)

ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARREN OF THE MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0018)
NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN IN SATISFACTION TOWARDS THE NORTH	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0019)

AND TOWARDS CHRISTMAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS GOT DOWN	(672-122797-672-122797-0021)
THE AXE STRUCK DEEP INTO THE VERY PITH THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANG IT WAS LIKE A SWOON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE IT HAD SPRUNG UP	(672-122797-672-122797-0022)
HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANY MORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE WOODS	(672-122797-672-122797-0023)
THE TOBACCO WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE	(672-122797-672-122797-0024)
THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT OTHERS	(672-122797-672-122797-0025)
THERE TOO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WORTH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN DID SO	(672-122797-672-122797-0026)

CRY THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE	(672-122797-672-122797-0032)
STORY I	(672-122797-672-122797-0033)
A STORY CRIED THE CHILDREN DRAWING A LITTLE FAT MAN TOWARDS THE STREET	(672-122797-672-122797-0034)
BUT I CANNOT TELL ONLY ONE STORY	(672-122797-672-122797-0035)
HUMPITY DUMPY FELL DOWN STAIRS AND YET HE MARRIED THE PRINCESS	(672-122797-672-122797-0036)
WHICH'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD	(672-122797-672-122797-0037)
THOUGHT THE FIR TREE AND BELIEVED IT ALL BECAUSE THE MAN WHO TOLD THE STORY WAS SO GOOD LOOKING VERY WELL	(672-122797-672-122797-0038)
I WON'T TRIFLE TO MORROW THOUGHT THE FIR TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0039)
AND THE WHOLE TIME THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT	(672-122797-672-122797-0040)
IN THAT MORNING THE SERVANT AND THE HOUSEMAID CAME IN	(672-122797-672-122797-0041)
BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT WOULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM	(672-122797-672-122797-0042)
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT MY TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0043)
THEN HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERY	(672-122797-672-122797-0044)
TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TIME FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY	(672-122797-672-122797-0045)
TIS NOW WINTER OUT O DOORS THOUGHT THE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0046)
THAT KIND MAN IS AFTER ALL	(672-122797-672-122797-0047)

I AM BY NO MEANS OLD OLD SAID THE FIR TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0051)
THERE'S MANY A ONE I CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN I AM	(672-122797-672-122797-0052)
THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY CORDIAL	(672-122797-672-122797-0053)
I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE MAN	(672-122797-672-122797-0054)
AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THAT LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LISTENED AND SAID	(672-122797-672-122797-0055)
SAID THE FIR TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF RELATE	(672-122797-672-122797-0056)
YES IN REALITY THOSE WERE A HAPPY TIMES	(672-122797-672-122797-0057)
WHO IS HUMPY DUMPY CRIED THE MICE	(672-122797-672-122797-0058)
ONLY THAT MORNING ANSWERED THE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0059)
IT IS A VERY SHREWD STORY	(672-122797-672-122797-0060)
DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BACON AND TALLOW CANDLES CAN'T YOU KNOW ANY LARDER STORIES	(672-122797-672-122797-0061)
NEVER SAID THE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0062)
THEY GOOD BYE SAID THE RATS AND THEY WENT HOME	(672-122797-672-122797-0063)
AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALSO AND THE TREE SIGHED AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN THE SLEEK LITTLE MICE SAT ROUND AND LISTENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM	(672-122797-672-122797-0064)
YES THAT TOO IS OVER	(672-122797-672-122797-0065)
WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFTS	(672-122797-672-122797-0066)
THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED UP AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE	(672-122797-672-122797-0067)
BUT THIS WAS NOT THE FIR TREE THAT THEY MEANT	(672-122797-672-122797-0068)
IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG THE WEEDS AND NETTLES	(672-122797-672-122797-0069)
THE GOLDEN HAIR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE	(672-122797-672-122797-0070)
IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MERRIEST CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM	(672-122797-672-122797-0071)
AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES AND THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE	(672-122797-672-122797-0072)
THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE STRANGE BREWING COPPER AND IT SIGHED SO DEEPLY	(672-122797-672-122797-0073)
HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE THING GONE THE STORY AT AN END	(672-122797-672-122797-0074)
KENNETH AND BETH REFRAINED FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OF UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGERS'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORGING A CHECK	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0000)

I CAN'T SEE HIM IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0002)
IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A WOMAN HE LOVED	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0003)
BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY FOR SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0004)
HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE YOU DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0005)
IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGED CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED ITS FREEDOM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0006)

I WAS BILLKEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHEQUE AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0030)
AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM THE HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0031)

HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GAMES	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0049)
BETH UNEASY AT MY SILENCE NUDGED HIM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0050)
THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMAZEMENT ON HIS SHREWD FACE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0051)
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'S BEEN SHARP	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0052)

HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAID'S SHOULDERS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0031)
HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORM MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HAD TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0032)

BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE WU COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0017)
THAT NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLIT AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYWHERE	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0018)
UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE BROKEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGSTONES	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0019)
BRAGELONNE WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVIL MURMURS OF MANI KEMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0020)

THERE WERE CERTAINLY NO NEARER THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0001)
THE POOR LITTLE THINGS REPLIED CYNTHIA THINK OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0002)
AND WHAT IS THE SENSE OF IT TWO INNOCENT BABIES LIKE THAT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0003)
BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE SET DOWN HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACED HER COMPANION	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0004)
THE TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DON'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICTURE TO THE WALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0005)
HERS HAPPENED TO BE ON THE SAME FORM TOO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0006)
NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHIA SPRUGUE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0007)
I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMPED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE IT'S BEEN OF SOME USE AFTER ALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0008)
AND DO YOU SUPPOSE THE MINIATURE WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0009)
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT YOU QUERIED JOYCE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0010)

IT CAN'T HURT ANYTHING I'M SURE AND WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0013)
THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DOES NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PAIR	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0014)
SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PARAPHERNALIA INTO THIS CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUST PAN TO THE OUTFIT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0015)
THE LURE PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A YOUNGER KITTEN MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0016)
OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE URGED I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT LITTLE HOUSE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0017)
HE MADE IT SORT OF COSIER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0018)
NOW LET'S DUST THE FURNITURE ON PICTURES	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0019)
YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0020)
SURFACE DUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS OWN ELEGANCE AND POLISH	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0021)
THERE SHE SUDDENLY REMARKED	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0022)
AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW DOWN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0023)
THEY SAY ILLUMINATION AT CANDLE LIGHT IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0024)
WHY IT'S GOLIATH AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING OUT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0025)
ISN'T HE THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO IDLE CORNERS	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0026)
FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND SCURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME CORNER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0027)
WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY MUCH LATER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0028)
NO WORDS WAS SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0000)
I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW KABIR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0001)
ONWARD SAID A PLEASANT VOICE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0002)
NO A SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0003)
THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WERE NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0004)
ONE WAS THAT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0005)
WHAT THEN A HANDSOME HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0006)
NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST TO WHICH HE MIGHT BE ATTACHED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0007)
IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL HE WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0008)
I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMS AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS KAFFIR	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0009)
A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF SUNLIGHT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0010)
A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I IS AWAKE WHERE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0011)
SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZED AS VOLTAIRE'S KAFFIR AND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0012)
I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKING AT MY HAND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0013)
IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALMOST DISCOLORED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0014)
I DO NOT KNOW NOW I AM DAZED BEWILDERED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0015)
BUT THERE IS KAFFIR'S KNIFE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0016)
I KNOW HE HAVE IT THIS VERY EVENING	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0017)
I REMEMBERED SAYING HAVE WE BEEN THERE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0018)
VOLTAIRE PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND WENT AT IT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0019)
I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT ALL THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0020)
A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY OWN MIND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0021)
I HAD NEVER BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0022)
PERCHANCE TOO KAFFIR'S DEATH WOULD SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0023)
MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH REFUSED ME	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0024)
MY POSITION WAS TOO AGREEABLE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0025)
MY OWN OVERWROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0026)
FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I HAVE REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0027)
THE THREE ROADS OF MANAGEMENT	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0000)
TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS CHARACTER AND DESIGN	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0001)
BY REASON IN AFFECTION	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0002)
AS THE CHAISE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE MASTER DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT AND VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR SURGE AND SWELL AMONGST THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0003)
THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHAISE HAS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0004)
SO YOU WILL BE THE GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0005)
THE MOTHER OF MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0006)
IF YOU SHALL NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0007)
AND THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0008)
IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE INFLUENCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CANNOT BE OVERRATED	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0009)
TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO HIS WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0000)
DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS MARY	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0001)
NOW DELLIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0002)
TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF EM IN FULL	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0003)
YOU HAVE COME ANDELLA AND STELLA WAS THE NAME OF JANE'S DOLL TO TAKE ROSALIE A VISIT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0004)
BUT I AM VERY GLAD	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0005)
I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL AND YOU WERE HERE LAST	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0006)
THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL LADY	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0007)
FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYED UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0008)
THEY WAS NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOUR	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0009)
DELIA CAME TO THE PARLOUR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSALIE HERE AND DONT SAY A WORD TO THEM	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0010)
SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND RATHER BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0011)
SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHINGS THE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0012)
PUT THESE PLAYTHINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM SAY ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0013)
AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THEIR CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0014)
NATURE OF THAT EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0000)
THAT IS COMPARATIVELY LONG	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0001)
THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED THROUGH COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0002)
VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHINGS	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0003)
WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTIONS IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0004)
THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS A SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0005)
BUT THENERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0000)
HE HAD MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0001)
HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE A HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKKNIFE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0002)
NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND THENERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKKNIFE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0003)
YES WHAT NOT THOUGHT ANDERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0004)
SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE COUNT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0005)
I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANNAS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0006)
AND SHE TOOK ANDER'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THREE STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0007)
FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A SAINT WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0008)
AT THE FURTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLD CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0009)
ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN FLICKERING DECANTERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0010)
THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET ANDER SIT ON A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0011)
BUT YOU MUST NOT ENTER WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0012)
THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE DRESSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0013)
YOU ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0014)
WELL BUT NOT SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0015)
THAT IS A VERY BEST CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0016)
SO IT IS SAID ANDERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0017)
AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FOR ME	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0018)
WITH ONE JUMP ANDERS GOT OFF OF HIS CHAIR	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0019)
HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ALONG THE YARD	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0020)
HE STILL HELD ON TO HER WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0021)
AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0022)
BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CUP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0023)
ANDERSON'S FACE GREW RED	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0024)
BUT ITS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0025)
NO MY LITTLE DAUGHTER SHE SAID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0026)
IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN OUR LITTLE RED CAP	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0027)
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SOMETHING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0000)
AM VERY WELL	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0001)
LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AU COURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE COUNT HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0002)
GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT ANNYON AND VILLEROIS TOOK THEIR LEAVE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0003)
CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHEN	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0004)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LUCE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0005)
HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO KEEP IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0006)
IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWN	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0007)

THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN HIS QUADRILLE CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0029)
EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS HESITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BEDIMMED	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0000)

SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR ON WHICH SHE WAS PRESENTLY GOING TO DANCE	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0007)
THE ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM TOTALLY	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0008)

LET US RUN THEN SAID ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR SILK DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE GATE AND THE THICKEST COVERT OF THE PARK	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0038)

IN THIS WAY THE FETE OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FETE ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER IN THE BRAKE THE PHEASANT IN THE BRANCH THE FOX IN ITS HOLE WERE ALL LISTENING	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0040)
ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN HAIR SCATTERED IN BROAD SPLASHES	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0000)
THE MURGANCER HAD A CRUSTED HEAD OF IRIDESCENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PENCILLED IN BLACK AND WHITE AND A BREAST OF RICH CHESTNUT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0001)
HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW TOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0002)
BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDED CLAWS	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0003)
BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMORANT HE SHOT BACK INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0004)
ONCE FAIRLY A SWING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PERCH	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0005)
IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WERE A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0006)
BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WILD FLUKES OF HIS ENGORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARDS INTO THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0007)
IN THE DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO SOON	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0008)
THE GREAT HULK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO RETRIEVE THE PREY FROM THE GROUND	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0009)
THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKING UP THE PRIZE IN HER JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0010)
IN FACT HE HAD JUST REACHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRAINED GULLET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0011)
THE FOX ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0012)
LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADED DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0013)
THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH A SURFACE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0014)
ALMOST INSTANTLY HE WAS ORDERED TO THE TOP	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0015)
STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK GLIDED FROM THIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0016)
FOR AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0017)
BUT THIS FREQUENTER OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED WITH THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0018)
AS HE FLEW HIS OUT REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0019)
WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY BECAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0020)
BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHEN DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0021)
THE COCK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0022)
HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CASTING BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0023)
THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT GOT JUST WITHIN THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0024)
AT THIS SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0025)
THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS FINGERS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0026)
THEN THE LEADER DEPARTED FROM THE LINE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0027)
HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO A SYMPOSIUM THE PRICE OF GOLF BALLS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0000)
IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAID SO	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0001)
BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMATIST HAS HIS METHODS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0002)
YOUR PLAY MUST BE NOT MERELY A REAL PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0003)
FRANKLY I WILL NOT ALWAYS SAY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0004)
BUT SUPPOSE YOU THINK I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0005)
I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR THE PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0006)
ANYHOW IT'S JOLLY EXCITING AND I CAN DO THE DIALOGUE OR RIGHT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0007)
LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL HEAR JUST WHAT STAGE CRAFT IS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0008)
AND I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HOMILY AND SOLILOQUY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0009)
FOR HIM TO BE OR NOT TO BE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0010)
NOW THE OBJECT OF THIS SOLILOQUY IS EXPLAINED	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0011)
INDEED IRRESOLUTION BEING THE KEYNOTE OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A VIOLENT WORKING OF THE JAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEANING	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0012)
WE MODERNS HOWEVER FEEL THE ABSURDITY OF IT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0013)
IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTERS SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO THE MODERN STAGE TECHNIQUE HOW SHALL A SOLILOQUY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0014)
AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN OPHELIA MUST SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON COMMITTAL OF THAT SORT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0015)
THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT THAT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0016)
IN THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE HIS AUDIENCE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0017)
IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS OF WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0018)

THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STATES NEARLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0002)
FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM A STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN THE SCALE	(7729-102255-7729-102255-0003)

THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAILED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0000)
AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF MURCHESTON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM THIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0001)
WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME REGULAR UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0002)
THE KING'S EYES WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSE'S COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE IN SCOTLAND	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0003)
FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCORE WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0004)
DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLEIGH AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0005)
THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ENGAGE HIM	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0006)
BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT THE GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0007)
WITH THESE AND SOME REINFORCEMENTS OF THE ATHOL MEN AND MACDONALDS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYL'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0008)
THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INTERLOCHY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0009)
BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNERLOCH AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTED COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0010)
HIS KNOWLEDGE AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED CONSPICUOUS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0011)
MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH A LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0012)
FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED THE DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD RELY ON	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0013)
BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS WILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0014)
THOUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY ITS NEW COMMANDERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0015)
VALOUR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS MAINTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN GREAT MEASURE WANTING	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0016)
HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANYTHING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOUR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINE THEIR SUCCESS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0017)
WE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILL	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0000)
THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID THEM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0001)
THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF HIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0002)
OR HATH HE GIVEN US A GIFT	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0003)
AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE NO PART IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0004)
ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT URGED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0005)
THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED ON THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0006)
HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD YE DEVOUR	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0007)
THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER CALLED FOR	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0008)
THIS PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0009)
BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TROOPS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0010)
THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAVE THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0011)
IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCOR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0012)
HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A MISFORTUNE	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0013)
THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRIZE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0000)
WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP INDIVIDUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0001)
WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD UNDOUBTEDLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0002)
AND WHAT A SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0003)
THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG TO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0004)
ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TUNABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER IT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0005)
THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE CHARACTER	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0006)
HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS IN DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIORIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0007)
BUT WE DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE IS WARRANTED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0008)
OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE NOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0009)
WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VALUABLE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0010)
SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGELY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0011)
THE FAMILIARITY IS A FEELING CAPABLE OF DEGREES	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0012)
IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTIES MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0013)
I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0014)
THESE MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0015)
IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN ALL REMEMBERED EVENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0016)
THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THAT FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0017)
THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED MEANS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0018)
IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELING GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELING MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0019)
IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT AND KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0020)
REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCASION IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0021)
SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF SLAVERY MUST ARRIVE AT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0022)
IN THIS CASE AS IN ALL OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0023)
THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRESENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0024)
WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDICY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0025)
THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO THROW IN THEORY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0026)
A GRAMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE CHARACTERS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0027)
I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENGAGES ME TO DO THIS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0028)
THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RESTED OR READ IT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0029)
SYMONDS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL QUICKLY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0030)
THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISGUST OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0031)
IT IS THIS IT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0032)
IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN EMOTION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0033)
WHENEVER THIS SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGEMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0034)
THEN NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0035)
A FURTHER STAGE IS READY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0036)
RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN THE HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNISE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0037)
WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNISE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGEMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE POSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0038)
THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE WHILE IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0039)
THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT WILL SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0040)
