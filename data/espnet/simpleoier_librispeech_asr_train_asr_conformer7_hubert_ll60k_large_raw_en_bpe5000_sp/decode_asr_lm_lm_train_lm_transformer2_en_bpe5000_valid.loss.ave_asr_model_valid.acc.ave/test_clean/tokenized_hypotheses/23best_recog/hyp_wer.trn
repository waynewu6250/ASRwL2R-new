HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLINESS A STRONG LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0012)

IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FELT AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0018)

THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOUR OF SAINT FRANCIS XAVIERS WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0028)
ON FRIDAY THE CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0029)
BEWARE OF MAKING HIS MISTAKE	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0030)
AND STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FADE WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING FLOWER	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0031)
HE IS CALLED AND YOU KNOW THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIES	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0032)

A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS ZAVIOR	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0036)
IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED A DUSK INTO A TAWNY GLOW	(1089-134686-1089-134686-0037)
HE COULD NO LONGER	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0000)
FOR A FULL YEAR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0001)
HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BROOK WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0002)
THE UNIVERSITYS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0003)
PRIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW GRAVES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0004)
WHOSE FEET ARE AS THE FEET OF HEARTS THAT UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0005)
THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD PREFERRED	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0006)
SOON THE OLD BRIDGE WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0007)
THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID FROM THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0008)
ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK HATS AND HUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HIKEY	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0009)
BROTHER MAC CARDELL BROTHER KILOF	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0010)
THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR THOUGHTS AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0011)
IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AND THEMSELVES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0012)
IDLE AND EMBITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE AND TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0013)
THE PHRASES AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN ACCORD	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0014)
WORDS WAS IT THEIR POWERS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0015)
AND THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NOMADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0016)
THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEY AND WOOD BEGIRT AND CITADELED AND OF INTRENCHED AND MARSHALLED RACES	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0017)
AGAIN AGAIN THERE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0018)
A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WALLS WAS CALLING	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0019)
HELLO STEPHANOS HERE COMES THE DAEDAL	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0020)
THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HEWN STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSEPLAY GLEAMED COLD WET LUSTRE	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0021)
HE STOOD STILL IN DEFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BANTER WITH UNEASY WORDS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0022)
IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORDLIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE WRETCHEDNESS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0023)
STEPHANU STEADLOS	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0024)
A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOSTS OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAZE RAPT CITY	(1089-134691-1089-134691-0025)
AND YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITIAN HOLBEIN TURNER AND TINTORET IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0000)
THEY UNITE EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERRING TO THEM AS COLOURISTS SOMETIMES AS CHIOSCURIST	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0001)
BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOUR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CURUSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLOURISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0002)
MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HALLE SIDE BY SIDE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0003)
SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN A TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0004)
IT IS THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPATIUS ONE OF A SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0005)
THEN HE COMES WITH THE BEAK OF IT	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0006)
THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK IS PUT BY THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY DEFINE THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0007)
FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH IT CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0008)
NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS INCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS AND THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEY ARE GRADATED JUSTLY	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0009)
BUT IN THIS VIGNETTE COPIED FROM TURNER I HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0010)
THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAT I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVOURITE CHOICE IN THE TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0011)
IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORIST WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOUR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR SLOW THE VIRTUE IS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0012)
IT MUST REMEMBER BUT ONE OR THE OTHER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0013)
DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL IS AN UNEASY ONE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0014)
THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH A MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0015)
THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE APPROACHING JEWELLER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0016)
THAT A DIE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0017)
IN ALL EARTHLY GOTHIC ART AGAIN YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0018)
THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY THE CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0019)
BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALMOST TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0020)
IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF HEALTH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0021)
YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM AND CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0022)
THE COLOURIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PAROQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0023)
NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR AND THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0024)
YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN FLOWER AND FIRE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0025)
HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOUR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELOUS EFFECTS OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO AND THE PYTHON	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0026)
NOW HERE IS RAPHAEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL A MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0027)
WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNER'S GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORMS AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0028)
ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUDING FIRE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0029)

EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS WAS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHAUCER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0034)
THUS IN CHAUCER'S DREAM'	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0035)
AT BOTH THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOUGH SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0036)
EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHEN SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF HOLBEIN OR DURA	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0037)
BUT NOW HERE'S A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0038)
IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHERESOEVER NO SPECIALITY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0039)
THIS CRAMPNESS AND THE POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0040)
IT IS A GLEANER BRINGING DOWN MY ONE SHEAF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATER MILL ITSELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET ITS STONES TO TURN	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0041)
THE SCHEME IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0042)
SEE THAT YOUR LIVES BE FOR NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED KITE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0043)
IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOINED NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KITES FLY FALCONS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WARWOLF AND THE GEAR EAGLE	(1188-133604-1188-133604-0044)

THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAS ALREADY WORKED US UP	(121-127105-121-127105-0025)
THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED BY THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN	(121-127105-121-127105-0026)
HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCES A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED	(121-127105-121-127105-0027)
THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS BUT THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME	(121-127105-121-127105-0028)
THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GET DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY	(121-127105-121-127105-0029)
I DON'T ANTICIPATE A	(121-127105-121-127105-0030)
SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS AND WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS	(121-127105-121-127105-0031)
YES BUT SHE'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION	(121-127105-121-127105-0032)
IT WAS THE BODY OF IT	(121-127105-121-127105-0033)
IT SOUNDED DULL BUT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS FAINT CONDITION WHICH WAS	(121-127105-121-127105-0034)
SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND AS SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED	(121-127105-121-127105-0035)
BUT WAS THIS ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED	(121-127105-121-127105-0036)
HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS FLICKERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0000)
GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS IN THAT SAME DISHONOURED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOREVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0001)
AS THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0002)
THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT THUS	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0003)
THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0004)
HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE CHARLES WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0005)
THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN A DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0006)
AND HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0007)
MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THAT INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0008)
AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENTS	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0009)
IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLAME OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0010)
BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN A FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0011)
BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO JOIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0012)
POOR WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0013)
PEARLES SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0014)
IF SPOKEN TO HER SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0015)
HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONGST THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0000)
ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND DELICACY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0001)
AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP IN THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0002)
THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHERE A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0003)
WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DARK GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0004)
IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE AND	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0005)
THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE PRESENT IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0006)
BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER OF HER APPEARANCE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0007)
COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD AT US	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0008)
BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH THE VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0009)
SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0010)
IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH LARGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0011)
THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICED WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSED OVER THEM AT NEED	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0012)
LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANT A FREEBORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0013)
YEA HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0014)
YE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP AGAIN	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0015)
WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION OF THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIREST STATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0016)
ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN A FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0017)
LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTESPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREASTPLATE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0018)
MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK YOU	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0019)
IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT ALL	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0020)
PAULE ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FARTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0021)
BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE QUICK STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0022)
THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA AND HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BULL	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0023)
PEARLL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0024)
HE WORE WHITE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEE PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0000)
HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AS A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0001)
INSTEAD OF SHOES THE LITTLE MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0002)
FOR A LONG TIME WE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0003)
WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE LOOKING SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0004)
NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOME EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0005)
AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE ILIKINS THE PATH DIVIDED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0006)
HE KNEW IT COULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0007)
ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAD BROUGHT IN HIS POCKET	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0008)
THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPIT	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0009)
UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOORWAY OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0010)
I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HEART	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0011)
WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PALACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0012)
AND YOU MUST BE O'JO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0013)
OJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL ON ALL HIS LIFE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0014)
WE'RE TRAVELLING RETURNED OJO AND WE STOP AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0015)
THE WOMAN STOOD THOUGHTFUL	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0016)
AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE INTO WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0017)
IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THAT MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0018)
YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOMBA THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0019)
THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED IN OUR GLASS HAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0020)
I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND WILL PROVE OF SOME USE TO US	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0021)
I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0022)
YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC LUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0023)
THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE MAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0024)
I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGOLOT LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0025)
BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEATS AND WASH THE DISHES	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0026)
REALLY THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0027)
A BIG QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0028)
SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND FLOORS ARE SO MIXED UP	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0029)
WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR A SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLOURS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0030)
AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE MY PRINCESS OZMA LIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0031)
I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND THEN SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0032)
OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH HORROR	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0000)
MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCH WORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL THROUGHOUT	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0001)
THE HAIR OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0002)
THE HAIR WAS OF BRIGHT YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0003)
AND GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON MEDAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0004)
NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT HIS BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0005)
WELL THAT MIGHT BE TRUE AGREED MARGOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0006)
SHE POURED UPON THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0007)
I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A BIRD	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0008)

THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOME ONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG HIS PAPERS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0007)
THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD GOT THEM ALL TOGETHER	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0008)
THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAVE OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0009)
I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY BUT LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0010)

THEN THEY TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0028)

IF MISTER SOLMES THOUGHT THEM THE GAME WAS UP	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0050)
IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAVE BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0000)

YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES I'LL SCARCELY SAY MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0009)
AT ANY RATE I SAY GO ON	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0010)
HERE SHE WAS SEEKING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODOURS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0011)
HE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0012)

OH COTTON SHE PAUSED	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0014)

THE GLIMMERING SEA OF BLACK LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0016)
THERE WOULD BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0017)
HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN WHEN SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0018)
COTTONING IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0019)
MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARKS SEEM CALLED FOR	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0020)
I DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LIT'LY BORN IN COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0021)

GOOBLES DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS O VINES BUT ON DE GROUND ON THE ROOTS LIKE YAMS IS THAT SO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0023)

THE HONORABLE JAMES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLEY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0000)
AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE CENTER	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0001)
WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHERS MEN	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0002)
SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKING TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERS	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0003)
AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESTS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TO NIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CRITON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CRITON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE A UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0004)

SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NICHOLAS EDUCATION	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0006)
AND DO YOU BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARY TAYLOR	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0007)
I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED ME	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0008)
BUT CRESWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN AGES	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0009)
THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GREY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDING TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0010)

IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT OVER IT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0001)
O THE SWAMP THE CRUEL SWAMP	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0002)

PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE AWAITING WEEPING	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0010)
HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED IT FORTH SADLY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0011)
HE SPLASHED AND STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BUSHES	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0012)
THEN THEY LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0013)

THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVILY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BOWLS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0015)

HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST DORA	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0019)
THE YEARS TO THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0020)
THE HOPE AND DREAM OF FOREST WAS UPON THE LAND	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0021)
UP IN HIS SICK ROOM ZORA LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0022)
THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DULL SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0023)
FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN THE CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AT SUN AND BIRD AND TREE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0024)
SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARDS WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0025)
SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDER SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND IN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MET HER LOVE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0026)
ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND SO THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0027)
THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT I KNEW	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0028)
HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT LIMPLY MADE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0029)
IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOOR PLANT	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0000)
BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH GOLDEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0001)
FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ALWAYS HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0002)

AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREEN WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0006)
THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS COMPLETE NOW	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0007)
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BEAUTY IN IT AS POSSIBLE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0008)

HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF A GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0010)

THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER NEATNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0012)
HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHEN EVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0013)
THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE MIDDAWS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0014)

MISTER OATLEY' INDEED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0022)
YOU ARE A RARESON FOR SITTING DOWN TO YOUR WORK A LITTLE WHILE AFTER ITS TIME TO PUT BY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0023)

NO NO NOW TOTTY'D GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0028)
DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE STABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0029)
TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WILD SUCKLING PIG	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0030)
THEN SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO AUNT RACHEL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0031)
I OFTEN HEARD THEIR TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0032)
WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH OR YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0033)
AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS OF SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TOWLING AS ISN'T UP	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0034)

I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TODDY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0038)
I'VE STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN THROUGH ANYTHING I'VE DONE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0039)
I DIDN N'T PREACH WITHOUT DIRECTION	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0040)
THEIR DIRECTION	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0041)
I HAD A VERY COMMON PATIENCE WITH YOU	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0042)
BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALLINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT WAS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO COME IN	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0043)
SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH THE STATELY CORDIALITY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0044)
I SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0045)
I DELIGHT IN YOUR GARDEN	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0046)
POYSA IS NOT AT HOME IS HE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0047)
SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGES TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0048)
NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSITURE TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOOL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0049)
SO THERE'S FATHER IN THE BARN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0050)
NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WHELPS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT HIM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0051)
I WILL COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0052)
FOR IF HE'S ANYWHERE ON THE FARM WE CAN SEND HIM IN A MINUTE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0053)
OH SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE HIM AT ALL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0054)
BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM THAN I DO SIR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0055)
I KNOW I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0056)
I KNOW HIS FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN A KINGDOM TO BEAT IT	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0057)
BY THE BYE I'VE EVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY MISSUS POYSER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0058)
THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCES OF HER DAIRY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0059)
OH I'D NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0060)
A PARIS PLANT LIKE THAT AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0000)
THE LATTER PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0001)
THERE MESSRS JOHNSON AND RAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0002)
THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST BUT UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0003)
OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY INTO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0004)
WHY IF WE WRECK A STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0005)
THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT CAN CHANGE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0006)
BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AND THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0007)
EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0008)
FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT VARIOUSLY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0009)
IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD HE CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0010)
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARM HOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGERS WAS AND IS IDEAL	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0011)
EDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT WE COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALVANOMETER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0012)
UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND DECORATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0013)
MISTER WILSON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0014)
HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALSO REGULATOR IN SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0015)
THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINES STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0016)
EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONSTRUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0017)
HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THAT COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0018)
THE STRONG POSITIONS HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0019)
IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSES POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0020)
THIS STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0021)
MEANTIME HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRES SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0022)
I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED OFF	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0023)
BUT A PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0024)
THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVED MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF EDDYSONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0025)
THE ARK LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT A RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0026)
EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GLASS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METRE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0027)
THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACTUAL REGISTRATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0028)
HENCE THE MEDICINE ELECTROLYTIC METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0029)
THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC AND METRE IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0030)
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERINGS AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF COIN OR DAMAGE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0031)
THE STANDARD EDISON METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION OTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0032)
IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS WROTE AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METRE THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0033)
THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN OPERATION ARE TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BASIS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0034)
IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METRE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0035)
THE METRE CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0036)
HE WEIGHED AND REWEIGHED THE METRE PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0037)
HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB SHOULD SUIT HIM BETTER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0038)
THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED IT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0039)
I WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0040)
WE HAD A METERS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0041)
HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF THE OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME	(237-126133-237-126133-0000)
EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WERE SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS	(237-126133-237-126133-0001)
THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN I EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS	(237-126133-237-126133-0002)
SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE WHOLE FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER	(237-126133-237-126133-0003)
IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE PHRONSIE FOR JUST ONE MOVEMENT	(237-126133-237-126133-0004)
OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID VAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY	(237-126133-237-126133-0005)

ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE TO MARY'S OWN	(237-126133-237-126133-0008)
NOW WE'LL STAY CRIED VAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU	(237-126133-237-126133-0009)

ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING DOWN CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE	(237-126133-237-126133-0014)
YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID IT NOW TRULY PHRONSIE	(237-126133-237-126133-0015)
OH NO JAPPY I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF	(237-126133-237-126133-0016)
THERE JAB YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE	(237-126133-237-126133-0017)
DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER TWASN'T HER OWN FAULT	(237-126133-237-126133-0018)
DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO	(237-126133-237-126133-0019)
HOW DID HER MOTHER EVER LET GO	(237-126133-237-126133-0020)
SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE A FATHER	(237-126133-237-126133-0021)
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I TOOK IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY	(237-126133-237-126133-0022)
HE CRIES IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY	(237-126133-237-126133-0023)
AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED A SPACE OF TIME	(237-126133-237-126133-0024)
AT LAST SHE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY	(237-126133-237-126133-0025)

I WISH I HADN'T HEARD SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT	(260-123440-260-123440-0015)
I SHALL BE PUNISHING FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN TEARS	(260-123440-260-123440-0016)

WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET AND YOU DO IT	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0000)
THE CONDITIONS IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0001)
LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON GALLONS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0002)
THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A VERY DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0003)
IT WAS ALL WRITTEN IN LATIN	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0004)
THE WORKER HAD TO BE CONDENSED	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0005)
A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ONGTULATIONS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0006)
MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GOLLATIONS FOR INSTANCE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0007)
IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND ROER PREPARED THAT MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0008)
IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNERS FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0009)
BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THUS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0010)
THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWERS TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE TWO	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0011)
THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOR HIM	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0012)
IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT THOMAS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0000)
THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0001)
HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN FOR CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0002)

DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWNE HIS ENTIRE CHURCH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0005)
AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY AND MINISTRIES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0006)
AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT THIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0007)
PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT FOR HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0008)
PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA I	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0009)
EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLEDS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0010)
PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT EITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0011)
THE MOST THEY COULD COMMAND IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0012)
HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0013)
TO CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0014)
FOR A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGES IS NOT ENOUGH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0015)
THEY SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0016)
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF THE CALL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0017)
I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE TO THE MINISTRY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0018)
I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITHS BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0019)
THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE THIS IS HOLY PRIDE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0020)
AND GOD MY FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0021)
THE CLAUS SEEMED SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0022)
THESE SUBVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0023)
IN THIS WHOLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0024)
BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND OTHER EVIL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0025)
FIRST TWO I	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0026)
TO ALL THE BRETHREN WHICH ARE WITH ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0027)
YOU SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0028)
ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS I GO	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0029)
THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THIS GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0030)
WHY DO I NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0031)
WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTER INTO THE HEART OF MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0032)
NOT ALL THE GALILATIONS HAD BECOME PERVERTED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0033)
THESE MEANS DO NOT BE CONTAMINATED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0034)
THEY REMAINED DIVINED REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0035)
WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST RAINS THERE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0036)
SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE AND NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0037)
GRACE BE TO YOU AS PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0038)
THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW TOO WELL UNDERSTOOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0039)
THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS REFRESHING OH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0040)
GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS THE PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0041)
THE WORLD LANDS THIS A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0042)
THAT EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0043)
HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GODS WILL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0044)
MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0045)
WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO ASK FROM GOD THE FATHER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0046)
TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE TRAGEDY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0047)
HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG THE MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0048)
EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF LIFE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0049)
DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER OR BY ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0050)
WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION HE MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0051)
WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHERS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0052)
AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONDEMNS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0053)
THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO THEM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0054)
TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PRACTICE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0055)
OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD A FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0056)
THE ARIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN OR EARTH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0057)
M MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0058)
BUT PAUL STICKS TO HIS THEME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0059)
HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLE AND	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0060)
NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASSHA LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0061)
NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESSES BUT FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0062)
UNDERSCORE ARE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0063)
SO MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0064)
PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST OR THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0065)
SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVING FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0066)
THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES THEIR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0067)
THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE LOVE OF GOD INDICATES THIS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0068)
THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR HER SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0069)
BUT THEY ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0070)
WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT HE CAN DISMISS SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0071)
THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD TO SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0072)
THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BECAUSE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0073)
THIS ATTITUDE IS UNUSUAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0074)
BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS ARE LOST UPON THEM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0075)
ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD IT AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0076)
HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT THE FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE	(2961-960-2961-960-0000)
THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO HIS MISUNDERSTANDING	(2961-960-2961-960-0001)
IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEOLOTINISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CONNECTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO	(2961-960-2961-960-0002)
THEY WERE ABSORBED IN THIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL	(2961-960-2961-960-0003)
THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEOPLATONIST	(2961-960-2961-960-0004)
ON THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT	(2961-960-2961-960-0005)
THE FANCIES OF THE NEOPLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT THE PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY	(2961-960-2961-960-0006)
BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN ITS SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM	(2961-960-2961-960-0007)
WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY DIRECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND	(2961-960-2961-960-0008)
THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND OF MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS	(2961-960-2961-960-0009)
BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINES AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL	(2961-960-2961-960-0010)
WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE ANXAGORRIS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER	(2961-960-2961-960-0011)
MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRISOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS	(2961-960-2961-960-0012)
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THESE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE	(2961-960-2961-960-0013)
THE IDEA ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES	(2961-960-2961-960-0014)
THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFERED GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES	(2961-960-2961-960-0015)
BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE FIDRES OR SYMPOSIUM	(2961-960-2961-960-0016)
NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED CHARACTER	(2961-960-2961-960-0017)
BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND HIS DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP	(2961-960-2961-960-0018)
HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREAT LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA	(2961-960-2961-960-0019)
AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATA WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS	(2961-960-2961-960-0020)
THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIEST WRITINGS	(2961-960-2961-960-0021)
PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH MIGHT HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART	(2961-960-2961-960-0022)
SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPLE	(2961-961-2961-961-0000)
AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT TROUBLE	(2961-961-2961-961-0001)
AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITUS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE	(2961-961-2961-961-0002)
I WILL IF TIMAEUS APPROVES I HOPE	(2961-961-2961-961-0003)
LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SALIS WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF TROPIDUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME	(2961-961-2961-961-0004)
SOME POEMS OF CALON WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS	(2961-961-2961-961-0005)
AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEM SAY THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK	(2961-961-2961-961-0006)
THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED	(2961-961-2961-961-0007)
WHEN THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS	(2961-961-2961-961-0008)
TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SALIN HEARD THIS STORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0009)
BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN THEIR TEMPLES	(2961-961-2961-961-0010)
THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNALS SALIN ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0011)
FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAS THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN	(2961-961-2961-961-0012)
SALEN MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS	(2961-961-2961-961-0013)
NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND NINE THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED OURS AS OUR ANNALS RECORD	(2961-961-2961-961-0014)
MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPARTS OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME	(2961-961-2961-961-0015)
I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THAT ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS	(2961-961-2961-961-0016)
OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE THE LAW TOOK IN THAT PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN	(2961-961-2961-961-0017)
THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE FAMILY OF ATLANTIS	(2961-961-2961-961-0018)
FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE OTHER HELLENES HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS BEHIND THE PILLARS	(2961-961-2961-961-0019)
THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN A PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN	(2961-961-2961-961-0020)
BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED IT TO REFRESH MY MEMORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0021)
THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LAST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORDS SPOKE	(2961-961-2961-961-0022)
BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAS BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0000)
THE UTILITY OF SUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0001)
SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUAL LABOUR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0002)
WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS TABOO MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLY CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABOO OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0003)
IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONGING TO THE LEISURE CLASS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0004)
AFTER THE TABOO CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0005)
DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCES	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0006)
IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR MENTAL	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0007)
THIS CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0008)
WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS OF MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0009)
THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA WAS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0010)
THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATING IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0011)
THERE IS THE MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK AND GRATES	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0012)
THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH IN THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0013)
MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY IN ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0014)
SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS WITHOUT QUALIFICATION	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0015)
MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMERS IN THE HOUSES OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0016)
THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR OF LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0017)
THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO THREE CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0018)
BUT THE MORAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0019)
SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LABOR CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0020)
WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LABOR EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONORIFIC CHARACTER	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0021)
THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE DESIRED TO WEAR IT	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0022)
IN THE GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0000)
THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS WITH WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0001)
BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVES UPON THE WIFE ALONE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0002)
IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0003)
IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCED IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES THROUGH THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0004)
THE MAN OF A HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0005)
VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PAID AWAY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0006)
THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURES OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0007)
THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE FUNCTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0008)
EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE IT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0009)
THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALTOGETHER BY ANOTHER LINE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0010)
IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE FIRST TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0011)
IT WAS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0012)
CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE CITY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0013)
AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF ENGLAND GOSSIPS SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0014)
THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PLANTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0015)
UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM IN THE OUTSET	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0000)
BUT THE NATURAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE CORSA PEACEABLE CULTURE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0001)
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOUR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND IN WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0002)

AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERY DAY LIFE THIS WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0006)

AND IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0008)
IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE BY SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0009)

TO THAT FERVENT LATTER DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR A RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0010)

BE IT SAID TO THE HONOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH THAT TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNT ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGN THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0016)
OH WHAT A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE EFFECT	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0017)
AMERICAN SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ABBAGGINZES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH THE PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE VAUDOIS HUNTED OR HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE	(4077-13751-4077-13751-0018)

ALREADY A NORTHERN AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF WHY NOT SET UP ALSO A WEST	(4077-13754-4077-13754-0004)

THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND INITIATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL ESTATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAID IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY	(4077-13754-4077-13754-0015)

ANOTHER SACRIFICE WAS MOST REMARKABLE	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0014)
TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM DEPTH OF FROM FOUR TO FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH A SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SITE OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRACED LIKE THE SEATS OF AN AMPHITHEATRE	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0015)
YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALGERIA AS YOU IMAGINED IT	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0016)

THIS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARREN OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0018)
NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN IN DISAPPOINTMENT FROM THE NORTH	(5105-28241-5105-28241-0019)

AND WYLDER LAUGHED TOO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOUR OF THE JOKE SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES ON LEE BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DOROTHY ONLY REMARKING	(5683-32865-5683-32865-0012)

HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANY MORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE FLOWERS	(672-122797-672-122797-0023)
THE APPROACH WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE	(672-122797-672-122797-0024)
THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT THE ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS	(672-122797-672-122797-0025)

BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND THERE IN A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAY LIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM	(672-122797-672-122797-0042)
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE TEA	(672-122797-672-122797-0043)
AND HE LEANED AGAINST THIS WALL LOST IN REVERIE	(672-122797-672-122797-0044)
TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOMETHING DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY	(672-122797-672-122797-0045)

I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE LADY	(672-122797-672-122797-0054)
AND THEN HE TOLD ALL OF HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LISTENED AND SAID	(672-122797-672-122797-0055)
SAID THE FIR TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF REMARKED	(672-122797-672-122797-0056)

DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BACON AND TALLOW CANDLES CAN'T YOU FIND ANY LARDER STORIES	(672-122797-672-122797-0061)
NO CRIED THE TREE	(672-122797-672-122797-0062)
THEN GOOD BYE SAID THE RAS AND THEY WENT HOME	(672-122797-672-122797-0063)
AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALMOST AND THE TREE SIGHED AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN THE SLEEK LITTLE MICE SAT ROUND ME AND LISTENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM	(672-122797-672-122797-0064)
NOW THAT TOO IS OPEN	(672-122797-672-122797-0065)
WHY THE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT	(672-122797-672-122797-0066)
THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAND WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE	(672-122797-672-122797-0067)
BUT IT WAS NOT THIS FIR TREE THAT THEY MEANT	(672-122797-672-122797-0068)
IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG SOME WEEDS AND NETTLES	(672-122797-672-122797-0069)
THE GOLDEN STAR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOPS OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE	(672-122797-672-122797-0070)
IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MERRITH CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM	(672-122797-672-122797-0071)

HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE HUNG THE STORY AT AN END	(672-122797-672-122797-0074)

YOU CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0002)
IT WAS A BITTER THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0003)
BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROVED A MERE BLUFF	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0004)
HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE WE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0005)
IF THAT PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGED CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0006)

AND I'LL PAY ALL THE COSTS BESIDES	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0045)
THEY'RE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0046)
I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARCHELL	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0047)
GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGED CHECK AND QUASH FURTHER PROCEEDING	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0048)
HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRES TO HELP YOUNG GATES	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0049)
BETH UNEASY AT HIS SILENCE TRUDGED HIM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0050)
THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SHRILL FACE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0051)
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHEQUE FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE HAD BEEN SHARP	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0052)
AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVED ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0053)

THE WEAK NEED CONTINGENCY SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM OPPOSITION	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0002)
THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED ON A WAY TO DO THIS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0003)
UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS REYNOLDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO COLLECT HOPKINS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0004)
THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH REYNOLDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALITY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0005)
AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH STOPPED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE BUGGY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0006)
THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION OF THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0007)

TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIAL REPAST IS TO BE SERVED	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0011)
THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WERE THE NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESTS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0012)

SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS THE ESPECIAL FAVORITE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0016)
THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BERT FOLLOWED	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0017)

THEY ATTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD MENDING YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR THE LINEN	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0022)
YOU LOOK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE IS YOUR HOME	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0023)
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID LOOKED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITOR	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0024)
SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROCKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SO SORRY SAID BETH	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0025)

SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMUSING AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0028)
BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELIZA SURPASSED HER A NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0029)
HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM DELIVERANCE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0030)
THEIR EYES WANDERED TO THE MAID'S HANDS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0031)
HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORM MIGHT COMPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0032)
SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT BADE HER VISITOR CATCH HER BREATH	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0033)
I WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE CRIES FIERCELY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0034)
AND WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0035)
ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0036)

AND CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS EVERYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0002)
FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN WHO GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UNHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCE	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0003)

THE SCOUT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0005)

IT IS YOU WHO ARE MISTAKEN RAOUL I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION A WHOLE DAY	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0009)
I CAN PERCEIVE THE LOVE CLEARLY ENOUGH	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0010)
I AM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE COUNSEL	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0011)
IT IS AN ANOYANCE THEN	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0012)
IN THOSE VERY THINGS I EVEN ADDED MORE	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0013)
AND CONTINUED RAOUL NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AND INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0014)

YES I NEED REPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE SUGGESTED ME TO DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0016)
BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE RAW COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT ETERNAL CONFLICT	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0017)
THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLIT AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY HOWEVER	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0018)
UPON THE LARGE SQUARES IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGSTONES	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0019)
BRAGELONNE WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVIL SLUMBERS OF MANI KEMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLENT SUIT	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0020)
GOLIATH IS ANOTHER DISCOVERY	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0000)
HE WERE CERTAINLY NO NEARER THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0001)
THEY POOR LITTLE THINGS CRIED CYNTHIA THINK OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0002)
WELL WHAT IS THE SENSE OF IT TWO INNOCENT BABIES LIKE THAT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0003)
BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT DOWN HER BUNDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACED HER COMPANION	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0004)
HIS TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICTURE TO THE WALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0005)
HERS APPEARED TO BE ON THE SAME FRAME TOO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0006)
NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHIA SPRACHE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0007)
I THOUGHT WE WERE STOOPED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE BUT IT'S BEEN OF SOME USE AFTER ALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0008)
DO YOU SUPPOSE HER MINIATURE WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0009)
OH WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT QUERIED JOYCE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0010)
IT'S WORRY ME TERRIBLY AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEME SIN	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0011)
WE'LL COME IN HERE THIS AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOTHES UPON AND HAVE A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0012)
IT CAN'T HELP ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0013)
THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PEER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0014)
SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PARAPHERNALIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUST PAN TO THEIR OUTFIT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0015)
THE LURE PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A YOUNG KITTEN AND MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0016)
OH LET HIM COME AROUND SHE URGED I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0017)
HE MAKES THAT SORT OF COSIER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0018)
NOW LET'S DUST THEIR FURNITURE AND PICTURES	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0019)
YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE THE VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0020)
SURFACE DUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS NEW ELEGANCE AND POLISH	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0021)
THEN SHE SUDDENLY RETURNED	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0022)
AND MY POCKET MONEY'S GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0023)
I SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLE LIGHT IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0024)
OH IT'S GOLIATH AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING IN	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0025)
ISN'T HE THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO ODD NUMBERS	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0026)
FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND SCURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON ADDITIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0027)
WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSES MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0028)
NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WERE INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0000)
I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW KAFFIR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE FOR I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0001)
ONWARD SAID A DISTANCE VOICE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0002)
NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF HER NIGHT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0003)
THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAVE BEEN SAID	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0004)
WHATEVER WAS THAT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0005)
WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY IN THE SURFACE OF THE POND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0006)
NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE RIDGES TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0007)
IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE LAND OF DEATH	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0008)
I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH A PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS A KAFIR	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0009)
A SOUND OF THE VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0010)
A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE FOR	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0011)
SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNISED AS VOLTAIRE'S KAFFRE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0012)
I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0013)
INTO THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLOURED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0014)
I DO NOT KNOW NO I AM DAZED BEWILDERED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0015)
BUT THAT'S KAFFIR'S KNIFE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0016)
I KNOW HE HAD THAT VERY EVENING	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0017)
I REMEMBERED SAYING IF WE BEEN TOGETHER	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0018)
VOLTAIRE PUSHED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0019)
I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0020)
ONE TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0021)
I HAD NOW BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0022)
PERCHANCE TOO KAFFIR'S BREATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0023)
MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH WAS LEFT ME	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0024)
MY POSITION WAS TOO DIFFICULT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0025)
MY OVERWROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST AND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0026)
FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTANTLY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0027)
THE SMALL MODES OF MANAGEMENT	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0000)
TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT WAS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0001)
BY REASON AND EDUCATION	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0002)
AS THE CHAISE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE MASTER DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENTS AND VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0003)
THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHAISE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSIONS OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0004)
SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD LITTLE GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0005)
THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE PERSON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0006)
IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE WERE GONE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0007)
BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL MAKE ANY TROUBLE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0008)
IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION SHALL NOT BE OVERRATED	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0009)
TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY DIFFICULT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0000)
DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A PEASANT WHOSE NAME WAS JANE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0001)
NOW DELIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDENCY OVER THE MINDS OF HER CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0002)
TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THEIR CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0003)
YOU HAVE COME ANDELLA AND DELLA WAS THE NAME OF KATE'S DOLL TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0004)
I AM VERY HAPPY	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0005)
I EXPECT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL ANDELLA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0006)
NOW TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0007)
FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLACKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0008)
THEY WAS NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOR	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0009)
DELIA CAME TO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSALIE HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO HIM	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0010)
SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ON BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0011)
SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHINGS AND SEE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0012)
PUT THESE PLAYTHINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING OF YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0013)
AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT TO ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0014)
NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY NEW IMPRESSIONS	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0000)
NO THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0001)
THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED INTO COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0002)
VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THESE MENTAL FURNISHING	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0003)
WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE IN REFLECTION HOW VAST AN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0004)
THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT A MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0005)
BUT ASERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0000)
HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT HEERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0001)
HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED HIS JACKKNIFE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0002)
NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND THEERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKKNIFE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0003)
YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDARS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0004)
SEEING THAT I AM SO THIN I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0005)
I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED PETERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0006)
AND SHE TOOK ANDERSON'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0007)
FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE FACE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0008)
AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN THE LONG ROWS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0009)
ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN THE GLITTERING DECANTERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0010)
THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET ANDINGER SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0011)
BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH A CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0012)
THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HER MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0013)
HE ONLY SHOWED HIS HEAD	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0014)
WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN ON HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0015)
THAT IS THE VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0016)
SO IT IS SAID ALLERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0017)
AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARNS AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0018)
WITH ONE JUMP AND SO GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0019)
HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE GARDEN	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0020)
HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH ARMS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0021)
AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ABOUT AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0022)
BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS VERY STUPID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0023)
AND HERE'S FACE GREW RED	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0024)
AS HIS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0025)
NO MY LITTLE FRIENDS SHE SAID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0026)
WHEN YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0027)
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THAT COURT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0000)
AH VERY MUCH	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0001)
LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AU COURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE PRINCE HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0002)
GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT ANN AND VILLEROIS TOOK THEIR LEAVE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0003)
CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT ONE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0004)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LUCY	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0005)
SHE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0006)
IT IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWNED	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0007)
DOES YOUR MAJESTY THERE NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYAL ATTEMPT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0008)

BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAS NO RENDING CLAWS	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0003)
BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMORANT IT SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0004)
ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY ON HIS PERCH	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0005)
IT MIGHT BE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0006)
BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS ENGORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT IN THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0007)
IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO SHORT	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0008)
THE GREAT HULK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO RETRIEVE THEIR PREY FROM THE GROUND	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0009)
THE CAT GROANED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE IN HER JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0010)

THE HAWK ALIGHTED IN THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0012)
LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HORSE SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0013)
THE HAWK SAT UPON THIS BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0014)
ALMOST INSTANTLY HE WAS ROUSED TO THE TOP	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0015)
STRAIGHTWAY THIS HAWK GLIDED FROM HIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0016)
BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO STAY DOWN	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0017)
BUT THIS FREQUENTER OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MIGHTY RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0018)
AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD BELOW THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0019)
WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SINK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0020)
BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS READY TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0021)
THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR CONCEIVED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0022)
HE HAD A LOT OF MINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CASTE BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0023)

AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING IN THE BANK	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0025)
THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHAIN UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0026)
THEN THE LEADER PARTED FROM THEIR LINE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0027)

INDEED IRRESOLUTION BEING THE KEYNOTE OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SINGLE WORKING OF THE JAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEANING	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0012)
WE MODERNS HOWEVER KNOW THE ABSURDITY OF IT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0013)

THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED AND STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0000)
AMONG THE OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF MURCHESTON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0001)
THOUGH THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0002)
THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSE'S COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NOTHING BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE IN SCOTLAND	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0003)
FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN RELIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCOE WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0004)
DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWERS OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLEY AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0005)
THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ACCEPT HIM	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0006)
ON QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0007)
WITH THESE AND SOME REINFORCEMENTS OF THE ATHOLMEN AND MACDONALDS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0008)
THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INNER LOCHY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0009)
BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNERLOTE AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTED COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0010)
HIS OWN CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED CONSPICUOUS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0011)
MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT AND WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0012)
FROM THAT SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD RELY ON	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0013)
BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMITTEES AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0014)
THOUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MERE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0015)
VALOR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONSULTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0016)
HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANYTHING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINE SUCCESS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0017)
HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW ON THIS HILL	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0000)
THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOURS OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0001)
THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THAT UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0002)
OR HATH SHE GIVEN US ANY GIFT	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0003)
AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE MANY PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YOU WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0004)
ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG OUT	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0005)
THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THIS WORDS	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0006)
HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR IT	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0007)
THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO HIS MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0008)
THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROVISIONS BEFORE THE KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0009)
BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0010)
THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL A INTEREST TO DISCUSS	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0011)
IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCOR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT OCCUPIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0012)
HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PERFECT MISFORTUNE	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0013)
THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0000)
WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELINGS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0001)
WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE SHOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0002)
AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY PROBABLE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0003)
THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT DEMANDED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0004)
ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TUNABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT APPEARS WHEN WE REMEMBER	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0005)
THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOR HAS HAD TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0006)
HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIORIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT MAY ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0007)
BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCES IS WARRANTED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0008)
OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AS COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0009)
WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY GRAVE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0010)
SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY SIMILAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0011)
THIS FAMILIARITY IS A FEELING CAPABLE OF DEGREES	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0012)
AND AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0013)
I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MAY HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0014)
THEY MUST HAVE HAD SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0015)
IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME INDIVIDUAL EVENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0016)
THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE REMEDY IS CONCERNED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0017)
THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF A REMEMBERED EVENTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0018)
IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESSES OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0019)
IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE TROUBLE OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0020)
REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS RELATED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0021)
SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE TO	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0022)
IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER EASY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0023)
THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLY DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0024)
WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE TROUBLE WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMEDIACY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0025)
THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY FOR IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0026)
A GRAMMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0027)
I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABITS THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0028)
THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DO NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0029)
SYMONDS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL SO CLOSELY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0030)
THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO THEIR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0031)
IT IS THUS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0032)
IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALTHOUGH EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0033)
WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO A JUDGEMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0034)
THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE LAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0035)
A FURTHER STAGE IS THIS RECOGNITION	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0036)
RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNISE IN THE CAT OF THE MOVEMENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0037)
WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNISE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION OF THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0038)
THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH OF ANOTHER IT IS NOT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0039)
