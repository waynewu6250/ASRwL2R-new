THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER GONE	(121-127105-121-127105-0026)
HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND OF THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED	(121-127105-121-127105-0027)
THE OPPOSITE THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME	(121-127105-121-127105-0028)
THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP HIM BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY	(121-127105-121-127105-0029)
I DON'T ANTICIPATE HER	(121-127105-121-127105-0030)
SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS STUDIES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS	(121-127105-121-127105-0031)
YES BUT THAT'S JUST HER BEAUTY OF HER PASSION	(121-127105-121-127105-0032)
OH IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT	(121-127105-121-127105-0033)
IT SOUNDED DULL BUT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MAIN CONDITION WHICH IT WAS	(121-127105-121-127105-0034)
SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN WE FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED	(121-127105-121-127105-0035)
BUT WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASK	(121-127105-121-127105-0036)
HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMEN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0000)
GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOREVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SON IN HEAVEN	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0001)
YET THESE THOUGHTS CAUSED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0002)
THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST WITH THOUGHTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0003)
THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DOES NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0004)
HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PAUL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIALS OF EARTH	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0005)
THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC IN THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0006)
HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITIES	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0007)
MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALLY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0008)
AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARLE MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0009)
IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER EARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0010)
BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE IN EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0011)
BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORK THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0012)
PEARLS WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0013)
PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE A ACQUAINTANCE	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0014)
IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT THINK AGAIN	(1221-135766-1221-135766-0015)
HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASIONS OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0000)
ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HECTOR AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0001)
AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSICK WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0002)
THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0003)
WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIGOROUS TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0004)
IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH THE LIFE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0005)
THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY DRAWN OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0006)
BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER AND HER APPEARANCE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0007)
COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD AT ME	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0008)
BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THAT KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0009)
SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH NEVERTHELESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0010)
IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO OR NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0011)
THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICED WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER HIM AT NEED	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0012)
LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNES GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0013)
YEA HIS HONOURABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE AS LEECH	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0014)
YE MAY NOT SEE THEIR WORSHIP NOW	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0015)
WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED A NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIREST STATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0016)
ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHLY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0017)
LITTLE PEARLIE WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTISPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREASTPLATE	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0018)
MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOKING	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0019)
IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND THIS	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0020)
PEARLE ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FARTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPTS AT SHRUBBERY	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0021)
BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THAT SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0022)
THERE WAS A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BULL	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0023)
PEARLO SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED	(1221-135767-1221-135767-0024)
HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEEPATS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0000)
HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN OF A FLAT BRIM AND ROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0001)
INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH A TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0002)
FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LANDS OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0003)
WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNC SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND WALKED UP THE PATH	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0004)
NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSEHOLD EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0005)
AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE YULIKINS THE PATH DIVIDED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0006)
HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE EM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0007)
ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0008)
THEN THEY STARTED IN AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0009)
UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THEIR VISITORS WITH A SMILE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0010)
I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HELP	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0011)
WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONEER PLACE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0012)
AND THEN YOU MUST BE OJO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0013)
OJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL ITS LIFE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0014)
YOU'RE TRAVELLING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOP AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0015)
THE WOMAN IS THOUGHTFUL	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0016)
AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING IN A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0017)
IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM KEEPING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0018)
YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOMBI THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COMPANY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0019)
THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS MAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0020)
I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF ANY USE TO US	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0021)
I'M AFRAID THAT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0022)
YOU SEE I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC NUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0023)
THAT WAS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0024)
I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU OUR PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGOLOTTE LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0025)
BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR THE SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0026)
YET THAT TAX WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0027)
A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SOWED TOGETHER	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0028)
SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND POCKETS ARE SO MIXED UP	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0029)
WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT WAS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0030)
AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE MY PRINCESS OZMA LIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOUR	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0031)
I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A BIG JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS	(1284-1180-1284-1180-0032)
OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE AND WONDER	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0000)
MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S ROOM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL THROUGHOUT	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0001)
THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HIS	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0002)
THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL DEEP BRAIDS	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0003)
GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON MEDAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFTER AND PLIABLE	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0004)
NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE MAN	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0005)
WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SLAVE WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0006)
SHE POURED IT INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0007)
I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED OF A SERVANT	(1284-1181-1284-1181-0008)

I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS FEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0001)
MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BANKR STREET	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0002)

THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOME MAN HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0007)
THE ROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0008)
THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE FLOWERS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0009)
I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I GAVE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0010)
A BROKEN PIN OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0011)

AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOLMES FOR I ENTERED BY THE DOOR	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0026)
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE PROJECTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0027)
THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT ONE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0028)
HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH MIGHT TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0029)

HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HALLOCK WHAT IS THIS	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0035)
HOLMES HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM INTO THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0036)
WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AS HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0037)
I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING THIS DOOR YES THERE ARE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0038)

I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT YET OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0044)
AND HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE	(1580-141083-1580-141083-0045)

HE WAS PACING SWIFTLY UP OR DOWN HIS ROOM	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0001)
THE SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THAT COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0002)
NO NAME'S PLEASE SAID HOLMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GILCRIST'S DOOR	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0003)

THE FOUL MOUTHED FELLOW AT THAT TOP	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0012)

LOOK AT THAT HE HELD OFF HIS HAND	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0020)
ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PYRAMIDS OF WHITE DOUGHY CLAY	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0021)
AND ON MORE THIS MORNING	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0022)
IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AS HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0023)
HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT HAVE COME	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0024)
YOU KNOW HIM I THINKS SO	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0025)
IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PUBLIC COURT MARTIAL	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0026)
YOU SIR CERTAINLY NOT	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0027)
THERE THERE WAS NO MAN SIR	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0028)
HIS TERRIBLE BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANNISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0029)
OH JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOLMES	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0030)
WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GILCREST HOW YOU AN HONORABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH A ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0031)

WHEN I TOUCHED YOUR ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0037)

I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE CONTENTS OF THE SIDE TABLE	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0039)
HE HAD RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU ARE AWARE WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0040)
NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE BELIEVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0041)

HE PUT THIS SHOES ON THE TABLE	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0043)
GLOVERS SAID THE YOUNG MAN	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0044)
SUDDENLY HE FELT HIM AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0045)

IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF HE ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0049)
IF MISTER SOLMES HEARD THEM THE GAME WAS UP	(1580-141084-1580-141084-0050)
IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH TRUE ENTHUSIASM	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0000)
THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON NEW ORLEANS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0001)
JOHN TAYLOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN CONTENT	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0002)
YOU BETTER GO HE HAD COUNSELLED SENTENTIOUSLY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0003)

SOME OTHERS TOO TO BIG COTTON COUNTY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0008)
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES I'LL SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN PLACE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0009)
AT ANY RATE I SAY WELL	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0010)
HERE SHE IS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODOURS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0011)
SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THOSE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0012)
SO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TO DAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE RAIN BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE BOTTOMS	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0013)
YOU COTTON SHE PAUSED	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0014)
SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TOUCHES SIGHT	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0015)
THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DUSK LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0016)
THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS CASE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0017)
HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STOCKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0018)
COTTON IS A WONDERFUL LITTLE THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0019)
MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARK THAT SEEMED CALLED FOR	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0020)
DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LIT'RILY BORN IN COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0021)
I S'POSE NOW IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0022)
GOOBIS DON'T GROW ON DE TOPS OF VINES BUT ON DE GROUND ON DE ROOTS LIKE YAMS IS THAT SO	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0023)
THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HEARK	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0024)
SOME TIME YE'LL TELL ME PLEASE WON'T YOU	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0025)
NOW FOR THE ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTON	(1995-1826-1995-1826-0026)
THE HONOURABLE CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLIE'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0000)
AT LAST THE CANNON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0001)
WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER PEOPLE	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0002)
SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE AN INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERS	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0003)
AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESTS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TONIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CRIFTON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CRITON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0004)
MISSUS GREY HAD MET THE SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0005)
AND SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0006)
DO YOU BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATIONS ASKED MARY TAYLOR	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0007)
I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF THAT PEOPLE TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0008)
BUT CRESWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY THAT CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACES	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0009)
THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GREY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE WHAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0010)
NOT POSITIVELY HEROIC ADDED CRESWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0011)
BUT WE'RE NOT ER EXACTLY WELCOME TO	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0012)
MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED A TALE OF ZORA TO MISSUS GRAY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0013)
FOR FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS	(1995-1836-1995-1836-0014)
HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS AND ZORATAS MUST BE RUINED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0000)
IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE MOUNTAIN ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT ROUND IT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0001)
AH AH THE SWAMP THE CRUEL SWAMP	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0002)
THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDERS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0003)
HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND NOT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0004)
SHE WAS SO STRANGE AND EAGER A CREATURE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0005)
THE WORLD WAS ONCE WATER VEILED IN MISTS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0006)
THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT DOWN HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STEAMED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0007)
WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING IT	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0008)
THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DIKES A WEEK AGO AND NOW THE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0009)
PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING OR WEEPING	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0010)
HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT FOR HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0011)
HE SPLASHED AND STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THAT CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0012)
THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS QUIET	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0013)
HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHING UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0014)
THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TWO BOWLS	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0015)
FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST A CHAIR	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0016)
HE GAZED ABOUT HER PERPLEXED ASTONISHED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0017)
HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAINS SOME ONE HAD DUG A CANAL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CRACK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0018)
HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT UPPERMOST	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0019)
THE YEARS AFTER THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0020)
THE HOPE AND DREAM OF BREAKFAST WAS UPON THE LAND	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0021)
UP IN THE SECOND ROOM ZORA LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0022)
THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SUCH MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0023)
FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN A CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AT SUN AND BIRD AND TREE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0024)
SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWLS AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0025)
SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND IN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MET HER LOVE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0026)
ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL PEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LO THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0027)
THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW A	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0028)
HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES THEN PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE	(1995-1837-1995-1837-0029)
IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOORP PLACE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0000)
BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE DOOR IT IS NEVER OPENED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0001)
FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PACK	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0002)

AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WALL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0004)
SEVERAL CLOTHESHORSES A PILLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLOURED RAGS	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0005)
AT THE EDGE OF THIS BASE THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0006)
THE HISTORY OF THE PLACE IS PLAIN NOW	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0007)
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS RUSHING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0008)

HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS IN THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0010)
DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY OF FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAVEN LIGHT FOOTED	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0011)
THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MOTHER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0012)
HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAVE LEFT OFF	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0013)
THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WITDAWS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0014)
TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKIN TIME	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0015)

DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS A TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0029)
TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CARRIAGE WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0030)
AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO AUNT SARAH	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0031)
I OFTEN HEARD HER TALKS OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0032)
WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KINDLY HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0033)

I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU SAW LITTLE TOTTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0038)
I'VE STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING YOU'VE DONE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0039)

TO DIRECTION	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0041)
I HAD A COMMON APPEARANCE WITH YOU	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0042)
BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT IS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO COME IN	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0043)
SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS SISTERLY CORDIALITY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0044)
OH OH SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0045)
I DELIGHTS IN YOUR KITCHEN	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0046)
POYSER IS NOT AT HOME SAYS HE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0047)
SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE BEYOND THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0048)
NO SIR HE ISN'T AND HE'S GONE TO ROSSITUR TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOOL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0049)
BUT IT'S FATHER IN THE BARN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0050)
NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WHELPS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH OUR SHEPHERD	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0051)
I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT BOOKS	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0052)
FOR IF HE'S ANYWHERES ON THE FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0053)
OH SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE ME AT ALL	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0054)
IF YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO SIR	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0055)
I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0056)
I KNOW HIS FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US BUT AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0057)
BY THE BY I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY AND I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY MISSUS POYSER	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0058)
THEN MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0059)
OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDERS	(2094-142345-2094-142345-0060)
THE PARIS PLANT LIKE THAT AT A CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0000)
THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND HAMS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0001)
THERE MESSRS JOHNSON AND HAMOUR PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0002)
THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTUAL USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0003)
OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE AND DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0004)
WHY IF WE ARREST A STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0005)
THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT THIS WILL CHANGE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0006)
BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AND THE GATE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0007)
EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATIONS OF CULTURE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0008)
FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASONS WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0009)
IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY IN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0010)
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS UPON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARMHOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0011)
EDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT THEY COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALVANOMETER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0012)
UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND REGULATED AS THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0013)
MISTER EDISON WAS A LEADER FAR HEAD OF THE TIME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0014)
HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTIONING BRAKE ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0015)
THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING BUT MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0016)
EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIT TWO WIRES SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0017)
HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING AND FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0018)
THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT IS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0019)
IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED TO A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0020)
THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD PO LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0021)
MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED ON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRES SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0022)
I THINK I WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0023)
BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION OF THIS COUNTRY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0024)
THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF EDISSONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0025)
THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATES FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0026)
EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MIGHT BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0027)
THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THIS SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANY THING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0028)
HENCE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXTERNAL QUALITIES	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0029)
THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METRE IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMIC SUBSTANCE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0030)
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OBSERVATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERINGS AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0031)
THE STANDARD EDISON METEOR PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0032)
IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METRE THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0033)
THE OTHERS HAVING HAD BEEN IN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BASIS	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0034)
IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METAL	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0035)
THE METRES CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0036)
HE WEIGHED AND RE WEIGHED THE METER PLATES AND PERCEIVED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0037)
HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KINDS OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0038)
OF THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0039)
HE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0040)
WE HAD METRES OF WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID	(2300-131720-2300-131720-0041)
HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING IN THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME	(237-126133-237-126133-0000)
EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND THROUGH THE FLOWERS	(237-126133-237-126133-0001)
THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU WILL BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS	(237-126133-237-126133-0002)

ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S HEAD	(237-126133-237-126133-0014)
YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID THAT NOW TRULY PHRONSIE	(237-126133-237-126133-0015)
OH NO STAPSER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF	(237-126133-237-126133-0016)
THERE JAF YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE	(237-126133-237-126133-0017)
DO DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER TWASN'T HER FAULT	(237-126133-237-126133-0018)
DEAR DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO	(237-126133-237-126133-0019)

I DID N'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY	(237-126133-237-126133-0022)
HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE BUTTERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY	(237-126133-237-126133-0023)
AND THE OLD OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME	(237-126133-237-126133-0024)
AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPE HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY	(237-126133-237-126133-0025)

THE FEATHER IF WE MAY USE THE TERM WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG	(260-123288-260-123288-0001)
THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPOURS PERVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF THE SAILING WATERS	(260-123288-260-123288-0002)

ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF ALAMANTE AND SAINT AUBEL'S FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF LEAD	(260-123288-260-123288-0010)
BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE A SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF A TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT	(260-123288-260-123288-0011)
THAT WILL BE THE SAFEST OH NO NEVER	(260-123288-260-123288-0012)

HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOMES LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS	(260-123440-260-123440-0010)

IT'LL BE NO USE THEIR PUTTING THEIR HEAD DOWN AND SAYING COME UP AGAIN DEAR	(260-123440-260-123440-0012)
I AM SO FAR TIRED OF BEING ALL ALONE HERE	(260-123440-260-123440-0013)
OR I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD THAT IT IS	(260-123440-260-123440-0014)
I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SIGHED ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT	(260-123440-260-123440-0015)
I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NO I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN TEARS	(260-123440-260-123440-0016)
THAT IT WILL BE A QUEER THING TO BE SURE	(260-123440-260-123440-0017)
BUT I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE OH MOUSE	(260-123440-260-123440-0018)
CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED HER	(260-123440-260-123440-0019)
WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RAYTHER NOT WE INDEED	(260-123440-260-123440-0020)
WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO THAT	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0000)
THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLI HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0001)
LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON GALLAATIONS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0002)
THE UNDERTAKING WHICH IS SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0003)
IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN D	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0004)
THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDENSED A	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0005)
A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ONGLINESS	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0006)
MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE FORGOTTEN MY GALLATIONS FOR INSTANCE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0007)
IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATATIONS AND ROGER PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0008)
IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THIS JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0009)
BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THEREIN	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0010)
THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE NO	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0011)
THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOR US	(2830-3979-2830-3979-0012)
IN EVERY OTHER WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0000)
THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF ALL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0001)
HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CRY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0002)
PAULA CAME LATER AND IS BENEATH US	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0003)
INDEED HE EXECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0004)
DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRELY CHURCH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0005)
AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY WITH MINISTRY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0006)
AS THE AMBASSADOR OF THIS GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0007)
PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN EASE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0008)
PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA OH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0009)
EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MAN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLS THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0010)
PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY ME NOR BY MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0011)
THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT TO OTHERS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0012)
HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BEFORE GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0013)
THE COOL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0014)
FOR A PERSON TO POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0015)
OH IT SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0016)
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL IS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0017)
I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRIES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0018)
I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD THIS SPIRITUAL BOASTING	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0019)
THIS IS MY SINFUL PRIDE IT IS HOLY PRIDE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0020)
THAT GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0021)
THE CLAUSE WAS SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0022)
THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS IN THEM BOTH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0023)
IN THIS WHOLE EPISTLE TOM TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0024)
BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND ALL EVIL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0025)
BUT FIRST TWO	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0026)
AND ALL THE BRETHREN THERE ARE WITH ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0027)
HE SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0028)
ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS DO	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0029)
THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS COME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0030)
WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE PEOPLE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0031)
WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH HE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0032)
NOT ALL THE GALATIONS HAD BECOME SUBVERTED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0033)
THESE MEANS MUST NOT BE CONTAMINATED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0034)
THEY REMAIN DIVINE AND REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0035)
BUT WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNS THERE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0036)
AND SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0037)
GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THY FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0038)
THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL CONSIDERED	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0039)
THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS REFRESHING YOU	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0040)
HIS GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0041)
THE WORLD BRANDS THIS A PERNICIOUS CUSTOM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0042)
NOW EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0043)
AND HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0044)
MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF MAN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0045)
WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO LEAVE FROM GOD THE FATHER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0046)
TO DO SO IS TO LEAVE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0047)
HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH AND LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0048)
EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE CASE OF GOD	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0049)
DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAID I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0050)
IF YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0051)
WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0052)
AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY HIGH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0053)
THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THE PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0054)
TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0055)
OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD HIS FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0056)
THE OURIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0057)
MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY FOR CHRIST	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0058)
PAUL STICKS TO HIS AME	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0059)
THAT HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLE	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0060)
NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASHAS LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0061)
NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM O OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0062)
UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE COUNSELS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0063)
HOW MAY WE GAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0064)
PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS IS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0065)
SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0066)
THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREATER SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0067)
THE GREATNESS OF MY RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0068)
THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR ALL SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0069)
BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE A LIGHT OF SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0070)
WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DIMINISH SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0071)
THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD BY SIN	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0072)
THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GREAT CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0073)
THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PECULIARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0074)
BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST TO THEM	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0075)
ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE WOULD DESPAIR	(2830-3980-2830-3980-0076)
HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MEN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES PLACED IN A FLUX OF SENSE	(2961-960-2961-960-0000)
THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO HER MISUNDERSTANDING	(2961-960-2961-960-0001)
IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEOPATINISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CONNECTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO	(2961-960-2961-960-0002)
THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM HIS EFFORTS TO REALIZE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL	(2961-960-2961-960-0003)
THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEO PLATINISTS	(2961-960-2961-960-0004)
IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED OF HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT	(2961-960-2961-960-0005)
THE FANCIES OF THE NEOPLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILS WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY	(2961-960-2961-960-0006)
BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO YOU	(2961-960-2961-960-0007)
WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE IS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND	(2961-960-2961-960-0008)
THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES BUT WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS	(2961-960-2961-960-0009)
BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE MATTER BEFORE THE SOUL	(2961-960-2961-960-0010)
WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE AN EXAGGORAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER	(2961-960-2961-960-0011)
MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE FREESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS	(2961-960-2961-960-0012)
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTIALLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE	(2961-960-2961-960-0013)
THE IDEAS ALWAYS REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES	(2961-960-2961-960-0014)
THE STYLE AND THE PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES	(2961-960-2961-960-0015)
BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PHEDRES OR SYMPOSIUMS	(2961-960-2961-960-0016)
BUT NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER	(2961-960-2961-960-0017)
BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN	(2961-960-2961-960-0018)
HE COULD WRITE IT IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA	(2961-960-2961-960-0019)
AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF A LUCRETIUS	(2961-960-2961-960-0020)
THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND NO MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIER WRITINGS	(2961-960-2961-960-0021)
PLATON HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART	(2961-960-2961-960-0022)
SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC'	(2961-961-2961-961-0000)
AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE	(2961-961-2961-961-0001)
AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS CITIZEN OF LOCRISIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIAS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE	(2961-961-2961-961-0002)
I WILL IF TIMAEUS APPROVES I BELIEVE	(2961-961-2961-961-0003)
LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SELLENS WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF TROPIDUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIUS AND HE TOLD ME	(2961-961-2961-961-0004)
SOME POEMS OF SALAN WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS	(2961-961-2961-961-0005)
AND WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEM SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK	(2961-961-2961-961-0006)
THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION INTO WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED	(2961-961-2961-961-0007)
BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND OF THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS	(2961-961-2961-961-0008)
TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE PAULEN HEARD THE STORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0009)
BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND THE OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES	(2961-961-2961-961-0010)
THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNALS TELLEN ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0011)
FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THAT FACE OF HEAVEN	(2961-961-2961-961-0012)
SELDOM MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS	(2961-961-2961-961-0013)
NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS IN EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED OURS AS OUR ANNALS RECORD	(2961-961-2961-961-0014)
THESE LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME	(2961-961-2961-961-0015)
I'LL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS	(2961-961-2961-961-0016)
OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CAREER THE LAW TOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN	(2961-961-2961-961-0017)
OF THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS	(2961-961-2961-961-0018)
FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE OR WHEN THE OTHER HELLENES HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS	(2961-961-2961-961-0019)
THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PARTS OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN	(2961-961-2961-961-0020)
BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH THY MEMORY	(2961-961-2961-961-0021)
THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORD SPEAK	(2961-961-2961-961-0022)
BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF A LADY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0000)
THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AND AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0001)
SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUAL LABOR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0002)
WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS TABOO MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THAT DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABOO OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0003)
IN THIS NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEISURE CLASS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0004)
INTO THE TABOO CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0005)
DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND MOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0006)
IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERY DAYS SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0007)
THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN ITS TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0008)
WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITIONS HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0009)
THAT OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0010)
THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND TRADITION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0011)
THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF REMARK IN GRATES	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0012)
THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY AND	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0013)
MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICIOUS CONSUMERS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0014)
SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERES WITHOUT QUALIFICATION	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0015)
MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PRESENCE A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMERS IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0016)
THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF A SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0017)
THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE BRIEFLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0018)
FOR THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0019)
SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDARY EMPLOYMENTS	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0020)
WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENT OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONOURIFIC CHARACTER	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0021)
THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR THEM	(3570-5694-3570-5694-0022)
IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE AND	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0000)
THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THIS INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0001)
BUT AS WE DESCEND THIS SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0002)
IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURED THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0003)
IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES THROUGH THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF A WASTED EFFORT	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0004)
THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEKEEPER'S PECUNIARY DECENCY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0005)
VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY ARE PUT AWAY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0006)
THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION TO THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0007)
THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTFULLY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0008)
EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE LATER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0009)
THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO AS ANOTHER LINE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0010)
IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF A CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0011)
IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT IN THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0012)
CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN HIS STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0013)
AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF GOVERNMENT GOSSIPS SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0014)
THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS LARGER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN	(3570-5695-3570-5695-0015)
UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY OPENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0000)
BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE THE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE CORSA PEACEABLE CULTURE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0001)
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOUR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS IN HUMAN USE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0002)
A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS EFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MANY AND INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMELIORATION EMBODIED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STYLE AND TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TORKES MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0003)
THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT ON DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0004)
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE REVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS AN OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUMER'S GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0005)
AND USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0006)
THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONVICTION WASTE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0007)
BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERY DAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERISED AS WASTE	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0008)
IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS CHANGE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0009)
AN ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF EASE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS	(3570-5696-3570-5696-0010)

YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CUSHION THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER	(3575-170457-3575-170457-0012)
THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PRIVATE DUTIES THE LESS LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION	(3575-170457-3575-170457-0013)
TO THOSE WHOSE DUTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR CELEBRITY	(3575-170457-3575-170457-0014)

HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANY MORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS	(672-122797-672-122797-0023)
THE PICTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE	(672-122797-672-122797-0024)

FOR THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM	(672-122797-672-122797-0042)
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE STORY	(672-122797-672-122797-0043)
AND IT LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIE	(672-122797-672-122797-0044)

I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE JEW	(672-122797-672-122797-0054)
AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS DEATH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LISTENED AND SAID	(672-122797-672-122797-0055)
SAID THE FIR TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF REPLIED	(672-122797-672-122797-0056)

DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BACON AND TALLOW CANDLES CAN'T YOU TELL ANY THE LARDER STORIES	(672-122797-672-122797-0061)
NO SAID THE TEA	(672-122797-672-122797-0062)
THEN GOOD BYE SAID THE KNIGHTS AND THEY WENT HOME	(672-122797-672-122797-0063)

NOW HE TOO IS OVER	(672-122797-672-122797-0065)
WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AS SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT	(672-122797-672-122797-0066)
THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED A TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE	(672-122797-672-122797-0067)
BUT IT WAS NOT THE FIR TREE THAT THEY MEANT IT	(672-122797-672-122797-0068)
IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG THOSE WEEDS AND NETTLES	(672-122797-672-122797-0069)
THE GOLDEN STAR OR TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE	(672-122797-672-122797-0070)
IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MERRIAD CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND A FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM	(672-122797-672-122797-0071)
OR THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE	(672-122797-672-122797-0072)
THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY OVER THE LARGE BREWING COPPER AND IT SIGHED SO DEEPLY	(672-122797-672-122797-0073)
HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE A STORY AT AN END	(672-122797-672-122797-0074)
KENNETH AND BETH REFRAINED FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGERS'S VISIT BUT THEY TOOK MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORGING A CHECK	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0000)

I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SIGHED THE OLD LAWYER	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0002)
IT WAS A LIBERAL THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0003)
BUT THEY COULD NOT BE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0004)
HE WAS TOO SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0005)
IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGED CHEQUE THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED THIS FREEDOM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0006)
BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE DONE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0007)

I WAS THE KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHEQUE AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0030)
AS REGARDS YOUR ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0031)
I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANTS BUT MARSHALL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0032)
IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UNFEELING NOT TO KNOW THE TRUTH	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0033)
I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANKING YOU SIR	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0034)

THEY FOUND HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0036)
I'VE HEARD LOTS OF THAT KIND IN MY DAY	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0037)
AND IT RUIN A MAN'S DISPOSITION	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0038)
HE LOOKS UP RATHER UNGRACIOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0039)

NOW HE DESERVES A TERM IN STATE'S PRISON	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0043)
HE HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS AN ANNOYANCE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0044)
I' LL PAY ALL THE COSTS BESIDES	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0045)
YOU'RE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU ALL THIS	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0046)
I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHOLL	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0047)
GIVE ME A CHEQUE FOR AN HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGED CHEQUE AND QUASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0048)
HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO TAKE ADVANTAGES OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATES	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0049)
BETH UNEASY AT HIS SILENCE NUNGED HIM	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0050)
THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SHORT FACE	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0051)
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD A FORGED CHEQUE FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0052)
AND I THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS	(6829-68769-6829-68769-0053)
SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD OPPOSE FORD'S AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0000)

THE YOUNG NEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM OPPOSITION	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0002)
THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIRED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0003)
UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS REYNOLDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE HAD PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPKINS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0004)
THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH REYNOLDS AND TO THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0005)
BUT THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE BUGGY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0006)
THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTIONS TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0007)

TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN WITH A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIAL REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0011)
THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN FOR THE NEIGHBOURS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESTS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0012)
THE ATTENDANCE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FORESEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR WALK	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0013)
WE'D OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTENDANCE BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0014)
WON'T YOU RUN THROUGH THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0015)
SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN BUT AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER ESPECIAL FAVORITE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0016)
THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BETH FOLLOWED THEM	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0017)
FOR A MOMENT BETH SAT STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND A SLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0018)
SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST A CLEAN BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0019)

FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF OUR VISITOR	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0024)
SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROCKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY CRIED BETH	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0025)

SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED AND	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0028)
BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELIZA SURPASSED HER IN ACTUAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0029)
HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANT	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0030)
HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAID'S MOUTH	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0031)
HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORM MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE MEN TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0032)
SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH THEIR BREATH	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0033)
I WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE ANSWERED FIERCELY	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0034)
WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE TO YOU	(6829-68771-6829-68771-0035)

CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS EVERYWHERE DURING MY JOURNEY	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0002)
FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN BUT FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UNHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCE	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0003)
SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE TO A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPENED FOR THEM	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0004)
THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEAVING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0005)

IT IS YOU WHO ARE MISTAKEN RAOUL I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND THE WHOLE DAY	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0009)
I CAN PERCEIVE LOVE TRULY ENOUGH	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0010)
I AM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE PRINCE	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0011)
AND IT IS ANNOYANCE THEN	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0012)
IN THOSE VERY TERMS I EVEN ADDED SO	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0013)
BUT CONTINUED RAOUL NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AND INDISCREET JEALOUS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0014)

BUT IN THIS DREADFUL PRESSURE RAW COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0017)
THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLIT AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENINGS HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYWHERE	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0018)
UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGS	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0019)
BRAGELONNE WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS AND LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVIL SLUMBERS OF MANI KEMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT	(6930-75918-6930-75918-0020)
I GOLIATH MAKES ANOTHER DISCOVERY	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0000)
THEY WERE CERTAINLY NOW NEARER THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0001)
THE POOR LITTLE THINGS CALLED CYNTHIA THINK OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0002)
NOW WHAT IS THE SENSE OF THEM TWO INNOCENT BABIES LIKE THAT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0003)
BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT DOWN HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE FACED HER COMPANION	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0004)
THE TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HER PICTURE TO THE WALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0005)
HERS HAPPENED TO BE ON THE SAME FRAME TO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0006)
WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHIA SPRAGG	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0007)
I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMPED THEN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE BUT IT'S BEEN OF SOME USE AFTER ALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0008)
DO YOU SUPPOSE THE MINIATURE WAS A COPY OF THE SAME LETTER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0009)
OR WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT QUERIED JOYCE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0010)
THEY'D WORRY ME TERRIBLY AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEMED SIN	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0011)
WE'LL COME INTO HERE THIS AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOTHES ON AND HAVE A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0012)
HE CAN'T HURT ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0013)
THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PEA	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0014)
SMUGGLING HER HOUSE CLEANING PARAPHERNALIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUST PAN TO THE OUTFIT	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0015)
THE LURE PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A YOUNG KITTEN MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0016)
OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE URGED I SHOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSE	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0017)
HE MAKES IS SORT OF COSIER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0018)
NOW LET'S DUST THE FURNITURE AND THE PICTURES	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0019)
THAT LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0020)
SURFACE DUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE BEST OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0021)
THEN SHE SUDDENLY CRIED	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0022)
AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS A USUAL	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0023)
THEY SAY ILLUMINATION FOR CANDLE LIGHT IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0024)
WHY IT'S GOLIATH AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING DOWN	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0025)
ISN'T HE THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO OUT CORNERS	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0026)
FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND SCURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN AN ODD CORNER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0027)
WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE BUT PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER	(6930-76324-6930-76324-0028)
NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY OR NOT IN REALITY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0000)
I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW KAPIR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0001)
ONWARD CAME A DISTANT VOICE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0002)
FOR NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0003)
THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME BUT IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0004)
WHAT WAS THAT THEN	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0005)
WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THIS POND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0006)
NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST INTO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0007)
IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HEART OF DEATH	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0008)
I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS A KAFFIR	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0009)
BUT A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0010)
A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AFRAID WHERE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0011)
SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNISED AS VOLTAIRE'S KAPIR	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0012)
I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED OUT MY HAND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0013)
IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY OWN HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLOURED	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0014)
I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAZED BEWILDEREDLY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0015)
FOR THAT IS KAFFIR'S KNIFE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0016)
I KNOW HE HAD IN THIS VERY EVENING	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0017)
I REMEMBERED SAYING HAVE WE BEEN HERE	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0018)
VOLTAIRE PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND THEN LOOKED AT IT	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0019)
I SAY YOU DON KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0020)
A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND AND	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0021)
I HAD ALREADY BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0022)
PERCHANCE TOO THAT KAFFIR'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0023)
MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEFT ME ME	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0024)
MY POSITION WAS TOO PAINFUL	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0025)
MY OVERWROUGHTER NERVES YIELDED AT LAST	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0026)
FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCT DISTINCTLY	(6930-81414-6930-81414-0027)
THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT ARE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0000)
TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS WHICH IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0001)
BY REASON AND IN AFFECTION	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0002)
AS THE CHAISE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE MASTER DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT AND VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING SOMETIMES AN IRREPARABLE INJURY	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0003)
THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHAISE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE COMES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0004)
SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0005)
THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE HOUSE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0006)
IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSES UNTIL WE ARE GONE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0007)
BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON HIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0008)
IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CANNOT BE OVERATED	(7021-79730-7021-79730-0009)
TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY WONDERFUL	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0000)
DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANES	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0001)
NOW DELIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY THE MEANS OF THESE DOLLS	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0002)
TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0003)
YOU HAVE COME ANDELLA AND DELLA WAS THE NAME OF JEAN'S DOLL TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0004)
I AM VERY GLAD THAT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0005)
I I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL ANDELLA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0006)
BUT TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0007)
FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS OF OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0008)
THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLL IN THE PARLOUR	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0009)
DELIA CAME TO THE PARLOUR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE A ANDELLA AND ROSALIE HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0010)
SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THEN	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0011)
SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHINGS SHE	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0012)
PUT THESE PLAYTHINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LIVING THEM OUT	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0013)
AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME FROM ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN	(7021-79740-7021-79740-0014)
NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS AND	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0000)
SO THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0001)
THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THESE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0002)
AND VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0003)
WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONNECTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0004)
THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VENGEANCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN	(7021-79759-7021-79759-0005)
BUT ANDERS CARED NOTHING BUT THAT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0000)
HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDRS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0001)
HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKNIFE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0002)
NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS WELL AS ONE HAS A JACKKNIFE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0003)
YES I NOT THOUGHT ANDERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0004)
SEEING THAT I AM SO DIFFERENT I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0005)
I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ARTHURS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0006)
AND SHE TOOK ANDER'S HAND AND WALKED WITH THEM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0007)
FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE HAIR	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0008)
AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND THE GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0009)
ON A HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0010)
THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET ANDER SIT IN HER GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0011)
BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HAND SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0012)
THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY IS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0013)
HE ONLY STRUCK HIS HEAD	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0014)
WELL BUT NOT SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN ROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0015)
THAT IS A VERY FINE PICTURE YOU HAVE HE SAID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0016)
SO IT IS SAID ANDROS	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0017)
AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM HIM	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0018)
AND WITH ONE JUMP ANDERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0019)
HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THEIR STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0020)
HE STILL HUNG ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0021)
AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENING WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0022)
BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A SPLENDID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0023)
ANDER'S FACE GREY RED	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0024)
BUT MY MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0025)
NO MY LITTLE COUSIN SHE SAID	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0026)
IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NEVER LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP	(7021-85628-7021-85628-0027)
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING PRISON WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0000)
AH VERY WELL THEN	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0001)
LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AU COURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION WE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0002)
GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT ANJON AND VILLEROI TOOK THEIR LEAVE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0003)
CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO BUT WHAT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0004)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LOUISINE	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0005)
HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHAT IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0006)
IT IS NOT NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWNED	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0007)

THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN THE QUADRILLE CASTING A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL	(7127-75946-7127-75946-0029)
EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE THE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BEDIMMED	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0000)

GOOD GRACIOUS HAS THE KING ANY RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN LETTERS OF THAT KIND	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0035)
I DID GIVE MY CONSENT	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0036)
OH I AM SPEAKING SERIOUSLY REPLIED MONTALAIS AND MY OPINION OF THIS CASE IS QUITE AS GOOD AS THE KING'S I SUPPOSE IS IT NOT LOUISE	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0037)
LET US RUN THEN SAID ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR SILK DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPENED SPACE BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE THICKEST COVERT OF THE PARK	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0038)

IN THIS WAY THE FETE OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FETE ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER IN THE BRAKE THE PHEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX IN ITS HOLE WERE ALL DANCING	(7127-75947-7127-75947-0040)
ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOR SCATTERED IN WIDE SPLASHES	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0000)
THE MERGANCER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF IRIDESCENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PENCILED AND BLACK AND WHITE AND A BREAST OF RICH CHESTNUT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0001)
HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW TOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS LIGHT RED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0002)
BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD SO RENDING CLAWS	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0003)
BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMORANT HE SHOT DOWN UPON THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0004)
ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PURCHASE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0005)
IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A PERFECTLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0006)
BUT SUCH WAS HIS EAGERNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS ENGORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0007)
IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWN WARD TOO SOON	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0008)
THE GREAT HULK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO RETRIEVE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUNDS	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0009)
THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE IN HER JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSH TO DEVOUR IT	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0010)
IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN ITS STRAINED GULLET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0011)
THE HAWK ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SATISFIED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0012)
LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THAT DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0013)
THE HAWK SAT UPON THE PORCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0014)
ALMOST CONSTANTLY HE WAS FORCED TO THE TOP	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0015)
STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK GLIDED FROM HIS PERCH AND DARTED BEFORE HIM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0016)
BUT AT THIS TURN IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0017)
BUT THIS FREQUENTER OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALORS WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0018)
AS HE FLEW HE DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0019)
WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSE TO BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0020)
BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD THEN HESITATED TO STRIKE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0021)
THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DESPISED	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0022)
HE HAD A LOT OF LIFE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CASTE BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0023)
THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT CAUGHT JUST ON THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0024)
AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMANS STANDING ON THE BANK	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0025)
THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND A LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0026)
AGAIN THE LEADER PARTED FROM THE LINE	(7176-88083-7176-88083-0027)
HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS TO HIS PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO A SYMPOSIUM ON THE PRICE OF GOLF BALLS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0000)
IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY TO SAY SO	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0001)
BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMATIST HAS HIS GROUNDS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0002)
YOUR PAY MUST BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0003)
FRANKLY I CANNOT ALWAYS SAY WHY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0004)
BUT SUPPOSE I SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0005)
I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FROM A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0006)
ANYHOW IT'S JOLLY EXCITING AND I CAN DO THE DIALOGUE AL ALL RIGHT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0007)
LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND THEN YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGE CRAFT IS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0008)
AND I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HOMILY ON SOLILOQUYS	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0009)
HIM SHOULD BE OR NOT TO BE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0010)
NOW THE OBJECT OF THIS SOLILOQUY IS PLEASANT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0011)
INDEED IRRESOLUTION BEING THE KEYNOTE OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WILL MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEANING	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0012)
WE MODERNS HOWEVER NEVER SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0013)
IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT THE SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STAGE TECHNIQUE HOW SHALL A SOLILOQUY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0014)
AND SO ON TILL YOU GOT TO THE END WHEN OPHELIA MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON COMMITTAL OF THAT SORT	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0015)
THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0016)
IN THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF HIS CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0017)
IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS THEM WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD NOTHING BE MORE NATURAL	(7176-92135-7176-92135-0018)

THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED WITH HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0000)
AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF MURCHESTON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN WAS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0001)
WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING IN UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0002)
THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSE'S COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLE TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE IN SCOTLAND	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0003)
FIVE THOUSAND MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCOE WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0004)
DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLEY AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAVE BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0005)
THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH SO CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0006)
BY QUICK MARCHES OVER THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0007)
WITH THESE AND SOME REINFORCEMENTS OF THE ATHOL MEN AND MACDONALD'S WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0008)
THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INTERLOCCHI SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0009)
BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNERLORE AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTED COVENANTERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0010)
HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MINDS IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED CONSPICUOUS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0011)
MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH MIGHTY FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0012)
FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS WERE APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD RELY ON	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0013)
BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROGRESS OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0014)
THAT THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0015)
VALOUR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PREPARATION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0016)
HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANYTHING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINE A SUCCESS	(8224-274381-8224-274381-0017)
HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW UNDER THE HILL	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0000)
THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY THE PRISONER	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0001)
THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT HE HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0002)
OR HATH HE GIVEN HER ANY GIFT	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0003)
AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TAKEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DO YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0004)
ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG NO	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0005)
THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR HIS PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0006)
HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR YOU	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0007)
THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO THEIR FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0008)
THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID OUR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0009)
BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE OBSERVED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0010)
THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MYSTERIOUS AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0011)
IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCOR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUSLY THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0012)
HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WERE A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE	(8224-274384-8224-274384-0013)
THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTYTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0000)
WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATED IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0001)
WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD SCARCELY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0002)
AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSITIVE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0003)
THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING AT FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0004)
ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TUNABILITY AS A HELP AND THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0005)
THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING HIS RECORD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0006)
IT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIORIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0007)
BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE IT IS WARRANTED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0008)
OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILYLY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0009)
WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0010)
SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS APPEAR VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0011)
FAMILIARITY IS A FEELING CAPABLE OF DEGREES I	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0012)
IN THIS IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0013)
I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST GIVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0014)
THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE CORNERS OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0015)
IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVEN	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0016)
THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF THE PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0017)
THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIMELY ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0018)
IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED MEANS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0019)
IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECTS OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0020)
REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING ALL RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0021)
SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THE THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0022)
IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER GRAVE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0023)
THE FIRST OF THESE VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0024)
WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIENCY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0025)
THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT THIS IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0026)
A GRAMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKE TO APPEAR	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0027)
I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THEM	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0028)
THE FACT THAT A MAN SHOULD RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0029)
SYMONDS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY TO	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0030)
THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH ARE WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0031)
IT IS HIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0032)
IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT ONE TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0033)
WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGEMENT WHICH IS FAMILIAR	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0034)
THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ONLY	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0035)
A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION AND	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0036)
RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTICS WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNISE IN THE CAT OF THE MOVEMENT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0037)
WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNISE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORDS	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0038)
THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH IN OTHER IT IS NOT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0039)
THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE BUT AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0040)
THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE BECOME THE MOST IMPORTANT	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0041)
THUS IF I RECOGNISE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNISE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS ON WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0042)
OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS A RECOGNITION	(8230-279154-8230-279154-0043)
I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAIRS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0000)

JACK WOULD BECOME EVA'S HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMIDST THE HURRIED OBEDIENCE OF THE EAGER WORLD	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0028)
THINKING OF ALL THIS I GOT TO SLEEP	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0029)
MISTER NEVERBEND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT AND CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0030)
YOU WOULD HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT COURTESY AND HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STANDS SO HIGH	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0031)
IT IS A CITY SAID I	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0032)

THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANY THING THAT I HAD YET FELT	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0041)
YOU HEAR WHAT SIR FERDINAND O' BROWNE HAS SAID REPLIED CAPTAIN BATTLEMAX	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0042)
BUT WHAT IS IT DELICATE MISSION I ASKED	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0043)

THEN THE REPUBLIC OF BRITANNULA WAS TO BE DECLARED AS NON EXISTENT AND THAT BRITISH FLAG WAS TO BE EXALTED AND A BRITISH GOVERNOR INSTALLED IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0045)
YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE IT'S THERE SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEACK AND THAT I CAN SO USE IT AS TO HALF OBLITERATE YOUR TOWN WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF MY RETURN ON BOARD	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0046)
THEN YOU PROPOSE TO KIDNAP ME I SAID	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0047)

THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COLONY ARE WITHIN HIS EXCELLENCY'S KNOWLEDGE	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0056)

AND THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED TOO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM THEM A PROMISE THAT I WOULD DEPART IN PEACE	(8455-210777-8455-210777-0070)
