1089-134686-0000 HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STEW FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUTTON PIECES TO BE LADLED OUT IN THICK PEPPERED FLOUR FATDENED SAUCE
1089-134686-0001 STUFFED IT INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNSELLED HIM
1089-134686-0002 AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID COURT OF THE BROTHELS
1089-134686-0003 HULLO BERTIE ANY GOOD IN YOUR MINDS
1089-134686-0004 NUMBER TEN FRESH NELLY IS WAITING ON YOU GOODNIGHT HUSBAND
1089-134686-0005 THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND SHE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLEY'S FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEARINESS
1089-134686-0006 THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHEREON ANOTHER EQUATION BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABROAD ITS WIDENING
1089-134686-0007 A COLD LUCID INDIFFERENCE REIGNED IN THE SOUL
1089-134686-0008 THE CHAOS IN WHICH HIS ARDOR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COMPLETE INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
1089-134686-0009 AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF EQUAL GRACE
1089-134686-0010 WELL NOW ENNIS I DECLARED YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
1089-134686-0011 ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE SODALITY MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECITE THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS A CUSHIONED KNEELING DESK TO THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSES
1089-134686-0012 HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLINESS HER STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
1089-134686-0013 IF EVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER AUNT
1089-134686-0014 THEY TRIED TO THINK HOW IT COULD BE
1089-134686-0015 BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOLROOM COVERED UP HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
1089-134686-0016 THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATECHISM DAALUS
1089-134686-0017 STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT IT WHICH HERON CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
1089-134686-0018 IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN COMMENDATION
1089-134686-0019 THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENDS AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAVE SEEMED TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLEN PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROPE IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
1089-134686-0020 IF A MAN HAD STOLEN A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUNDS TO AMASS A HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOLEN ONLY OR THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST ACCRUING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
1089-134686-0021 IF A LAYMAN IN GETTING BAPTISM POUR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
1089-134686-0022 HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BEATITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF FRANCE THE SECOND BEATITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
1089-134686-0023 WHY WAS THAT SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SOUL AND DIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
1089-134686-0024 IF THE WINES CHANGE INTO VINEGAR AND THE HOUSE CRUMBLE INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IS JESUS CHRIST STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
1089-134686-0025 THE GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
1089-134686-0026 THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR A CATECHISM TO HEAR THE LESSON THROUGH
1089-134686-0027 HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND ASKED
1089-134686-0028 THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN UPON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOR OF SAINT FRANCIS XAVIOUR WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY
1089-134686-0029 ON FRIDAY CONFESSION SHALL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS
1089-134686-0030 BEWARE OF MAKING THAT MISCHIEF
1089-134686-0031 STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FADE WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING FLOWERS
1089-134686-0032 HE IS KILLED AS YOU KNOW THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIES
1089-134686-0033 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS CAVIOUR
1089-134686-0034 THE RECTOR PAUSED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASPED HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT OUT
1089-134686-0035 I HAD THE FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS
1089-134686-0036 THE GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS XAVIOR
1089-134686-0037 IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK EYES KINDLED THE DUSK INTO A TAWNY GLOW
1089-134691-0000 HE COULD WAIT NO MORE
1089-134691-0001 FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WRITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0002 HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT A POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE
1089-134691-0003 THE UNEXPECTED
1089-134691-0004 PRIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE A LONG SLOW WAVES
1089-134691-0005 WHOSE FEET ARE AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THY EVERLASTING ARMS
1089-134691-0006 THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD PROPOSED
1089-134691-0007 SOON THE WHOLE BRANCH WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING
1089-134691-0008 THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE THE FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
1089-134691-0009 ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK HATS AND TUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKEY
1089-134691-0010 BROTHER MAC CARDELL BROTHER KIELF
1089-134691-0011 THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAVE EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION
1089-134691-0012 IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY COULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
1089-134691-0013 IDLE AND EMBITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
1089-134691-0014 THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SEASON HARMONIZED IN ACCORD
1089-134691-0015 WORDS WAS IT THEIR HEARTS
1089-134691-0016 THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NOMADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND SOUTHWARD BOUND
1089-134691-0017 THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEYD AND WOOD BEGIRT AND CITADELLED AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARSHALLED RACES
1089-134691-0018 AGAIN IT AGAIN
1089-134691-0019 A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE GIRL WAS CALLING
1089-134691-0020 HELLOA STEPHANOS HERE COMES THE DAEDALUS
1089-134691-0021 THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HEWN STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSE PLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WET LUSTRES
1089-134691-0022 HE STOOD STILL IN DEFERENCE TO THEIR RULES AND PARRIED THEIR BANTER WITH EASY WORDS
1089-134691-0023 IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THE PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
1089-134691-0024 STEPHANO STEADLO
1089-134691-0025 A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAZE THAT CITY
1188-133604-0000 YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOR MEN TITIAN HOLBEIN TURNER AND TINTORET IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
1188-133604-0001 THEY UNITE EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WOULD FIND ME REFERRING TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS CHIOSCURISTS
1188-133604-0002 BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CURUSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
1188-133604-0003 MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MAY ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUE SIDE BY SIDE
1188-133604-0004 SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PINS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGE
1188-133604-0005 IT IS THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPATCHIUS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
1188-133604-0006 THEN HE COMES TO THE BEATING OF IT
1188-133604-0007 THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK IS PUT TO THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GREY DEFINE THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE
1188-133604-0008 FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIFE WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH
1188-133604-0009 NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS ENCLOSED PROPERLY AN HARMONIZE WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEY ARE GRADATED JUSTLY
1188-133604-0010 BUT IN THIS VIGNETTE COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT CAREFULLY
1188-133604-0011 THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAT I KNOW EXISTING AND DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVOURITE CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER
1188-133604-0012 IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLOURIST WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOUR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THIS VIRTUE IS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS
1188-133604-0013 IT MUST REMAIN BE ONE OR THE OTHER
1188-133604-0014 DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL IS AN EVIL ONE
1188-133604-0015 THE LAW OF THE SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MISTS OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
1188-133604-0016 THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THAT CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELLER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
1188-133604-0017 THAT A STYLE IS RESTRAINING OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS
1188-133604-0018 IN ALL EARTHLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND PLEASURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
1188-133604-0019 THE STRANGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
1188-133604-0020 BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY THAT YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
1188-133604-0021 IT WILL BE EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
1188-133604-0022 YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF ME
1188-133604-0023 THE COLOURIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARROQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGING AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
1188-133604-0024 NOTHING WOULD BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
1188-133604-0025 YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM AND HAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0026 HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MISTS THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MISTS APOLLO AND THE PYTHON
1188-133604-0027 NOW HERE IS RAPHAEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF EQUALLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
1188-133604-0028 WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNER'S GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND OF THE STERNEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0029 THEN THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0030 I KNOWS THEM BOTH
1188-133604-0031 THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER THE DUDDY AND THE FLINT
1188-133604-0032 IT IS ONLY A PENCIL OUTLIN BY EDWARD BYRNE JONES AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE STORY OF PSYCHE IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
1188-133604-0033 EVERY PLANT ON THE GRASS IS SET FORMALLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
1188-133604-0034 EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND COMFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHAUCER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
1188-133604-0035 THUS IN CHAUCER'S VIEW
1188-133604-0036 IN BOTH THESE BIG MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOUGH SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
1188-133604-0037 EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF HOLBEIN OR DURATION
1188-133604-0038 BUT NOW THERE IS A SUBJECT ON WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL
1188-133604-0039 IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPIRITUALITY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
1188-133604-0040 THE CRAMPNESS AND THE POVERTY ARE ALL CONNECTED
1188-133604-0041 IT IS A GLEANER BRINGING DOWN HER OWN SHEAF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATER MILL ITSELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET ITS STONES TO TURN
1188-133604-0042 THE SCENERY IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
1188-133604-0043 SEE THAT YOUR LIVES BE WITH NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED KITE
1188-133604-0044 IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KITES FLY FALCONS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THEY LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WARWOLF AND THE GEAR EAGLE
121-121726-0000 ALSO A POPULAR CONTRIVANCE WHEREBY LOVE MAKING MAY BE SUSPENDED OR NOT STOPPED DURING THE PICNIC SEASON
121-121726-0001 HARANGUE THE TIRESOME PROGRESS OF A TIRELESS TONGUE
121-121726-0002 ANGER PAIN PAINFUL TO HEAR OF

121-121726-0006 I HEREDITY THE CAUSE OF ALL OUR FAULTS
121-121726-0007 HORSE SENSE A DEGREE OF WISDOM THAT KEEPS ONE FROM BETTING OF THE RACES
121-121726-0008 HOSE MAN'S EXCUSE FOR WETTING THAT WALK
121-121726-0009 HOTEL A PLACE WHERE A GUEST OFTEN GIVES UP GOOD DOLLARS FOR POORER QUARTERS
121-121726-0010 HOUSE CLEANING A DOMESTIC UPHEAVAL THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ENLIST ALL OF THE SOLDIERS IT NEEDS
121-121726-0011 HUSBAND THE NEXT THING TO A HUSBAND
121-121726-0012 HUSSY WOMAN IN BOND TIE
121-121726-0013 AND TIED TO A WOMAN
121-121726-0014 A HYPOCRITE A HORSE DEALER
121-123852-0000 THOSE PRETTY WRONGS THAT LIBERTY COMMITS WHEN I AM SOME TIME ABSENT FROM THY HEART THY BEAUTY AND THY YEARS FALL WELL BEFITS FOR STILL TEMPTATION FOLLOWS WHERE THOU ART
121-123852-0001 I IS
121-123852-0002 NO MATTER THEN ALTHOUGH MY FOOT DID STAND UPON THE FARTHEST EARTH REMOVED FROM THEE FOR NIMBLE THOUGHT CAN JUMP BOTH SEA AND LAND AS SOON AS THINK THE PLACE WHERE HE WILL BE BUT AH
121-123852-0003 THOUGHT KILLS ME THAT I AM NOT THOUGHT TO LEAP LARGE LENGTHS OF MILES WHEN THOU ART GONE BUT THAT SO MUCH OF EARTH AND WATER WROUGHT I MUST ATTEND TIME'S LEISURE WITH MY MOAN RECEIVING NOT BY THE ELEMENTS SO SLOW BUT HEAVY TEARS BADGES OF EITHER'S WOE
121-123852-0004 MY HEART DOTH PLEAD THAT THOU IN HIM DOST LIE A CLOSET NEVER PIERCED WITH CRYSTALL EYES BUT A DEFENDANT DOTH THAT PLEA DENY AND SAYS IN HIM THY FAIR APPEARANCE LIES
121-123859-0000 YOU ARE MY ALL THE WORLD AND I MUST STRIVE TO KNOW MY SHAMES AND PRAISES FROM YOUR TONGUE NONE ELSE TO ME NOR I TO NONE ALIVE DID MY STEELED SENSE O'ER CHANGES RIGHT OR WRONG

121-123859-0004 SO I RETURN REBUKED TO MY CONVENT AND GAIN BY ILL THRICE MORE THAN I HAVE SPENT
121-127105-0000 IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT DREW FROM DOUGLAS NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING A REPLY THAT HAD THIS INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
121-127105-0001 SOME ONE ELSE TOLD A STORY NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE BUT I SAW HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING
121-127105-0002 CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF IT HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF INSTEAD OF ME HE SAW WHAT HE SPOKE OF
121-127105-0003 THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROAN AT THIS AND MUCH REPROACH AFTER WHICH IN HIS PREOCCUPIED WAY HE RESUMED
121-127105-0004 YOUR STORY'S WRITTEN
121-127105-0005 I WILL WRITE TO MY MAN AND ENCLOSE THE KEY HE COULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FINDS IT
121-127105-0006 THE OTHERS RESENTED POSTPONEMENTS BUT IT WAS JUST HIS SCRUPLES THAT CHARMED ME
121-127105-0007 TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT AH THANK GOD NO AND IS THE RECORD YOURS
121-127105-0008 HE HUNG FIRE AGAIN A WOMAN
121-127105-0009 SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THESE FIFTY YEARS
121-127105-0010 SHE SENT ME HER PAGES IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED
121-127105-0011 SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF WHATEVER
121-127105-0012 IT WAS N'T SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE
121-127105-0013 YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR IF THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME
121-127105-0014 YOU ARE QUITE
121-127105-0015 HE QUITTED THE SIDE AND DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
121-127105-0016 PROBABLY NOT TILL A SECOND POST
121-127105-0017 IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL DIE
121-127105-0018 ASKED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED
121-127105-0019 MISSUS GRIFFIN HOWEVER PRESSED THE NEED FOR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT
121-127105-0020 WHO WAS IT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE STORY WILL TELL I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO REPLY NO I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE STORY THE STORY WON'T TELL SAID DOUGLAS NOT IN ANY LITERAL VULGAR WAY MORE'S THE PITY THEN
121-127105-0021 WON'T YOU HELP DOUGLAS
121-127105-0022 BUT IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHO HE WAS
121-127105-0023 LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHOULD PRESENTLY GIVE
121-127105-0024 POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT OF IMMENSE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH
121-127105-0025 THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED US OUT
121-127105-0026 THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYING THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN
121-127105-0027 HE HAD OF HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED
121-127105-0028 THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT THEIR OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME
121-127105-0029 THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WILL BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY
121-127105-0030 I CAN'T ANTICIPATE
121-127105-0031 SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES WITH LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS
121-127105-0032 YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTIFUL OF HER PASSION
121-127105-0033 IT WAS THE DUTY OF IT
121-127105-0034 IT SOUNDED DULL BUT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS PAINFUL CONDITION WHICH WAS
121-127105-0035 SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED THAT HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED
121-127105-0036 BUT WAS THAT ALL OUR REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED
1221-135766-0000 HOW STRANGE IT SEEMS TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
1221-135766-0001 GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS IN THAT SAME DISHONOURED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN
1221-135766-0002 YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HECTOR PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
1221-135766-0003 THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY THE ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
1221-135766-0004 THAT OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
1221-135766-0005 HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL TO EARTH
1221-135766-0006 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY THE EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
1221-135766-0007 HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF VERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
1221-135766-0008 MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE ALREADY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135766-0009 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN THEIR REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT
1221-135766-0010 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WIDE FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
1221-135766-0011 BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE OF EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE
1221-135766-0012 BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE LAST WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
1221-135766-0013 PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST TO THE INFANTILE WORLD
1221-135766-0014 PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCES
1221-135766-0015 IF SPOKEN TO SHE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN
1221-135767-0000 HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THAT FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY
1221-135767-0001 ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAT THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
1221-135767-0002 AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILDREN WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE
1221-135767-0003 THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF IN THE LEGISLATURE
1221-135767-0004 WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH IN DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
1221-135767-0005 HE WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
1221-135767-0006 THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WAS SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE
1221-135767-0007 BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HE EVER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
1221-135767-0008 COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD TO THEM
1221-135767-0009 BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER BROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
1221-135767-0010 WE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
1221-135767-0011 IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIME
1221-135767-0012 THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH IS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICED WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
1221-135767-0013 LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE PRISONER'S BOND SERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
1221-135767-0014 YEA HIS HONOURABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN THAT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEECH
1221-135767-0015 YE MAY NOT SEE ITS WORSHIP NOW
1221-135767-0016 WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIREST STATION IN HIS NATIVE LAND
1221-135767-0017 ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MAY HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE
1221-135767-0018 LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTIS PIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREASTPLATE
1221-135767-0019 FATHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOK
1221-135767-0020 IN TRUTH SHE FELT ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
1221-135767-0021 PEARLE ACCORDINGLY WENT TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY
1221-135767-0022 BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE HIS NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
1221-135767-0023 THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS ON THE BACK OF A BULL
1221-135767-0024 PEARLER SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
1284-1180-0000 HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEE PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A WHITE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD
1284-1180-0001 HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN WITH A FLAT BRIM AND ROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
1284-1180-0002 INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD BROAD CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID
1284-1180-0003 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ ON WHICH THEY LIVED
1284-1180-0004 WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNC SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED DOWN THE PATH
1284-1180-0005 NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANYONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHEN THEY WERE GONE
1284-1180-0006 AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE MELICANS THE PATH DIVIDED
1284-1180-0007 HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSES OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR
1284-1180-0008 ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE LITTLE MUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
1284-1180-0009 THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPARD
1284-1180-0010 UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED MAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
1284-1180-0011 I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO OUR HOME
1284-1180-0012 WE ARE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE
1284-1180-0013 AND YOU SHALL BE OJO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED
1284-1180-0014 BOJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE
1284-1180-0015 WE WERE TRAVELLING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
1284-1180-0016 THE OLD WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
1284-1180-0017 AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A HUGE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
1284-1180-0018 IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGICAL POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
1284-1180-0019 YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE INTO OLD MOMBI THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
1284-1180-0020 THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS BEEN EVER SINCE
1284-1180-0021 I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKE WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
1284-1180-0022 I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT A LAND OF OZ
1284-1180-0023 YOU SEE I' HAVE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC NUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
1284-1180-0024 THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN HER SYMPATHETIC TONE
1284-1180-0025 I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAYS MARGOLOTTE LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
1284-1180-0026 BUT FIRST I SHALL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
1284-1180-0027 AND YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
1284-1180-0028 A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTH AND NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER
1284-1180-0029 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED
1284-1180-0030 WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR THE SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLOURS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE
1284-1180-0031 AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OZMA LIVED GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOUR
1284-1180-0032 I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND HE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
1284-1181-0000 OJO EXAMINED THIS HIDEOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
1284-1181-0001 MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM UPON THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL THROUGHOUT
1284-1181-0002 THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRLS WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
1284-1181-0003 HIS HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
1284-1181-0004 GOLD IS THE MOST UNCOMMON MEDAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
1284-1181-0005 NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE CHAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
1284-1181-0006 WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MAGOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
1284-1181-0007 SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FOR EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
1284-1181-0008 I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERMON
1284-1181-0009 SHE RAN TO HER COUSIN'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR KETTLES FROM THE FIRE
1284-1181-0010 OUR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
1284-1181-0011 VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALL TOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN STONE
1284-1181-0012 NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE PATCH OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
1284-1181-0013 OJO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THIS DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
1284-1181-0014 HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON SOME OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
1284-1181-0015 MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A GRIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
1284-1181-0016 I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD THE VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
1284-1181-0017 THE WIZARD OF OZ WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS NEARLY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERESS
1284-1181-0018 THIS TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN
1284-1181-0019 I KNOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN
1284-1181-0020 DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTERBOX YOU'RE GOING TO BE UNC REMARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
1284-1181-0021 ASKED THE BOYS IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
1284-134647-0000 THE GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAD CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
1284-134647-0001 THE EDICT OF MILAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PRESERVING HIS OWN RELIGION
1284-134647-0002 BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR IMBIBED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTS WHICH DISSENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE OPPRESSED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
1284-134647-0003 CONSTANTINE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERETICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS PLANS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION
1284-134647-0004 SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EDICTS OF DIOCLETIAN AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSIONS WAS APPLAUDED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
1284-134647-0005 THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXULTATION THAT THE APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTAGION OF GUILT AND SCHISM AND THAT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO A CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED INVIOLATE THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISCIPLINE
1284-134647-0006 BISHOPS VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DONNA
1284-134647-0007 PROSCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DONNATISTS STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN NUMIDIA THE SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGED THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
1320-122612-0000 SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TALE THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER NOR THE SAVAGE IS EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATE ITS WILD RECESSES
1320-122612-0001 THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXHALE AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHEDDING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT ON THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
1320-122612-0002 AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAKKIE WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
1320-122612-0003 HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULET WITHOUT ACTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
1320-122612-0004 DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGACHGOOK WERE FREQUENT AND IN EARNEST
1320-122612-0005 YET HERE ARE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCARONES AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
1320-122612-0006 LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE THEM AS WE GO WITH KEENER EYES
1320-122612-0007 CHINGACHGOOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE MADE HIM SPEAK
1320-122612-0008 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIRS OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
1320-122612-0009 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A PITY
1320-122612-0010 SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THIS DARK HARE HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
1320-122612-0011 IF A ROCK OR A RIVULET OR A BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE CLUE THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED HIM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
1320-122612-0012 EXTINGUISHED BRANDS WERE LYING ON A SPRING THE OFFALS OF A DEER WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWSED BY THE HORSES
1320-122612-0013 A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGMENT TO HIS PORTION
1320-122612-0014 THE EXAMINATIONS HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
1320-122612-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOIST ALLUVAN
1320-122612-0016 TURN BACK UNCAS AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SINGER'S FOOT
1320-122617-0000 NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HAWKEYE HE FULLY COMPREHENDED BOTH THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR
1320-122617-0001 IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACUTE AND PRACTICED INTELLECTS WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT THE WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
1320-122617-0002 IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BALIM'S ASS TO SPEAK HE WAS SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL ON THE SUBJECT OF A BEAR'S SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
1320-122617-0003 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER AIR AND MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
1320-122617-0004 THAT INGENIOUS HAWKEYE WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
1320-122617-0005 THE BEAR STRUCK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
1320-122617-0006 SHALL THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HIM
1320-122617-0007 COME COME RETURNED HAWKEYE ENCASING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE AS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT WHICH THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN AND THE SUN HAVE NOT BESTOWED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS
1320-122617-0008 THE YOUNG MAN IS IN BONDAGE AND YET I FEAR HIS DEATH IS DECREED
1320-122617-0009 I GREATLY MOURN THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HYMN CAN YOU LEAD ME TO IT
1320-122617-0010 THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURNED DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FEAR YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASED THAN MITIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
1320-122617-0011 THE LODGE IN WHICH UNCAS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTER OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OPPOSITION
1320-122617-0012 FOUR OR FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON TO UNCAS WARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
1320-122617-0013 DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF ASSENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE COULD RECEIVE IN WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS IN AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
1320-122617-0014 THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTIONED TO THIS SUPPOSED CONJUROR TO ENTER
1320-122617-0015 BUT THE BEAR INSTEAD OF OBEYING MAINTAINED A SEAT IT HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
1320-122617-0016 THAT CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TOO CONTINUED DAVID IMPROVING THE HINT HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
1320-122617-0017 THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY TURNED THE PLACE
1320-122617-0018 IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE AND LIGHTED WITH THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COOKERY
1320-122617-0019 UNCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL ANDES
1320-122617-0020 THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THIS PRIVACY
1320-122617-0021 WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MINGOS AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THIS SINGER IS AS GOOD AS NOTHING
1320-122617-0022 THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUTSTRIP THE BEER
1320-122617-0023 UNCAS WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR IN READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LODGE
1320-122617-0024 BUT HAWKEYE WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF AND TO HIS COMPANION
1320-122617-0025 SO UNCAS YOU HAD BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN AND TRUST TO CUTTING FOR WANT OF SPEED
1320-122617-0026 BUT WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE IN WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION
1320-122617-0027 AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THAT SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
1320-122617-0028 MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS WHOLLY GIVEN TO MERCY AND LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NETTLED AT SO DIRECT AN ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREATEST STRAITS
1320-122617-0029 IF YOU ARE NOT WELL KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING A NON COMPOSOR WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED
1320-122617-0030 SO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF NOT MAKE A RUSH OR TARRY HERE
1320-122617-0031 BRAVELY AND GENEROUSLY HAS HE BATTLED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS AND MORE WILL I DESERVE IN HIS SERVICE
1320-122617-0032 KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE AUDIENCE THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
1320-122617-0033 IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND UPON IT UNCAS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT AS BECOMES SURE WARRIORS AND TRUSTY FRIENDS
1320-122617-0034 HOLD SAID DAVID PERCEIVING THAT WITH THIS ASSURANCE THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM I AM THE UNWORTHY AND HUMBLE FOLLOWER OF ONE WHO TAUGHT NOT THE DAMNABLE PRINCIPLE OF REVENGE
1320-122617-0035 THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN PINING FOR A CONDITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTISE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT THE CROSS OF BLOOD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN
1320-122617-0036 GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SCENT IS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THAT MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING ETERNITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS AND THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
1320-122617-0037 THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHTS TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
1320-122617-0038 WOULD THE HURONS HEAR HIS GROANS
1320-122617-0039 THE MOHICAN STARTED IN HIS FEET AND SHOOK HIS SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFEITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
1320-122617-0040 HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE VILLAGE
1320-122617-0041 UNCAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HER OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS
1580-141083-0000 I WILL ENDEAVOR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLEW AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
1580-141083-0001 I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION I WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
1580-141083-0002 MY WIFE'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
1580-141083-0003 WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN REMARKABLE MAN
1580-141083-0004 I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
1580-141083-0005 I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN ONE HOUR
1580-141083-0006 THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED AS FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
1580-141083-0007 THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0008 THE PROOF IS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
1580-141083-0009 THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE STAIRS
1580-141083-0010 I GAVE HIM THE LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
1580-141083-0011 A BROKEN TIP OF WOOD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
1580-141083-0012 NOT ONLY THIS BUT UPON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOUGH OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKED LIKE SAWDUST IN IT
1580-141083-0013 ABOVE ALL THINGS YOU DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
1580-141083-0014 TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE HOLDING UP
1580-141083-0015 DID ANY ONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THAT PRINTER
1580-141083-0016 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT THEIR DOOR OPEN
1580-141083-0017 SO THIS SEEMS TO ME
1580-141083-0018 NOW MISTER HOLMES AT YOUR DISPOSAL
1580-141083-0019 ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE FOR EACH STORY
1580-141083-0020 THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
1580-141083-0021 THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PANE SAID THE LEARNED GUIDE
1580-141083-0022 I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNALS HERE SAID HE
1580-141083-0023 ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO RARE A DAY
1580-141083-0024 YOU LEFT HIM ON A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
1580-141083-0025 THE KING ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
1580-141083-0026 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE CAN NOT SAID SOLMES FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
1580-141083-0027 HOW LONG DID IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
1580-141083-0028 THEN HE TOSSED THEM DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT
1580-141083-0029 HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN MY RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
1580-141083-0030 MISTER SOLMES WAS SUDDENLY OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
1580-141083-0031 HOLMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS R N AND A SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
1580-141083-0032 WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHER
1580-141083-0033 I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SAW NOTHING
1580-141083-0034 AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR THE EMERGENCY
1580-141083-0035 HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HELLO WHAT'S THIS
1580-141083-0036 HOLMES HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS
1580-141083-0037 WHAT COULD HE DO HE CALLED UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
1580-141083-0038 I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR THERE ARE
1580-141083-0039 AND THEY ARE ALL IN FROM THIS EXAMINATION YES
1580-141083-0040 ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PRINCIPLES
1580-141083-0041 LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOF
1580-141083-0042 MY MASTER HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
1580-141083-0043 THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MILES MC CLELLAREN
1580-141083-0044 I DO NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
1580-141083-0045 HE WAS SOON SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
1580-141083-0046 BUT WE HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
1580-141083-0047 COULD YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
1580-141083-0048 HOW CAME YE TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR
1580-141083-0049 ANY ONE IN THIS ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR
1580-141083-0050 I REALLY DON'T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT YOU MISTER HOLMES
1580-141083-0051 ONLY AFTER A MINUTE OR SO
1580-141083-0052 ONLY I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY SIR
1580-141083-0053 YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM NO SAID
1580-141084-0000 IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SILHOUETTE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BLINDS
1580-141084-0001 HE WERE PACING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
1580-141084-0002 THIS SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE BUT IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM
1580-141084-0003 NO NAMES PLEASE SAID HOLMES AS YOU KNOCKED AT GILCRIST'S DOOR
1580-141084-0004 OF COURSE HE COULD NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
1580-141084-0005 HE IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOLMES
1580-141084-0006 YOU DONT SEEM TO REALIZE THE POSITION
1580-141084-0007 TO WHOM IS THE EXAMINATION
1580-141084-0008 I WILL NOT ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
1580-141084-0009 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION YET TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
1580-141084-0010 I WILL TAKE THE BACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTINGS GOOD BYE
1580-141084-0011 WHEN THEY WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
1580-141084-0012 THE FOUL MOUTHED FELLOW TO THE TOP
1580-141084-0013 HERE IS THE ONE WITH THE WORST RECORD
1580-141084-0014 WHY BANNISTER THE SERVANT WHAT'S HIS GAME THE MATTER
1580-141084-0015 IT IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST MAN
1580-141084-0016 MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS OF HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION
1580-141084-0017 NO NOT GOOD MY DEAR WATSON
1580-141084-0018 I THINK SO AND YOU HAVE FORMED A CONCLUSION
1580-141084-0019 YES MY DEAR WATSON YOU HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY
1580-141084-0020 LOOK ON THAT HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
1580-141084-0021 ON THE TOMB WERE THREE LITTLE PYRAMIDS OF BLACK DOUGHY CLAY
1580-141084-0022 BUT ONE MORE THIS MORNING
1580-141084-0023 IN A FEW HOURS THIS EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP
1580-141084-0024 HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE WENT TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
1580-141084-0025 YOU KNOW HIM AND I THINK SO
1580-141084-0026 IF THIS MATTER IS NOW TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARTIAL
1580-141084-0027 NO NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT
1580-141084-0028 AND THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
1580-141084-0029 HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY ON BANNISTER IN THE FURTHER CORNER
1580-141084-0030 JUST REACH THE DOOR SAID HOLMES
1580-141084-0031 WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GILCRIST HOW YOU AN HONOURABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH A ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
1580-141084-0032 FOR A MOMENT GILCRET WITH UPRAISED HANDS TRIED TO CONTROL HIS WRITHING FEATURES
1580-141084-0033 COME COME SAYS HOLMES KINDLY IT IS HUMAN TO ERR AND AT LEAST NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A CALLOUS CRIMINAL
1580-141084-0034 VERY WELL DON'T TROUBLE TO ANSWER LISTEN AND SEE THAT I DO YOU NO INJUSTICE
1580-141084-0035 HE COULD EXAMINE THE PAPERS IN HIS OWN HOUSE
1580-141084-0036 THE INDIAN IS ALSO THOUGHT NOTHING OF
1580-141084-0037 WHEN I APPROACHED HIS ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW
1580-141084-0038 NO ONE LESS THAN HE WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
1580-141084-0039 I ENTERED AND I TOOK HIM INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE SIDE TABLE
1580-141084-0040 HE RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE DIVIDED AS YOU ARE AWARE WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES
1580-141084-0041 NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED MY DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
1580-141084-0042 A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ANSWER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THE PROOFS
1580-141084-0043 I PUT HIS SHOES ON THE TABLE
1580-141084-0044 GLOVES SAID YOUNG MAN
1580-141084-0045 HE HEARD HIM AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE
1580-141084-0046 HAVE I TOLD THE TRUTH MASTER GILCREST
1580-141084-0047 I HAVE A LETTER HERE MISTER HOLMES WHICH I WROTE TO YOU EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTLESS NIGHT
1580-141084-0048 IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU SHOULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
1580-141084-0049 IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW
1580-141084-0050 IF MISTER SOLMES KNEW THEM THE GAME WAS UP
1995-1826-0000 IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIORS SOCIETIES HER DEFENSE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
1995-1826-0001 THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY IN MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLEANS
1995-1826-0002 MISS TAYLOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTON
1995-1826-0003 BETTER GO HE HAD CONQUERED SENTENTIOUSLY
1995-1826-0004 NOW LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL DOWN THERE
1995-1826-0005 BUT JOHN THERE'S NO SOCIETY JUST ELEMENTARY WORKING
1995-1826-0006 BEING LOOKING UP TOMBES COUNTY
1995-1826-0007 FIND SOME CRESS SWELLS THERE BIG PLANTATIONS RATED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
1995-1826-0008 SOME OTHERS TOO BIG COTTON CAMPY
1995-1826-0009 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES I'LL SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY CLASS
1995-1826-0010 AT ANY RATE I SAYS GO
1995-1826-0011 HERE SHE WAS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODOURS AND POSSIBLY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE
1995-1826-0012 SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS TO TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS
1995-1826-0013 SO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TO MORROW AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE BOTTOMS
1995-1826-0014 COTTON HE PAUSED
1995-1826-0015 SHE HAD ALWAYS FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TOUCH AND SIGHT
1995-1826-0016 THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE US STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD
1995-1826-0017 THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS JUST DESPERATE PROSE
1995-1826-0018 HIS REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
1995-1826-0019 COTTON IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER TREMBLINGLY
1995-1826-0020 MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTONS BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARK SEEMED CALLED FOR
1995-1826-0021 DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LITTERALLY BORN AND COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO
1995-1826-0022 I S'POSE THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSIONS
1995-1826-0023 GOOBLES DON'T GROW ON DE TOPS OF VINES BUT ON DE GROUND ON DE ROOTS LIKE YAMS IS SO
1995-1826-0024 THAT GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HEARKENED
1995-1826-0025 SOMETIME YOU'LL TAKE ME PLEASE WON'T YOU
1995-1826-0026 NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING ONE
1995-1836-0000 THE HONOURABLE GEORGE SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLEY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
1995-1836-0001 AT LAST A COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE
1995-1836-0002 WHY SHOULD HE NOT BECOME AS OTHER MEN
1995-1836-0003 SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE AND OTHERS
1995-1836-0004 AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESTS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TO NIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CRIFTON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CRITON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY
1995-1836-0005 MISSUS GRAY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO THE POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH
1995-1836-0006 SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CARSWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION
1995-1836-0007 DO YOU BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ANSWERED MARY TAYLOR
1995-1836-0008 I BELIEVE ON THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM
1995-1836-0009 BUT CRESWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN RANKS
1995-1836-0010 THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMEN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GREY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDING TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM
1995-1836-0011 POSITIVELY HEROICAL ADDED CRESWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES
1995-1836-0012 BUT WE'LL NOT ER EXACTLY WELCOME
1995-1836-0013 MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZORA TO MISTER GRAY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER
1995-1836-0014 FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A VERY MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
1995-1837-0000 HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS AND ZORRA'S MUST BE RUINED
1995-1837-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY OF HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT
1995-1837-0002 AH A SWAMP THE CRUEL SWAMP
1995-1837-0003 THAT REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER
1995-1837-0004 HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED BUT KNEW NOT
1995-1837-0005 SHE WAS SO STRANGE AND KEEN A CREATURE
1995-1837-0006 THE WORLD WAS WATER BOILED IN MISTS
1995-1837-0007 AND THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STEAMED
1995-1837-0008 BUT WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING
1995-1837-0009 THE LAGOONS HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DIKES A WEEK AGO AND NOW
1995-1837-0010 AND PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEEPING
1995-1837-0011 HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH GLADLY
1995-1837-0012 HE SPLASHED AND STUMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
1995-1837-0013 THEN HE LOOKED DOWN A LAGOON WAS DRY
1995-1837-0014 HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREEN SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWY
1995-1837-0015 THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BOTTLES
1995-1837-0016 FOR ONE LONG MOMENT THEY PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST A TREE
1995-1837-0017 HE GAZED ABOUT HIM PERPLEXED ASTONISHED
1995-1837-0018 HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAINS SOME ONE HAD DUG A CANAL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK TO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
1995-1837-0019 HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST RATHER
1995-1837-0020 THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER AGONY WERE TEN
1995-1837-0021 THE HOPE AND DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THAT LAND
1995-1837-0022 UP IN THE SICK ROOM ZORA LAID ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED
1995-1837-0023 THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DIM SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED
1995-1837-0024 FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AT THE SUN AND BIRD AND TREE
1995-1837-0025 SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUSLY SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
1995-1837-0026 SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE MET HER LOVE
1995-1837-0027 ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LO THE CARDINAL LAY BEFORE HER
1995-1837-0028 THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE LOOKED
1995-1837-0029 THEY DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE
2094-142345-0000 IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOOR ITSELF
2094-142345-0001 BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
2094-142345-0002 FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEYOND THE LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR
2094-142345-0003 A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS
2094-142345-0004 AND WHAT THROUGH A LEFT HAND WINDOW
2094-142345-0005 SEVERAL CLOTHES ALSO A PILLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLORED RAGS
2094-142345-0006 AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF THE NOSE
2094-142345-0007 THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS CLEAR NOW
2094-142345-0008 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT WAS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE
2094-142345-0009 FOR THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY THE WHITTAW OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TRUDDLESTON GOSSIP
2094-142345-0010 HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A GREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
2094-142345-0011 DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY OF FAIR COMPLEXIONS AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHT FOOTED
2094-142345-0012 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR MARTHA AND MARIAN
2094-142345-0013 HER TONGUE WAS NO LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
2094-142345-0014 THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WHIPDOWS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
2094-142345-0015 TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW BEGAN TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME
2094-142345-0016 SPINNING IT INDEED
2094-142345-0017 I NEVER KNEW YOUR EQUALS FOR A GALLOWS
2094-142345-0018 WHO TAUGHT YOU TO SCRUB THIS FLOOR I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
2094-142345-0019 COMB THE WOOL FOR THE WOODAWS IN DEED
2094-142345-0020 THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO BE DOING IS IT
2094-142345-0021 THAT'S THE WAY WITH YOU THAT'S A ROAD YOU'D ALL LIKE TO GO HEADLONG'S TO RUIN
2094-142345-0022 MISTER OARLEY'S INDEED
2094-142345-0023 YOU ARE A RAREAN FOR SITTING DOWN TO YOUR WORK A LITTLE WHILE AFTER ITS TIME TO PUT BY
2094-142345-0024 MONEY MY IRONS TWIGHT TOLD PETERS PUT IT DOWN TO WARM
2094-142345-0025 COLD IS IT MY DARLING BLESS YOUR SWEET FACES
2094-142345-0026 SHE'S GOING TO PUT THE IRONIN THINGS AWAY
2094-142345-0027 MONEY I UD LIKE TO GO INTO THE BARN TO TOMMY TO SEE THE WIDOWED
2094-142345-0028 NO NO NO TOTTY'D GOT HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON
2094-142345-0029 DID EVER ANY BODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARD THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
2094-142345-0030 DOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
2094-142345-0031 AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO AUNT ANGEL
2094-142345-0032 I ONCE HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
2094-142345-0033 WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH OF YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO
2094-142345-0034 AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS OF SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TOWLING AND ISN'T MADE UP
2094-142345-0035 BUT NOT MORE THAN IT'S IN THE BIBLE AUNT SAID DINAH
2094-142345-0036 NAY DEAR AUNT YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK AND THEIR FAMILIES
2094-142345-0037 WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR LOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE FITS US FOR IT AND CALLS US INTO IT
2094-142345-0038 I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
2094-142345-0039 I'VE STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANY THING I HAVE DONE
2094-142345-0040 I DIDN'T PREACH WITHOUT A DIRECTION
2094-142345-0041 DIRECTION ONE
2094-142345-0042 I HAVE HAD A COMMON PATIENCE WITH YOU
2094-142345-0043 BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT WAS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO GET IN
2094-142345-0044 SAID DOCTOR IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY
2094-142345-0045 OH SO DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0046 I DELIGHT IN THIS KITCHEN
2094-142345-0047 POYSER IS NOT AT HOME IS IT
2094-142345-0048 SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE CAN SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR
2094-142345-0049 NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSITUR TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR AT THE WOOL
2094-142345-0050 THEN THERE'S FATHER IN THE BARN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE
2094-142345-0051 NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WHELPS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT THEM FOR YOUR SHEPHERD
2094-142345-0052 I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE HER HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES
2094-142345-0053 FOR IF HE'S ANYWHERE IN THE FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE
2094-142345-0054 OH YES SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
2094-142345-0055 WELL YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO SIR
2094-142345-0056 I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU THE SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
2094-142345-0057 I KNOW HIS FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE CHICKEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT
2094-142345-0058 BY THE BYE I'VE NEVER SEE YOUR DAIRY I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0059 THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADOPT HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
2094-142345-0060 NOW I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER
2300-131720-0000 THE PARIS PLANT LIKE THAT AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY GIFT
2300-131720-0001 THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TERRIBLE BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT
2300-131720-0002 HERE MESSRS JOHNSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
2300-131720-0003 THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE THIRTEEN YEARS
2300-131720-0004 OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON A LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
2300-131720-0005 WHY IF WE ERECT A STATION IN THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
2300-131720-0006 THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT WILL CHANGE
2300-131720-0007 BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT HIS GATE
2300-131720-0008 EVERYTHING SHE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
2300-131720-0009 FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS OR ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
2300-131720-0010 IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DISTRIBUTION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
2300-131720-0011 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTS A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARMHOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
2300-131720-0012 EDISON IS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALVANOMETER
2300-131720-0013 UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE THE STEADY LIGHT
2300-131720-0014 MISTER ADAM WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
2300-131720-0015 HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR A INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT
2300-131720-0016 THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THIS SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
2300-131720-0017 EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY THIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND
2300-131720-0018 HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENINGS BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
2300-131720-0019 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THIS STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
2300-131720-0020 IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECTS FOR CONGRATULATION
2300-131720-0021 THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLICE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS
2300-131720-0022 ANYHOW HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
2300-131720-0023 I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OR THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
2300-131720-0024 BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRES STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
2300-131720-0025 THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF EDUCONIA BUT THEY REMAINED IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2300-131720-0026 THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOUR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
2300-131720-0027 EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A MEMBER
2300-131720-0028 THERE WAS INFINITE SCEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GIVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
2300-131720-0029 HENCE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTICATER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
2300-131720-0030 THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METRE WAS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
2300-131720-0031 ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENTS OR DAMAGE
2300-131720-0032 THE STANDARD EDISON METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER TEST BEING SUBSTITUTED
2300-131720-0033 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH HER METRE THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
2300-131720-0034 THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO RAN QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BASIS
2300-131720-0035 IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN THE STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METRE
2300-131720-0036 THE METRE CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
2300-131720-0037 HE WEIGHED AND REWAYED THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
2300-131720-0038 SHE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
2300-131720-0039 THE PROBLEM SEEMED SOLVED
2300-131720-0040 WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THAT STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART
2300-131720-0041 WE HAD MET AS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
237-126133-0000 HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE HARRY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME
237-126133-0001 EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WINDS TO THE FLOWERS
237-126133-0002 THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF US TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
237-126133-0003 SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN HER HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
237-126133-0004 IF SHE COULD ONLY HEAR PHRONSIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
237-126133-0005 OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THAT PIANO SAID VAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED
237-126133-0006 AT THIS THE BUNDLES OPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE
237-126133-0007 BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL OF PHRONSIE AND ALL
237-126133-0008 ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE TO PAPA'S OWN
237-126133-0009 NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED VAN SAY TOM WON'T YOU
237-126133-0010 OH YOU'RE THE DEAREST AND BEST MISTER KING I EVER SAW BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE MAMMY LET HER COME
237-126133-0011 ISN'T HE SPLENDID CRIED JASPER IN INTENSE PRIDE SWELLING AT FATHER KNEW HOW TO DO IT
237-126133-0012 THERE THERE HE SAID SMOOTHINGLY PATTING HER BROWN FUZZY HEAD
237-126133-0013 I KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLLING HER SOBS I WON'T ONLY I CAN'T THINK YOU
237-126133-0014 ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF SYLVIA'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE
237-126133-0015 YES ALL ALONE BY HERSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE
237-126133-0016 OH NO JAXER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF
237-126133-0017 THERE JAP YOU'VE BOUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE
237-126133-0018 DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER TWAS N'T HER FAULT
237-126133-0019 DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET IT HERE TOO
237-126133-0020 HOW DID THE MOTHER EVER LET HER GO
237-126133-0021 SHE EXCLAIMED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER
237-126133-0022 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I TALKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY
237-126133-0023 HE CRIED IN A HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
237-126133-0024 AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OFF INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
237-126133-0025 AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPING HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY
237-134493-0000 IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHN BORGSON DIED
237-134493-0001 HIS WIFE NOW LIES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS HER GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELDS
237-134493-0002 FROM THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHEQUER BOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND BRIGHT
237-134493-0003 FROM THE GRAVEYARD GATE ONE CAN COUNT A DOZEN GAILY PAINTED FARMHOUSES THE GILDED WINTER VEINS ON THE BIG RED BARNS WINK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0004 THE AIR AND THE EARTH IS CURIOUSLY MATED AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
237-134493-0005 HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A GIRL TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GRAY EYES DEEPLY SET UNDER A SERIOUS BROW
237-134493-0006 THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A JOB FOR AN ATHLETE HERE I'VE BEEN IN TOWN AND BACK
237-134493-0007 ALEXANDRA LETS YOU SLEEP LATER
237-134493-0008 SHE GOT UP HER REINS
237-134493-0009 PLEASE WAIT FOR ME MARIE AMIR COAXED
237-134493-0010 I NEVER SEE EWE'S SCYTHE OVER HERE
237-134493-0011 HOW BROWN YOU'VE GOT SINCE WE CAME HOME I WISH I HAD AN ATHLETE TO MOW MY ORCHARD
237-134493-0012 I GET WET ON MY KNEES WHEN I GO DOWN TO PICK CHERRIES
237-134493-0013 INDEED SHE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT SEEING IT
237-134493-0014 I THINK YOU'RE PROUD BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY TO SCHOOL OR SOMETHING
237-134493-0015 THERE WAS SOMETHING INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE WHOLE FARM A MOST UNUSUAL TRIMNESS AND CARE FOR DETAIL
237-134493-0016 ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A MILE BEFORE YOU REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL STOOD TALL OSAGE ORANGE HEDGES THEIR GLOSSY GREEN MARKING OF THE YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0017 ANY ONE THEREABOUTS COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FARMS ON THE DIVIDE AND THAT THE FARMER WAS A WOMAN ALEXANDRA BERGSON
237-134493-0018 THERE IS EVEN A BRIGHT ROW OF BEEHIVES IN THE ORCHARD UNDER THE WALNUT TREES
237-134500-0000 FRANK RAN ENGLISH SLOWLY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORCE CASE THE ANGRIER HE GREW
237-134500-0001 MARNY SIGHED
237-134500-0002 A BRISK WIND HAD GONE UP AND WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
237-134500-0003 THIS ORCHARD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING IN THE SUN
237-134500-0004 THAT INVITATION DECIDED THEM
237-134500-0005 OH BUT I' AM GLAD TO GET THIS PLACE MOWED
237-134500-0006 JUST SMELL THE WILD ROSES THERE ARE ALWAYS SO SPICY AFTER A RAIN
237-134500-0007 WE NEVER HAD SO MANY OF THEM WERE HERE BEFORE
237-134500-0008 I SUPPOSE IT'S THE WET SEASON WILL YOU HAVE TO CUT HIM TOO
237-134500-0009 I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE WET SEASON TWO THEN
237-134500-0010 IT'S EXCITING TO SEE EVERYTHING GROWING SO FAST AND TO SEE THE GRASS CUT
237-134500-0011 AREN'T YOU SPLASHED LOOK AT THE SPIDER WEBS ALL OVER THIS GRASS
237-134500-0012 IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD HEARD THE CHERRIES DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PAIL AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SCYTHE WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYS EVER LEARN
237-134500-0013 MARIE KISSED CHERRIES AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING BRANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE CAUGHT A SHOWER OF RAIN DROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR
237-134500-0014 AND AMILL MOWED HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
237-134500-0015 THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN SHABATER AND HIS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS
237-134500-0016 I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW LYNDON'S ARE
237-134500-0017 IF I FEEL THAT WAY I FEELS THAT WAY
237-134500-0018 HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INSIPID FRUIT LONG IVORY COLORED BERRIES TIPPED WITH FAINT PINK LIKE WHITE CORAL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDING ALL SUMMER THROUGH
237-134500-0019 HE DROPT A HANDFUL INTO HER LAP
237-134500-0020 YOU YES DON'T YOU
237-134500-0021 OH EVER SO MUCH ONLY HE SEEMS KIND OF STAID AND SCHOOL TEACHERED
237-134500-0022 WHEN SHE USED TO TELL ME OF HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER SHE WASN'T A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM
237-134500-0023 IT WOULD SERVE ME ALL RIGHT IF SHE WALKED OFF WITH KARL
237-134500-0024 I WANT TO TALK TO KARL ABOUT NEW YORK AND WHAT A FELLOW CAN DO THERE
237-134500-0025 O AMEL
237-134500-0026 SURELY YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF GOING OFF THERE
237-134500-0027 MARIE'S FACE FELT UNDER HIS BROODING GAZE
237-134500-0028 I'M SURE ALEXANDRA HOPES YOU WILL STAY UPON HERE SHE MURMURED
237-134500-0029 I DON'T WANT TO STAND ACROSS AND LOOK ON
237-134500-0030 I WANT TO BE DOING ANYTHING ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
237-134500-0031 SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A TABLE TOP
237-134500-0032 I GET TIRED OF SEEING MEN AND BOYS GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN
237-134500-0033 I WISH YOU WEREN'T SO RESTLESS AND DIDN'T GET SO WORKED UP ABOUT THINGS SHE SAID SADLY
237-134500-0034 NO THANK YOU HE RETURNED SHORTLY
237-134500-0035 AND YOU NEVER USED TO BE CROSS AT ME
237-134500-0036 I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU LIKE A LITTLE BOY ANY MORE HE SAID SLOWLY THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY MARIE
237-134500-0037 BUT AMILF I UNDERSTAND THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE
237-134500-0038 AND ANYHOW HOW THERE'S NOTHING TO UNDERSTAND
237-134500-0039 THAT WON'T LAST IT WILL GO AWAY AND THINGS WILL BE JUST AS THEY USED TO ARE
237-134500-0040 I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAYED YES
237-134500-0041 I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT SHE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT
237-134500-0042 THEN ALL OUR GREAT TIMES ARE OVER
260-123286-0000 SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE AIR UNBROKEN ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT
260-123286-0001 THE HORIZON SEEMS ESPECIALLY DISTANT
260-123286-0002 ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NAME HAS RESUMED ITS SWAY
260-123286-0003 YOU SEEM ANGRY MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE ANXIOUS
260-123286-0004 ONE MIGHT BE OF LESS REASON THAN NOW
260-123286-0005 I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE RATE IS SMALL BUT THAT THE SEA IS SO WIDE
260-123286-0006 WE ARE LOSING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A BOND ON A RAFT
260-123286-0007 HE CALL THIS SEA A PAWN AND OUR LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL
260-123286-0008 THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT DREAMS AND PROSPECTS
260-123286-0009 I TAKE THIS AS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BIDE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
260-123286-0010 SUNDAY AUGUST SIXTEENTH D
260-123286-0011 NOTHING NEW THOUGH UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESHENS
260-123286-0012 THEN THERE SEEMED NO REASON OF FEAR
260-123286-0013 THE SHADOW OF THE VAULT WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
260-123286-0014 TRULY THE SCENE IS OF INFINITE WIDTH
260-123286-0015 THEY MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT
260-123286-0016 THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY BUT MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALMED DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOURS SLEEP
260-123286-0017 I SHUDDERS AS I RECALL THESE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE
260-123286-0018 I SAW AT THE HUMBURG MUSEUM THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
260-123286-0019 I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PEN HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE TO SIDE
260-123286-0020 TUESDAY AUGUST EIGHTEENST
260-123286-0021 DURING HIS WALK I SLEPT
260-123286-0022 TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK AWAKENED ME
260-123286-0023 THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED DOWN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS
260-123286-0024 THERE'S A WHALE A WHALE CRIED THE MASTER
260-123286-0025 FLIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REPTILES ROSE THEY WHIRLED ABOUT OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESS TRAINS
260-123286-0026 TWO MONSTERS ONLY WERE CREATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO REPTILES OF THE PRIMITIVE SORT
260-123286-0027 I COULD DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF THE ICHTHEOSAURUS GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT COAL AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
260-123286-0028 ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING TO NATURALISTS IT WAS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH
260-123286-0029 THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACKED EACH OTHER WITH GREAT ANIMOSITY
260-123286-0030 SUDDENLY THE ICHTHEOSAURUS AND THE PLECIOSAURUS DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WHIRLPOOL EDDYING IN THE WATER
260-123286-0031 AS FOR THE ITHISAURUS HAS HE RETURNED TO HIS SUBMARINE CAVERN
260-123288-0000 THE ROARINGS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCES
260-123288-0001 THE WEATHER IF WE MAY USE THE TERM CHANGE BEFORE LONG
260-123288-0002 THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPOURS PERVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SAILING WATER
260-123288-0003 THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE THROUGH THE DENSE CURTAIN WHICH IS DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
260-123288-0004 THE RAIN IS HEAVY THE SEA IS CALM
260-123288-0005 FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEECY TUFT OF MISTS WITH YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPS DOWN UPON THE DENSE FLOOR OF GREEN AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OPAQUE AND IMPENETRABLE MASS
260-123288-0006 THE ATMOSPHERE IS EVIDENTLY CHARGED WITH SURCHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY
260-123288-0007 THE WIND NEVER LULLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RESERVOIR OF FEARFUL WINDY GUSTS AND RUSHING STREAMS
260-123288-0008 THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I REPLIED POINTING TOWARD THE HORIZON
260-123288-0009 THOSE CLOUDS SEEM AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEAS
260-123288-0010 ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF ALAMAN OF SAINT IUBEL'S FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF LEAD
260-123288-0011 BUT IF WE HAVE NOW SEEMED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF A TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT
260-123288-0012 THAT SHALL BE THE SAFEST NO NO NEVER
260-123288-0013 THE PILED UP VAPOURS CONDENSED INTO WATER AND THE AIR PUT IN VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACUUM LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE MISTS ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0014 HANS FURS NOT
260-123288-0015 FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THEY ARE CONTINUAL EMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLECULES THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
260-123288-0016 I REFER TO THE THERMOMETER IT INDICATES THE FIGURE AS OBLITERATED
260-123288-0017 IS THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED ITS SEVENSITY TO BECOME FINAL
260-123288-0018 THE RAFT BEARS UP STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
260-123288-0019 AT NOON THE VIOLENCES OF THE STORM REDOUBLES
260-123288-0020 EACH OF US IS LASHED TO SOME PART OF THIS RAFT
260-123288-0021 THE WAVES RISE ABOVE MY HEADS
260-123288-0022 THEY SEEM TO KNOW WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
260-123288-0023 HE NODS WITH CONSENT
260-123288-0024 THE FIRE BALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN INCH SHELL MOVED SLOWLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0025 HERE IT COMES THERE IT GLIDES NOW IT'S UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THENCE IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZINE HORRIBLE
260-123288-0026 WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLY LEAPS ASIDE IT REACHES HANS WHO FIXES HIS BLUE EYE UPON IT STEADILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
260-123288-0027 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF VITROGEN FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FILLS THE LUNGS
260-123288-0028 WE SUFFER STIFLING PAYS
260-123440-0000 AND HOW HONEST THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK
260-123440-0001 POOR JESUS
260-123440-0002 IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WITH A PAIR OF WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG IN A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUCHESS THE PRINCESS
260-123440-0003 OH WON'T SHE BE SELFISH IF I'VE KEPT HER WAITING
260-123440-0004 ALICE TOOK UP FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TODAY
260-123440-0005 AND YESTERDAY THINGS RAN ON JUST AS USUAL
260-123440-0006 I WONDER I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
260-123440-0007 I ALMOST THINK I CAN REMEMBER FEELING A LITTLE TIRED
260-123440-0008 I'LL TRY IF I CAN KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW
260-123440-0009 I SHALL NEVER GET AT TWENTY AT THAT RATE
260-123440-0010 HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN NOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS
260-123440-0011 NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT IF I'VE MABEL I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
260-123440-0012 IT'LL BE NO USE THEIR PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME ON AGAIN DEAR
260-123440-0013 I AM SO MUCH TIRED OF BEING ALL ALONE HERE
260-123440-0014 IT I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD THAT IT IS
260-123440-0015 I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY DOWN
260-123440-0016 I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED BY MY OWN TEARS
260-123440-0017 THAT WILL BE A SWEET THING TO BE SURE
260-123440-0018 I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE O MOUNT
260-123440-0019 CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY ATTENDED
260-123440-0020 WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE DO INDEED
2830-3979-0000 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH THIS LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAM IN HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0002 LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY UPON GALATIONS
2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME ATTRACTIVE
2830-3979-0004 BUT IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
2830-3979-0005 THE WAY HAD TO BE CONDENSED
2830-3979-0006 A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ONGS
2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GALATION FOR INSTANCE
2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND RORA PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNING FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE
2830-3979-0010 BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS IT
2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SAVE AND TO DO LUKE TWO
2830-3979-0012 THE WORD OF OUR GOD WILL STAND FOREVER
2830-3980-0000 IN ANY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
2830-3980-0001 THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGH OF PAUL
2830-3980-0002 HE WAS THE NEXT TO TURN TO CHRIST
2830-3980-0003 PAUL CAME LATER AND IT IS BENEATH US
2830-3980-0004 INDEED HE HAD PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0005 BUT YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
2830-3980-0006 AGAINST THESE BOASTING AND FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY AND MINISTRY
2830-3980-0007 AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICES AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
2830-3980-0008 PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PREJUDICE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009 AND PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
2830-3980-0010 EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECT AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES
2830-3980-0011 PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY A MAN
2830-3980-0012 THE MOST THEY SHOULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013 HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY WITH GOD
2830-3980-0014 MY CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
2830-3980-0015 OF A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
2830-3980-0016 IT SPOILS ONE'S LAST WORK
2830-3980-0017 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS TALK
2830-3980-0018 I DID NOT NOW REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
2830-3980-0019 I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL POSTING
2830-3980-0020 THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS FOOLISH PRIDE
2830-3980-0021 THEN GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
2830-3980-0022 THE CLALL SEEMED SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0023 THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST RESPECT THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
2830-3980-0024 IN THIS SAME EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0025 BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LIFE SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0026 FIRST ONE
2830-3980-0027 AND ALL THE BRETHREN WHICH IS WITH ME
2830-3980-0028 THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF A FALSE APOSTLES
2830-3980-0029 ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK READ AND TEACH AS I DO
2830-3980-0030 THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY KNOW WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE
2830-3980-0031 WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS I HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0032 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EARS HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
2830-3980-0033 NOT ALL THE LAATIONS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
2830-3980-0034 OUR MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED
2830-3980-0035 THEY ALMOST DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
2830-3980-0036 AND WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNS THERE
2830-3980-0037 SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE TWO
2830-3980-0038 GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD A FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0039 THE TERMS OF CHRIST AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2830-3980-0040 THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS REFRESHING AND
2830-3980-0041 THE GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042 THE WORLD BRANDS THAT A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
2830-3980-0043 EXPERIENCE PROVES THE
2830-3980-0044 WHETHER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL
2830-3980-0045 MEN DID NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0046 WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SEEK FROM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0047 TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ONLY BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0048 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND YET HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
2830-3980-0049 EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE CHURCH OF GOD
2830-3980-0050 DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY OF THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
2830-3980-0051 WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTIONS OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
2830-3980-0052 WE HAVE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053 AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST WAS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0054 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN WHICH PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
2830-3980-0055 TO BESTOW PEACE OR GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
2830-3980-0056 OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER IN PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0057 THE ARIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY IT GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
2830-3980-0058 MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF GOD
2830-3980-0059 PAUL STICKED TO HIS THEME
2830-3980-0060 AND NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLE
2830-3980-0061 NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PERSIA LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062 NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR ALL GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0063 UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT TO SORE CONSCIENCES
2830-3980-0064 HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF ALL SINS
2830-3980-0065 PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST IN THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0066 SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
2830-3980-0067 THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
2830-3980-0068 THE GREENNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
2830-3980-0069 THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THESE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0070 THEN WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
2830-3980-0071 WE THINK THAT BY SO LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN
2830-3980-0072 THE PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
2830-3980-0073 THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MIGHT FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0074 THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPS IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
2830-3980-0075 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON ME
2830-3980-0076 ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT THEY MUST DESPAIR
2961-960-0000 HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO THEM FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE
2961-960-0001 THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY WAS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0002 IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEOLATINISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CONNECTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO
2961-960-0003 THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC IN THEM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
2961-960-0004 THERE WAS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEOPLATINISTS
2961-960-0005 AT THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
2961-960-0006 THE FANCIES OF THE NEOPLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAYS
2961-960-0007 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN THEIR SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0008 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WERE EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
2961-960-0009 THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG ANIMALS
2961-960-0010 BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN GRANTING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
2961-960-0011 WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE ANEXAGORRAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
2961-960-0012 MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THIS PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS
2961-960-0013 IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
2961-960-0014 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRD FISHES
2961-960-0015 THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATOIC DIALOGUES
2961-960-0016 BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PHIDRUS OR SYMPOSIUM
2961-960-0017 NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THAT INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
2961-960-0018 BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS COMPLETELY GIVEN UP
2961-960-0019 HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER IN THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
2961-960-0020 AND YET WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS
2961-960-0021 THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S WRITINGS
2961-960-0022 PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF ITS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
2961-961-0000 SOCRATES CONTINUES THE TIMAEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC
2961-961-0001 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN ONE GREAT STRUGGLE
2961-961-0002 AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITEUS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
2961-961-0003 I WILL IF TIMAEUS APPROVES I APPROACH
2961-961-0004 LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SAENS WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF TROPIDUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME
2961-961-0005 SOME POEMS OF SALOON WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
2961-961-0006 AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEM SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARKS
2961-961-0007 THAT SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
2961-961-0008 THAT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS
2961-961-0009 TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SALON HEARD THIS STORY
2961-961-0010 BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TABLES
2961-961-0011 THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNALS SALLY ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY
2961-961-0012 FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITY AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
2961-961-0013 SOUTHERN MARVELED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
2961-961-0014 NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND TWO THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED OURS AS OUR ANNALS RECORD
2961-961-0015 MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THAT OLDEN TIME
2961-961-0016 I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT OUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS
2961-961-0017 OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE THE LAW DID IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN
2961-961-0018 THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THIS ISLAND OF ATLANTIS
2961-961-0019 FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE OTHER HELLENES HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF THEIR OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS
2961-961-0020 THIS IS THE DISTINCTION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
2961-961-0021 BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME FOR I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
2961-961-0022 THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENTS FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORDS SPOKE
3570-5694-0000 BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE NATION SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM
3570-5694-0001 THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION IS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH
3570-5694-0002 SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOR AND NOT THE CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULNESS OF LIFE
3570-5694-0003 WITH THE FURTHER ADVANCE OF CULTURE THIS TABOO MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABOO OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
3570-5694-0004 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LATER CLASS
3570-5694-0005 UNDER THE TABOO CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THEIR SUPERIOR CLASS
3570-5694-0006 DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THIS INDULGENCE
3570-5694-0007 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR SIMPLE
3570-5694-0008 THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE FACT
3570-5694-0009 WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS HELD TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
3570-5694-0010 THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THIS SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL
3570-5694-0011 THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT AND THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
3570-5694-0012 THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF FRANK AND GRATES
3570-5694-0013 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS RENDERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
3570-5694-0014 MANY OF THOSE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS
3570-5694-0015 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMED WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
3570-5694-0016 MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANT RETAINERS ET CETERA
3570-5694-0017 THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MATTER OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
3570-5694-0018 THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE BUT THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
3570-5694-0019 BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
3570-5694-0020 SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LABOUR CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS
3570-5694-0021 WHEN EVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONORIFIC CHARACTER
3570-5694-0022 THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO READ IT
3570-5695-0000 IN A GENERAL WAY THO NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE
3570-5695-0001 THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHERE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
3570-5695-0002 AND AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
3570-5695-0003 IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE RUSSIAN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
3570-5695-0004 IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES THROUGH THAT GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT
3570-5695-0005 THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCE AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY
3570-5695-0006 VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THAT LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENSE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY
3570-5695-0007 THERE IS NO CLASS IN NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
3570-5695-0008 THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE COMMISSIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT
3570-5695-0009 EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGE OF SOCIAL GROWTH
3570-5695-0010 THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER SIDE
3570-5695-0011 IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF PARTICULAR CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
3570-5695-0012 IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THAT COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
3570-5695-0013 CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THE STANDARDS OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
3570-5695-0014 AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEGRO GOSSIPS SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE
3570-5695-0015 THE RESULT WAS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
3570-5696-0000 UNDER THE SINGLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
3570-5696-0001 BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE CORSIE PEACEABLE CULTURE
3570-5696-0002 OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOUR UPON PROTECTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
3570-5696-0003 A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS EFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MANY INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMELIORATION EMBODIED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STYLE AND TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TORPES MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
3570-5696-0004 THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC LIFE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
3570-5696-0005 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE REVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND A CONSUMER'S GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
3570-5696-0006 IS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERY DAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0007 THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY A CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
3570-5696-0008 AND IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERY DAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL
3570-5696-0009 IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURES AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
3570-5696-0010 AN ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH BUT ITS UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS
3575-170457-0000 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE IN HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
3575-170457-0001 OH ARE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY
3575-170457-0002 WHY ARE WE TO BE DELIGHTED
3575-170457-0003 SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE'RE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR AN IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
3575-170457-0004 WE USED TO DISPUTE ABOUT POLITICS AND RELIGIOUS
3575-170457-0005 SHE A TORIAN CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN MY HOUSE OF VIOLENT DESCENT AND RADICALISM
3575-170457-0006 HER FEEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE ANY ONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL THE STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
3575-170457-0007 HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY IN SPEAKING THE BROADEST YORKSHIRE
3575-170457-0008 AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENT RADICALS AND DISSENTERS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS REALLY LOVED AND HONOURED
3575-170457-0009 JANUARY AND FEBRUARY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM SOUTHEY
3575-170457-0010 I AM NOT DEPRECIATING IT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE TIMES IT IS NOT REAL
3575-170457-0011 BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW OF DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN HAPPINESS
3575-170457-0012 YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION THERE MAY BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
3575-170457-0013 THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LESS LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT ONLY AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
3575-170457-0014 TO HIS DUTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR CELEBRITY
3575-170457-0015 AND DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARAGE THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM EXERCISING IT I ONLY EXHORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCIVE TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD
3575-170457-0016 FAREWELL MARIAN
3575-170457-0017 THOUGH I MAY BE BUT AN UNGRACIOUS ADVISER YOU WILL ALLOW ME THEREFORE TO SUBSCRIBE MYSELF WITH THE BEST WISHES FOR YOUR HAPPINESS HERE AND HEREAFTER YOUR TRUE FRIENDS ROBERT SOUTHEY
3575-170457-0018 OH MARCH SIXTEENTH
3575-170457-0019 I HAVE NOT VENTURED TO HOPE FOR SUCH A REPLY SO CONSIDERATE IN ITS TONE SO NOBLE IN HIS SPIRIT
3575-170457-0020 I KNOW THE FIRST LETTER I WROTE TO YOU IS ALL SENSELESS TRASH FROM BEGINNING TO END BUT I AM NOT ALTOGETHER THE IDLE DREAMING BEING IT WOULD SEEM TO DENOTE IT
3575-170457-0021 I THOUGHT IT THEREFORE MY DUTY WHEN I HAD LEFT SCHOOL TO BECOME A GOVERNESS
3575-170457-0022 IN THE EVENINGS I CONFESS I DID THINK BUT I NEVER TROUBLE ANYONE ELSE WITH MY THOUGHTS
3575-170457-0023 I CAREFULLY AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PREOCCUPATION AND ECCENTRICITY WHICH MIGHT LEAD THOSE I LIVE AMONGST TO SUSPECT THE NATURE OF OUR PURSUITS
3575-170457-0024 I DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED FOR SOMETIMES WHEN I'M TEACHING OR SEWING I WOULD RATHER BE READING OR WRITING BUT I TRY TO DENY MYSELF AND MY FATHER'S APPROBATION AMPLY REWARDED ME FOR MY PRIVATION
3575-170457-0025 AGAIN I THANK YOU THIS INCIDENT I SUPPOSE WILL BE RENEWED NO MORE IF I LIVE TO BE AN OLD WOMAN I SHALL REMEMBER IT THIRTY YEARS HENCE AS A GREAT DREAM
3575-170457-0026 P S PRAY SIR EXCUSE ME FOR WRITING TO YOU A SECOND TIME I COULD NOT HELP WRITING PARTLY TO TELL YOU HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND PARTLY TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOUR ADVICE SHALL NOT BE WASTED HOWEVER SORROWFULLY AND RELUCTANTLY IT MAY BE AT FIRST FOLLOWED C P
3575-170457-0027 I CANNOT DENY HERSELF THE GRATIFICATION OF INSERTING SOUTHEY'S REPLY
3575-170457-0028 KESWICK MARCH TWENTY SECOND EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DE MADAME
3575-170457-0029 YOUR LETTER HAS GIVEN ME GREAT PLEASURE AND I SHOULD NOT FORGIVE MYSELF IF I DID TELL YOU SO
3575-170457-0030 OF THIS SECOND LETTER ALSO SHE SPOKE AND TOLD ME THAT IT CONTAINED AN INVITATION FOR HER TO GO AND SEE THE POET IFEVER SHE VISITED THE LAKES
3575-170457-0031 ON AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SHE DIES
3575-170457-0032 COME NOW I'M GETTING REALLY TIRED OF YOUR ABSENCE
3575-170457-0033 SATURDAY AFTER SATURDAY COMES ROUND AND I CAN HAVE NO HOPE OF HEARING YOUR KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND THEN BEING TOLD THAT MISSUS E IS COME OH DEAR
3575-170457-0034 IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MINE HE WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
3575-170457-0035 I WISH IT WOULD RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS OF ESTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY
3575-170457-0036 MY EYES FILL WITH TEARS WHEN I CONTRAST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE THIS BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WALKING IN THOUGHT AND DEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SMITTEN AT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT GHASTLY CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ARE TRUE DARKENED IN SHORT BY THE VERY SHADOWS OF SPIRITUAL DEATH
3575-170457-0037 IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION IS NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOT BED FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON AN ACTION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REDEEMER FOR DIRECTION
3575-170457-0038 AND MEAN I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JEHOVAH I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY WRONG
3575-170457-0039 THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND ANNA RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELLED UP MORE OR LESS
3575-170457-0040 INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE VISITORS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
3575-170457-0041 SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ERRAND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON THE ICE AND SHE FELL IT WAS DARK AND NO ONE SAW THE MISCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSER BY
3575-170457-0042 UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACTURE CANNOT BE MET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT OUR HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
3575-170457-0043 HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMMENDED THE MATTER TO A HIGHER DECISION THAN OURS AND THAT YOU WERE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT AND IT MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST
3575-170457-0044 AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE MENTION WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
3575-170457-0045 I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TOO INTIMATE ASSOCIATION
3575-170457-0046 A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BRONTE'S A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHIRE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGGIST SHOP IN HAWORTH FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE IN EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTRESS AND NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLDS ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBY'S FRACTURED LEG
3575-170457-0047 TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND IT WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
3575-170457-0048 HE REFUSED AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIVING NATURE
3575-170457-0049 THIS POSITION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
3575-170457-0050 TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THE CHILDHOOD THEY AND NONE OTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY AND AGE
3575-170457-0051 AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THEIR MEAL WENT AWAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
3575-170457-0052 SHE HAD ANOTHER WEIGHT ON HER MIND THIS BUSINESS
3575-170457-0053 BUT AUNT HAD BEGUN TO SUFFER JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCHED OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG
3575-170457-0054 STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRAIDED MISS W FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO ANN'S STATE OF HEALTH
3575-170457-0055 STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAYS SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FOND ANXIETY THAT IS SO FULL OF SUDDEN PANGS OF FEAR
3575-170457-0056 I DOUBT WHETHER BRANWELL WAS MAINTAINED HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
3729-6852-0000 TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3729-6852-0001 WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AND ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
3729-6852-0002 IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBE CONTE AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
3729-6852-0003 MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONISING AIR FOR MY PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SCHEVERA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SKURORA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
3729-6852-0004 HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA FOR IT INSPIRED EVERY ONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF WE EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
3729-6852-0005 SILVIA WAS THE ADORATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MARIVOT FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMEDIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO POSTERITY
3729-6852-0006 SELVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HER SELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY SUPERIORITY TOWARDS HER THEATRICAL SISTERS ALTHOUGH SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TALENT OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR VIRTUE
3729-6852-0007 TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARIANNE IN THE COMEDY OF MAREVAUX AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
3729-6852-0008 SHE WAS HONOURABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT SOUERT WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTI CHRISTIAN INTOLERANCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS THE COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOUR OF ALL MANKIND
3729-6852-0009 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF AMELIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SILVIA DIES
3729-6852-0010 I NEVER HAD MANY FAMILY
3729-6852-0011 I HAS A NAME I BELIEVE IN MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
3729-6852-0012 I SHOULD CALL YOU AS SPREE
3729-6852-0013 YOU DO ME THE GREAT HONOUR
3729-6852-0014 YES GO AND GET ME CHANGE FOR A LOUIS I HAVE IT SIR
3729-6852-0015 AT YOUR SERVICE THERE
3729-6852-0016 MADAME QUINSON BESIDES COULD ANSWER YOUR INQUIRIES
3729-6852-0017 I SEE A QUANTITY OF CHAIRS FOR HIRE AT THE RATE OF ONE SOUS MEN READING THE NEWSPAPERS UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES GIRLS AND MEN BREAKFASTING EITHER ALONE OR IN COMPANY WAITERS WHO ARE RAPIDLY GOING UP AND DOWN A NARROW STAIRCASE HIDDEN UNDER THE FOLIAGE
3729-6852-0018 I SIT DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE THE WAITER COMES IMMEDIATELY TO ENQUIRE MY WISHES
3729-6852-0019 I TELL HIM TO GIVE ME SOME COFFEE IF IS GOOD
3729-6852-0020 THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COURT OR THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0021 I THANK HIM AND TO TAKE MY LEAVE
3729-6852-0022 I ADDRESS HIM IN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WITTILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AS I TELL HIM WHY
3729-6852-0023 MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
3729-6852-0024 I SEE A CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN ALREADY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
3729-6852-0025 IS THERE NOT A MERIDIANS EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0026 YES FOR THE MERIDIAN OF THE PALAIS ROYAL IS THE MOST EXACT
3729-6852-0027 THAT IS TRUE BAD ILT GRIE
3729-6852-0028 ALL THESE HONEST PEOPLE ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FILLED
3729-6852-0029 IT IS SOLD EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE CEVETTE CAT
3729-6852-0030 IS IT BETTER THERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
3729-6852-0031 BUT HOW DID SHE MANAGE TO RENDER YOU SO FASHIONABLE
3729-6852-0032 SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HER SNUFF BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG LADY WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HER SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
3729-6852-0033 YOU ARE NOW IN THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR A FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVES THE WELCOME OF INTELLIGENT AND TALENTED PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT FOR SILLINESS IS TRULY A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PEOPLE HERE AND HOWEVER WONDERFUL IT MAY APPEAR SILLINESS IS THE FATHER OF WIT
3729-6852-0034 LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MAD BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THE BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE
3729-6852-0035 IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH APPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ET CETERA IS REALLY A PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM INFALLIBLE
3729-6852-0036 WHEN THE KING GOES TO PARIS EVERYBODY CALLS OUT VIVE LE ROI
3729-6852-0037 SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL MY GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
3729-6852-0038 WHAT SIR I SAY TO HIM AM I FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
3729-6852-0039 HE HIMSELF RECITED THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE SAW THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
3729-6852-0040 FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHICH YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
3729-6852-0041 I FEEL IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
3729-6852-0042 I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INSATIABLE AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULD MEET WITH THE TEACHER I REQUIRED I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY HIM
3729-6852-0043 I RESIDE IN THE MARAIS RUE DES DU SPORT
3729-6852-0044 I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FRENCH AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY MAKING YOU INSATIABLE
3729-6852-0045 HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY REPARTEES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANY ONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED WITH AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
3729-6852-0046 HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERY THING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANY THING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
4077-13751-0000 ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS WAS FORMERLY ORGANIZED AND THIS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
4077-13751-0001 ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF IS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
4077-13751-0002 INSTEAD OF BUT SIXTY REGULARLY AFFILIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TO DAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
4077-13751-0003 IN PLACE OF A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGREGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OF ZION AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WARDS EACH WARD AND STAKE WITH HIS FULL COMPLEMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRIESTHOOD ORGANIZATIONS
4077-13751-0004 THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ITS PROSELYTES INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BUILDING UP AND STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOM MET WITH ABROAD SO ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
4077-13751-0005 NEVERTHELESS THE MUSTARD SEED AMONG THE TALLEST OF ALL SEEDS HAS ATTAINED THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW AN OAK OFFERING PROTECTION AND THE SWEETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY EARNEST PILGRIM JOURNEYING ITS WAY FOR TRUTH
4077-13751-0006 THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SUN NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSELYTING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ASSEMBLED
4077-13751-0007 THE BOOK O MORMON HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TOWARD THIS DARK SKINNED REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMONISM NEARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH THEIR EYES WENT THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
4077-13751-0008 IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THE RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOOK O' MORMON STRICT AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
4077-13751-0009 THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF KURTLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE ERIE AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE IN MODERN TIMES
4077-13751-0010 TO THE FERVENT LATTER DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR A RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATION
4077-13751-0011 SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES OF MISSOURI INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISSOURIANS
4077-13751-0012 THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LILBURN W BOGGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MORMON HATER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFEST HIS SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTORS
4077-13751-0013 THERE SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FITLY CHRONICLED BY HUMAN SCRIBE
4077-13751-0014 MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEES FOUND SHELTER AMONGST THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN CAULDWELL COUNTY THEREIN FOUNDING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
4077-13751-0015 A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON FAMILIES ON SHOAL CREEK AND HERE UPON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPLESS SETTLERS AND BUTCHERED A SCORE
4077-13751-0016 BE IT SAID TO THE HONOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNED ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGN THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
4077-13751-0017 WHY WHAT A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT
4077-13751-0018 AMERICAN SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ABBAGGINZES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH THE PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE VAUDOIS HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF THE ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE
4077-13751-0019 WHO BEGAN THIS QUARREL WAS IT THE MORMONS
4077-13751-0020 AS A SAMPLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST THE BRUTALITY OF THE MISSOURIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE
4077-13751-0021 IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISSOURI WITH GOVERNOR BOGG'S AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INCITED TOO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVES OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE
4077-13754-0000 THE ARMY HAD FOUND THE PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND LEFT THEM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
4077-13754-0001 BUT A WORD FURTHER CONCERNING THAT EXPEDITION IN GENERAL
4077-13754-0002 IT WAS THROUGH FLOYD'S ADVICE THAT BUCHANAN ORDERED THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH OSTENSIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN ALLEGED INFANTILE REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD EVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THE SECESSIONISTS
4077-13754-0003 MOREOVER HAD THEIR PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHAT GREATER OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISHED
4077-13754-0004 ALREADY THE NORTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF WHY NOT SET UP ALSO A WEST
4077-13754-0005 THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH NO EAST NO WEST THEY STOOD POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THAT AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN IN ARMS FOR THEIR COUNTRY'S NEED
4077-13754-0006 WHAT THE LATTER DAY SAINTS CALL CELESTIAL MARRIAGE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTICE BUT IN CELESTIAL MARRIAGE PLURALITY OF WIVES WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
4077-13754-0007 WE BELIEVE IN A LITERAL RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATE SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SANCTIFIED AND AUTHORIZED RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER COUSIN AND WIFE
4077-13754-0008 IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE AND I HAVE YET TO FIND THE PLACES AND MEET THE PEOPLE WHERE AND WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE MALIGNED MORMONS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST
4077-13754-0009 WITH THE INCEPTION OF PLURAL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTICE
4077-13754-0010 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS ENACTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING PLURAL MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRIOR TO HIS PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER
4077-13754-0011 FEDERAL JUDGES AND UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS IN UTAH WHO WERE NOT MORMONS NOR LOVERS OF MORMONISM REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN COMPLAINTS OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF HIS MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND INADEQUACY
4077-13754-0012 THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISDEMEANOUR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE AYE FOR MANY TIMES OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURT'S POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTEND SO FAR AND MIGHT BE FINED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
4077-13754-0013 BEFORE THIS TRAVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THEY MET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT DESERVED MEN WERE IMPRISONED UNDER SENTENCE OF MANY YEARS DURATION
4077-13754-0014 THE PEOPLE PROTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE
4077-13754-0015 THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND INITIATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL ESTATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL IN ITS OWN PROPERTY
4077-13754-0016 AND SO THE STORY OF MORMONISM RUNS ON HIS FINALE HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE CURRENT PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF ITS PLAN
4446-2271-0000 MAINEHALL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0001 HE HAD PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICAS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS OR MECHANICS
4446-2271-0002 AND IT'S TREMENDOUSLY WELL PUT ON TOO
4446-2271-0003 IT'S BEEN ON NEARLY TWO WEEKS AND I'VE BEEN HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY
4446-2271-0004 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MEEHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
4446-2271-0005 SHE SAVES HER PEN TOO SHE'S AT HER BEST IN THE SECOND ACT
4446-2271-0006 HE'S BEEN WANTIN TO MARRY HILDA THESE THREE YEARS AND MORE
4446-2271-0007 SHE DOESN'T MAKE UP WITH ANYBODY YOU KNOW
4446-2271-0008 IRENE BURGOYNE ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS THE ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
4446-2271-0009 MAINHALL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE THE KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
4446-2271-0010 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HERE LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
4446-2271-0011 SIR HARRY TOWNS MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0012 I SAY SIR HENRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TONIGHT ISN'T SHE
4446-2271-0013 YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE A BIT CONSCIOUS TO MORROW FOR THE FIRST TIME
4446-2271-0014 WESTMERE AND I WAS BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
4446-2271-0015 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES SIMPLY
4446-2271-0016 HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A KEEN INTEREST IN THAT SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD
4446-2271-0017 ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WINIFRED WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD HER THAT THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
4446-2271-0018 SHE CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT THOUGH I AM GLAD YOU TOLD ME
4446-2271-0019 AFTER THIS IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO FORGET
4446-2271-0020 OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY AND SENSIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY WILD AND DAFTY
4446-2271-0021 SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THE THEATRE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE OUGHT TO
4446-2271-0022 I'M GLAD SHE'S GOT HER OWN SENSE
4446-2271-0023 AND AFTER ALL WE WERE AWFULLY YOUNG
4446-2271-0024 I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF I COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT WITH ME NOW
4446-2273-0000 HILDA WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT UPON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HIS CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVOUSLY OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR
4446-2273-0001 THEY ASKED HIM TO COME TO SEE EM IN CHELSEA AND THEY SPOKE VERY TENDERLY OF HILDA
4446-2273-0002 LAMB WOULDN'T CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MANY OF HIM I FANCY
4446-2273-0003 WHEN BARTLEY ARRIVED AT BEDFORD SQUARE ON SUNDAY EVENING MARIA THE PRETTY LITTLE FRENCH GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR AND CONDUCTED HIM UPSTAIRS
4446-2273-0004 I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF MOLLY HAS BEEN HERE FOR I REMEMBER YOU DON'T LIKE ENGLISH COOKERY
4446-2273-0005 I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE YET TO TELL YOU WHAT A JOLLY LITTLE PALACE I THINK THIS IS
4446-2273-0006 THEY ARE ALL SKETCHES MADE ABOUT THE VILLADEESTE YOU SEE
4446-2273-0007 THOSE FELLOWS ARE ALL VERY LOYAL EVEN MAIN HULL
4446-2273-0008 I'VE MANAGED TO SAVE SOMETHING EVERY YEAR AND THAT WITH HELPING MY THREE SISTERS NOW AND THEN AND TIDYING POOR COUSIN MIKE OUT BAD SEASONS
4446-2273-0009 IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY RARE SHE SAID BUT SOME OF THAT WAS MY MOTHER'S
4446-2273-0010 THERE WAS WATERCRESS SOUP AND SOLE AND A DELIGHTFUL OMELETTE STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS AND TRUFFLES AND TWO SMALL RARE DUCKLINGS AND ARTICHOKES AND A DRY YELLOW ROIN WINE OF WHICH BARTLEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND
4446-2273-0011 THERE'S NOTHING ELSE IT LOOKS SO JOLLY
4446-2273-0012 THANK YOU BUT DON'T LIKE IT SO WELL AS THIS
4446-2273-0013 HAVE YOU BEEN IN PARIS MUCH THESE EARLY YEARS
4446-2273-0014 THERE A FEW CHANGES IN THE OLD QUARTER
4446-2273-0015 DON'T I THOUGH I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR IT HOW DID YOUR MOTHER TURN OUT
4446-2273-0016 HER HAIR IS STILL LIKE FLAX AND HER BLUE EYES ARE JUST LIKE A BABY'S AND SHE HAS THE SAME THREE FRECKLES ON HER LITTLE NOSE AND TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO HER BAN DE MERS
4446-2273-0017 HOW JOLLY IT WAS BEING YOUNG HILDAS
4446-2273-0018 DO YOU REMEMBER THAT FIRST WALK WE TOOK TOGETHER ON PARIS
4446-2273-0019 COME WE'LL HAVE OUR COFFEE IN THE OTHER ROOM AND YOU CAN SLEEP
4446-2273-0020 I THINK WE DID HE ANSWERED DEMURELY
4446-2273-0021 WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US IS NEITHER OUR FLOWERS NOR OUR FRANCS BUT JUST OUR YOUTH
4446-2273-0022 THEY ARE BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE
4446-2273-0023 THE STRANGE WOMAN AND HER PASSIONATE SILENCE THAT RANG OUT SO SHARPLY HAD FRIGHTENED THEM BOTH
4446-2273-0024 BARTLEY STARTED WHEN HILDA RANG THE LITTLE BELL BESIDE HER DEAR ME WHY DID YOU DO THIS
4446-2273-0025 IT WAS VERY JOLLY HE MURMURED LAZILY AS MARIE CAME IN TO TAKE AWAY HIS COFFEE
4446-2273-0026 HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY NEW PAY
4446-2273-0027 WHEN SHE FINISHED ALEXANDER SHOOK HIMSELF OUT OF REVERIES
4446-2273-0028 NONSENSE OF COURSE I CAN'T REALLY SING HERE THE WAY MY MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER DID BEFORE ME
4446-2273-0029 IT'S REALLY TOO WARM IN THIS ROOM TO SING DON'T YOU THINK IT
4446-2273-0030 ALEXANDER WENT ON AND OPENED THE WINDOW FOR HER
4446-2273-0031 YOU JUST IN FRONT
4446-2273-0032 HE STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND HER AND TRIED TO STEADY HIMSELF AS HE SAID IT'S SOFT AND MISTY SEE HOW WHITE THOSE STARS ARE
4446-2273-0033 FOR A LONGER TIME NEITHER HILDA NOR BARTLEY SPOKE
4446-2273-0034 HE FELT A TREMOR RUN OVER THE SLENDER YELLOW FIGURE IN FRONT OF HIM
4446-2273-0035 BARTLEY LEANED OVER HER SHOULDER WITHOUT TOUCHING HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR YOU ARE GIVING ME A CHANCE HERE
4446-2273-0036 ALEXANDER CLENCHED THE TWO HANDS IN HIS SIDES
4446-2275-0000 THE STOP AT QUEENSTOWN THE TEDIOUS PASSAGE UP THE MERCY WERE THINGS THAT HE NOTED DIMLY TO HIS GROWING IMPATIENCE
4446-2275-0001 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UP STAIRS
4446-2275-0002 ALEXANDER PACED UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAY BUTTONING AND UNBUTTONING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO TILDA'S LIVING ROOM
4446-2275-0003 THE ROAD WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
4446-2275-0004 BUT ALEXANDER DID NOT SIT DOWN
4446-2275-0005 I FELT IT IN MY BONE WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING THAT SOMETHING SPLENDID WAS GOING TO TURN UP
4446-2275-0006 I THOUGHT IT MAY BE SISTER KATE OR COUSIN MIKE WOULD BE HAPPENING ALONG
4446-2275-0007 SHE PUSHED HIM TOWARD THAT BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEARTH HER KNEES DRAWN UP TO HER CHIN LAUGHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL
4446-2275-0008 HOW DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
4446-2275-0009 WE GOT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO
4446-2275-0010 ALEXANDER LEANED FORWARD AND WARMED HIS EYES BEFORE THE BLAZE
4446-2275-0011 BARTIE BENT LOWERED OVER THE FIRE
4446-2275-0012 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THROWN FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
4446-2275-0013 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISHED ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
4446-2275-0014 I CAN'T STAND HEARING YOU MISERABLE
4446-2275-0015 HE THREW UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
4446-2275-0016 HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM THE CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES AN
4446-2275-0017 OR IT'S WORSE NOW IT'S UNBEARABLE
4446-2275-0018 I GET NOTHING BUT MISERABLE OUT OF EITHER
4446-2275-0019 THE WORLD IS ALL THERE JUST AS IT USED TO BE BUT I CAN'T GET AT ANY MORE
4446-2275-0020 IT WAS MYSELF I WAS DEPYING HILDA
4446-2275-0021 HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN
4446-2275-0022 BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU WERE HERE IN THE SUMMER
4446-2275-0023 ALEXANDER GROANED I MEANT TO BUT ANYHOW I COULDN'T
4446-2275-0024 SHE PRESSED HIS HAND AGAIN IN GRATITUDE
4446-2275-0025 WEREN'T WE HAPPY THEN AT ALL
4446-2275-0026 SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH AS IF TO DROP IN AGAIN THE FRAGRANCE OF THOSE DAYS
4446-2275-0027 HE MOVED UNEASILY ON HIS CHAIR CREAKED
4446-2275-0028 YES YES SHE SIGHED PULLING HER HAND GENTLY AWAY FROM HIM
4446-2275-0029 PLEASE TELL ME ONE THING BARTLET AT LEAST TELL ME THAT YOU BELIEVE I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING YOU HAPPY
4446-2275-0030 YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SHARPLY
4446-2275-0031 I UNDERSTAND PARTLEY I WAS WRONG
4446-2275-0032 BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU'VE ONLY TO TELL ME NOW
4446-2275-0033 WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I WANT YOU TO PROMISE NEVER TO SEE ME AGAIN NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I COME NO MATTER HOW HARD I PROMISE
4446-2275-0034 KEEP AWAY IF YOU WISH WHEN HAVE I EVER FAILED YOU
4446-2275-0035 ALEXANDER ROSE AND SHOOK HIMSELF EAGERLY YES I KNOW I'M COWARDLY
4446-2275-0036 HE TOOK HER ROUGHLY IN HIS ARMS DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
4446-2275-0037 OR BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
4446-2275-0038 I WILL ASK THE GREATEST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
4446-2275-0039 HE MUST KNOW ABOUT YOU
4446-2275-0040 THE SIGHT OF YOU MARTLEY TO SEE YOU LIVING AND HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL CAN I NEVER MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME
4446-2275-0041 YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVED YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
4446-2275-0042 AND THEN YOU WENT BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
4446-2275-0043 BARTLEY WENT OVER AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS KISSING HER MOUTH AND HER WET TIRED EYES
4446-2275-0044 O DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
4446-2275-0045 YOU'VE TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TO NIGHT
4507-16021-0000 CHAPTERS ONE ORIGIN
4507-16021-0001 IT ENGENDERS A WHOLE WORLD LA PEGRE FOR WHICH RED THEFT AND A HELL LA PEGREEN FOR WHICH RED HUNGER
4507-16021-0002 SUCH IDLENESS IS THE MOTHER
4507-16021-0003 SHE HAS A SON AFT AND A DAUGHTER HUNGER
4507-16021-0004 WHAT IS SLAGG
4507-16021-0005 WE HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THIS SORT OF AFFECTIONS
4507-16021-0006 HER SLANG IS ODIOUS
4507-16021-0007 SLANG MAKES ONE DREAD
4507-16021-0008 WHO DENIES THAT OF COURSE IT DO
4507-16021-0009 WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF PROBING A WOUND A GULF A SOCIETY SINCE WHEN HAS IT BEEN CONSIDERED WRONG TO GO TOO FAR AND GO TO THE BOTTOM
4507-16021-0010 WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST A SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH DUTY RECEIVED IN FULFILLED MERITS
4507-16021-0011 WHY SHOULD ONE NOT EXPLORE EVERYBODY AND STUDY EVERYTHING
4507-16021-0012 WHY COULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY
4507-16021-0013 NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS OF ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWARMING OF SLANG
4507-16021-0014 NOW WHEN HAS HORROR EVER EXCLUDED BLOOD
4507-16021-0015 SINCE WHEN HAS MALADY BANISHED MEDICAL
4507-16021-0016 CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIPER THE BAT THE SCORPION A CENTIPEDE THE TARANTULA AND ONE WHO WOULD CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT IS
4507-16021-0017 IT WOULD BE LIKE A PHILOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PHILOSOPHER HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
4507-16021-0018 WHAT IS SLANG PROPERLY KEEPING
4507-16021-0019 IT IS THE LANGUAGE OF WRETCHEDNESS AND
4507-16021-0020 WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ATTENUATING IT WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALL TRADES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ALLOWED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND ALL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE THEIR OWN SLANG
4507-16021-0021 THE PAINTER WHO SAYS MY GRINDER THE NOTARY WHO SAYS MY SKIP THE GUTTER THE HAIRDRESSER WHO SAYS MY MEALY BAG THE COBBLER WHO SAYS MY CUB TALKS SLANG
4507-16021-0022 THERE IS THE SLANG OF THE AFFECTED PARTY AS WELL AS OF THE PRECIUSES
4507-16021-0023 THE SUGAR MANUFACTURER WHO SAYS LEAF CLARIFIED LUMPS BASTARD COMMON BURNT THIS HONEST MANUFACTURER TALKS SLANG
4507-16021-0024 ALGEBRA MEDICINE BOTANY HAVE EACH SLANG
4507-16021-0025 TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS CONFLICT WRETCHEDNESS HAS INVENTED A LANGUAGE IN COMBAT WHICH IS SLANG
4507-16021-0026 TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MAN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF WHICH CIVIL IS COMPOSED OR BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO EXTEND THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION IS TO SERVE CIVILIZATION ITSELF
4507-16021-0027 PHOENICIUS VERY GOOD
4507-16021-0028 NOT EVEN DIALECT LET THAT PASS
4507-16021-0029 THIS WE REPLY IN ONE WORD ONLY
4507-16021-0030 ASSUREDLY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERIE IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND STUDY
4507-16021-0031 AND NOW WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH A VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICE IS PERMITTED
4507-16021-0032 HE MUST DESCEND WITH HIS HEART FULL OF CHARITY AND SEVERITY AT THE SAME TIME AS A BROTHER AND AS A JUDGE TO THOSE IMPENETRABLE CASEMATES WHERE CRYING PELL MELL THOSE WHO BLEED AND THOSE WHO DEAL THE BLOW THOSE WHO WEEP AND THOSE WHO CURSE THOSE WHO FAST AND THOSE WHO DEVOUR THOSE WHO ENDURE EVIL AND THOSE WHO INFLICT IT
4507-16021-0033 DID WE REALLY KNOW THE MOUNTAIN WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CAVERN
4507-16021-0034 THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS INTERLACED AND WHICH ALSO BRING FORTH RESULTS
4507-16021-0035 TRUE HISTORY BEING A MIXTURE OF ALL THINGS THE TRUTH HISTORIAN MINGLES IN EVERYTHING
4507-16021-0036 FACTS FORM ONE OF THESE AND IDEAS THE THREE
4507-16021-0037 THERE IT CLOTHS ITSELF IN WORD MASKS IN METAPHOR RAGS
4507-16021-0038 IN THIS GUISE IT BECOMES HABITUAL
4507-16021-0039 ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR SOUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN THE ARTICULATE WORD
4507-16021-0040 ONE THINKS ONE HEARS HYDRAAS TALKING
4507-16021-0041 IT IS UNINTELLIGIBLE TO THE DARK
4507-16021-0042 IT IS BLACKER IN MISFORTUNE IT IS BLACKER STILL IN CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED COMPOSE SLANG
4507-16021-0043 THE EARTH IS NOT DEVOID OF RESEMBLANCE TO A BAIL
4507-16021-0044 TO LOOK CLOSELY AT LIFE
4507-16021-0045 IT IS SO MADE THAT EVERYBODY WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT
4507-16021-0046 EACH DAY HAS ITS OWN GREAT GRIEF FOR ITS LITTLE CAUSE
4507-16021-0047 YESTERDAY YOU WERE TREMBLING FOR A HEALTH THAT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR OWN TO MORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE DIATRIBE OF A SLANDERER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THEN THE QUARRELING WEATHER THEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN OR LOST THEM A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE AND YOUR VERTEBRAL COLUMN REPROACH YOU AGAIN THE COURSE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
4507-16021-0048 THIS WITHOUT RECKONING TO THE PAINS OF THE HEART AND SO IT GOES ON
4507-16021-0049 THERE IS HARDLY ONE NIGHT OUT OF A HUNDRED WHICH IS WHOLLY JOYOUS AND SUNNY
4507-16021-0050 AND YOU BELONG TO THAT SMALL CLASS WHICH ARE HAPPY
4507-16021-0051 IN THIS WORLD'S EVIDENTLY THE VESTIBULE OF ANOTHER THERE ARE NO WORTHY
4507-16021-0052 THE REAL HUMAN DIVISION IS THESE THE LUMINOUS AND THE SHADY
4507-16021-0053 TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF THE SHADY AND AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF THE LUMINOUS THAT IS THE OBJECT
4507-16021-0054 THAT IS WHY WE REQUIRE EDUCATION SCIENCE
4507-16021-0055 TO TEACH REASON MEANS TO LIGHT THE FIRE EVERY SYLLABLE SPELT OUT SPARKLES
4507-16021-0056 HOWEVER HE WHO SAYS LIGHT DOES NOT NECESSARILY KNOW JOY
4507-16021-0057 THE PEOPLE SUFFER IN THE LIGHT EXCESS BURNS
4507-16021-0058 THE FLAME IS THE ENVY OF THE WING
4507-16021-0059 TO BURN WITHOUT CEASING TO FLY THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF PATIENCE
4970-29093-0000 YOU'LL NEVER DRINK IT OUT OF THE ASTOR LIBRARY
4970-29093-0001 TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN HERE AND ELSEWHERE THE PATHS TO FORTUNE ARE INNUMERABLE AND ALL OPEN THERE IS INVITATION IN THE AIR AND SUCCESS IN ALL HIS WIDE HORIZON
4970-29093-0002 HE HAS NO TRADITIONS TO BIND HIM OR GUIDE HIM BUT HIS IMPULSE IS TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE OCCUPATION HIS FATHER HAS FOLLOWED AND MAKE A NEW WAY FOR HIMSELF
4970-29093-0003 THE MODEST FELLOW WOULD HAVE LIKED FAME THRUST UPON HIM FOR SOME WORTHY ACHIEVEMENT IT MIGHT BE FOR A BOOK OR FOR THE SKILLFUL MANAGEMENT OF SOME GREAT NEWSPAPER OR FOR SOME DARING EXPEDITION LIKE THAT OF LIEUTENANT STRAYIN OR DOCTOR KANE
4970-29093-0004 HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHEN IT SHOULD BE
4970-29093-0005 SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A CONSPICUOUS PULPIT AND HUMBLY PREACH THE GOSPEL OF REPENTANCE AND IT EVEN CROSSED HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISSIONARY LIFE TO SOME BENIGHTED REGION WHERE THE DATE PALM GROWS AND THE NIGHTINGALE'S VOICE IS IN TUNE AND THE BULBUL SINGS ON THE SOPHNITES
4970-29093-0006 LAW SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SCIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENTS WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK IN THE ANTEROOM OF THE LAW OFFICE WHERE HE WAS WRITING PHILIP INVARIABLY ADVISED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE GREATLY TO THE DISGUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTICE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN COULD ONLY BE ATTAINED BY THE RECOGNISED PROCESSES WITH THEIR ATTENDANT FEES
4970-29093-0007 IT IS SUCH A NATURAL AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
4970-29093-0008 HE WANTED TO BEGIN AGAIN AT THE TOP OF THE LADDER
4970-29093-0009 PHILIP THEREFORE READ DILIGENTLY IN THE ASTOR LIBRARY PLANNED LIBRARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPEL ATTENTION AND NURSED HIS GENIUS
4970-29093-0010 HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO STEP INTO THE DORKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON A PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY GRAPEVINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT
4970-29093-0011 OH VERY WELL SAID GRINGO TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU LL FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT
4970-29093-0012 BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THANKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THEIR POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL
4970-29093-0013 AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS BOOKS AND TO HIS READING FOR AN OPENING LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIS DIGNIFIED ENTRANCE INTO THE LITERARY WORLD
4970-29093-0014 BUT I'M GOING AS AN ENGINEER YOU COULD GO AS ONE
4970-29093-0015 YOU CAN BEGIN BY RAISING A ROD AND PUTTING DOWN THE FIGURES
4970-29093-0016 OH IT'S NOT TOO SOON
4970-29093-0017 I'VE BEEN READY TO GO NOWHERE FOR SIX MONTHS
4970-29093-0018 THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BY THIS TIME FULL OF THE ADVENTURE WENT DOWN TO THE WALL STREET OFFICE OF MARY'S UNCLE AND HAD A TALK WITH THAT WILY OPERATOR
4970-29093-0019 THE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN PACKING UP AND WRITING LETTERS FOR PHILIP WOULD NOT TAKE AN IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT INFORMING HIS FRIENDS
4970-29093-0020 WHY IT'S IN MISSOURI SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER I THINK WE'LL TAKE A MAP
4970-29093-0021 I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEARER HOUSE
4970-29093-0022 HE KNEW HIS UNCLE TO BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE HAD AT LAST TURNED HIS THOUGHTS TO A PRACTICAL MATTER
4970-29093-0023 HE WELL KNEW THE PERILS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE CHANGES OF FEVER
4970-29095-0000 AND SHE WAS TIRED OF OTHER THINGS
4970-29095-0001 SHE CARRIED THIS MORNING AN AIR OR TWO UPON THE PIANO SANG A SIMPLE SONG IN A SWEET BUT SLIGHTLY METALLIC VOICE AND THEN SEATING HERSELF BY THE OPEN WINDOW READ PHILIP'S LETTER
4970-29095-0002 WELL MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT LOOKING UP WITH A SHADE OF IMPATIENCE
4970-29095-0003 I HOPE THEE TOLD THE ELDERS THAT FATHER AND I ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIANO AND THAT MUCH AS THEE LOVES MUSIC THEE IS NEVER IN A ROOM WHEN IT IS PLAYED
4970-29095-0004 I HEARD FATHER TELL COUSIN ABNER THAT HE WAS WHIPPED SO OFTEN FOR WHISTLING WHEN HE WAS A BOY THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE WHAT COMPENSATION HE COULD GET THERE
4970-29095-0005 MY WAYS GREATLY TRY ME RUTH AND ALL THY RELATIONS
4970-29095-0006 WAS THY FATHER WILLING THEE SHOULD GO AWAY TO A SCHOOL OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE
4970-29095-0007 I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THESE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS
4970-29095-0008 MOTHER I' AM GOING TO STUDY MEDICINE
4970-29095-0009 MARGARET BOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT THE HABITUAL PLACIDITY
4970-29095-0010 AND THEE STUDY MEDICINE
4970-29095-0011 DOES THEE THINK THEE COULD STAND THIS SIX MONTHS
4970-29095-0012 AND BESIDES SUPPOSE THEE DOES WANT MEDICINE
4970-29095-0013 I WILL STRIKE IT
4970-29095-0014 WHY THEE AND THY FAMILY ARE KNOWN
4970-29095-0015 AND IF I CAN GET PATIENCE
4970-29095-0016 RUTH SAT QUITE STILL FOR A TIME WITH FACE INTENT AND FLUSHED IT WAS ON NOW
4970-29095-0017 THE SIGHTSEERS RETURNED IN HIGH SPIRITS FROM THIS CITY
4970-29095-0018 RUTH ASKED THE ENTHUSIASTS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE ON SUCH A SOUNDING MAUSOLEUM WITH ITS GREAT HALLS AND ECHOING ROOMS AND NO COMFORTABLE PLACE IN IT FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF ANY BODY
4970-29095-0019 AND THEN THERE WAS BROAD DAY
4970-29095-0020 THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO END TO IT AND EVEN RUTH WAS PHILADELPHIAN ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT A STREET OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARCHITECTURAL POINT UPON WHICH THE WEARY EYE COULD REST
4970-29095-0021 BUT NEITHER SAINT GERARD NOR BROAD STREET NEITHER WONDERS OF THE MINT NOR THE GLORIES OF THE HALL WHERE THE GHOSTS OF OUR FATHERS SIT ALWAYS SIGNING THE DECLARATION IMPRESSED THE VISITORS SO MUCH AS THE SPLENDORS OF THE CHESTNUT STREET WINDOWS AND THE DRAGONS ON EIGHTH STREET
4970-29095-0022 IS THEE GOING TO THE YEARLY MEETING RUTH ANSWERED ONE OF THE GIRLS
4970-29095-0023 I HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR REPLIED THAT DEMURE BOY
4970-29095-0024 IT HAS OCCUPIED MOTHER A LONG TIME TO FIND AT THE SHOPS THE EXACT SHADE FOR A NEW BONNET
4970-29095-0025 THEN THEE WON'T GO WHY SHOULD I
4970-29095-0026 IF I GO TO MEETING AT ALL I LIKE BEST TO SIT IN THE QUIET OLD HOUSE IN GERMANTOWN WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE ALL OPEN AND I COULD SEE THE TREES AND HEAR THE STIR OF THE LEAVES
4970-29095-0027 IT'S SUCH A CRUSH AT THE YEARLY MEETING AT ARCH STREET AND THEN THERE'S A ROW OF SLEEK LOOKING YOUNG MEN WHO LINED THE CURBSTONE AND STARE AT US AS WE COME OUT
4970-29095-0028 HE DOESN'T SAY BUT IT'S ON THE FRONTIER AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESSERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLATE AS A WEDNESDAY MEETING IT WAS TIME FOR THEM TO DO SOMETHING
4970-29095-0029 IS HE GOING TO START A DAILY NEWSPAPER AMONG THE COOKAPOOS
4970-29095-0030 FATHER THEE'S UNJUST TO FIX UP HE'S GOING INTO BUSINESS
4970-29095-0031 SHE DOESN'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SAID RUTH A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT LAND AND RAILROADS AND THEE KNOWS FATHER THAT FORTUNES ARE MADE NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW IN A NEW COUNTRY
4970-29095-0032 BUT PHILIP IS HONEST AND HE HAS TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRIBBLING TO MAKE HIS WAYS
4970-29095-0033 WHAT A BOX WOMEN ARE PUT TO MEASURED FOR IT AND PUT IN YOUNG IF WE GO ANYWHERE IT'S IN A BOX VEILED AND PINIONED AND SHUT IN BY DISABILITIES
4970-29095-0034 WHY SHOULD I RAST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN INACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL
4970-29095-0035 AND IF I HAD MY FORTUNE WOULD THEE WANT ME TO LEAD A USELESS LIFE
4970-29095-0036 HAS THEE CONSULTED THY MOTHER ABOUT THE CAREER I SUPPOSE IT IS A CAREER OF THEE WANTS
4970-29095-0037 BUT THAT WISE AND PLACID WOMAN UNDERSTOOD THE SWEET REBELS A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN RUTH UNDERSTOOD HERSELF
4970-29095-0038 RUTH WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT PHILIP HAD MADE A PUSH INTO THE WORLD AND SHE WAS SURE THAT THIS TALENT AND COURAGE WOULD MAKE A WAY FOR HIM
4992-23283-0000 BUT THE MORE FORGETFULNESS HAD THEN PREVAILED THE MORE POWERFUL WAS THE VOICE OF REMEMBRANCE WHEN SHE AWOKE
4992-23283-0001 MISS MILOR'S HEALTH IS NOT GOOD
4992-23283-0002 SAID MISSUS HORTON A FEW MONTHS AFTER
4992-23283-0003 SO THAT IS TO ME ADDED SAMFORD WITH A SARCASTIC SNEER
4992-23283-0004 AND YET YOU MUST OWN HER BEHAVIOR HAS WARRANTED THEN HAS IT NOT BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR INCOHERENT AND UNACCOUNTABLE
4992-23283-0005 NOT THAT I KNOW OF NOT ONE MORE THAT I KNOW OF HE REPLIED WITH ASTONISHMENT AT WHAT SHE HAD INSINUATED YET WITH A PERFECT ASSURANCE THAT SHE WAS IN THE WRONG
4992-23283-0006 PERHAPS I AM MISTAKEN RETURNED SHE
4992-23283-0007 TO ASK ANYMORE QUESTIONS OF YOU I BELIEVE WOULD BE UNFAIR
4992-23283-0008 HE SEEMED TO WAIT FOR HER REPLY FOR AS SHE MADE NONE HE PROCEEDED
4992-23283-0009 NO MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY WITH A MOST FORCIBLE ACCENT YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH SHE WOULD PARDON ME FOR INTRUSTING
4992-23283-0010 BUT IN SUCH A CASE MISS MILNER'S ELECTION OF A HUSBAND SHALL NOT DIRECT
4992-23283-0011 IF SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO ESTIMATE HER OWN VALUE I GO
4992-23283-0012 INDEPENDENT OF HER FORTUNES SHE HAS BEAUTY TO CAPTIVATE THE HEART OF ANY MAN AND WITH ALL HER FOLLIES SHE HAS A FRANKNESS IN HER MANNER AN UNAFFECTED WISDOM IN HER THOUGHTS A VIVACITY IN HER CONVERSATION AND WITHAL A SOFTNESS IN HER DEMEANOR THAT MAY ALONE ENGAGE THE AFFECTIONS OF A MAN OF THE NICEST SENTIMENTS AND THE STRONGEST UNDERSTANDING
4992-23283-0013 MY LORD MISS MILNER'S TASTE IS NOT A DEPRAVED ONE IT IS BUT RATHER REFINED
4992-23283-0014 WHAT MAY YOU MEAN BY THAT MISS WOODLEY YOU TALK MYSTERIOUSLY
4992-23283-0015 IS SHE NOT AFRAID THAT I WILL THWART HIS INCLINATIONS
4992-23283-0016 AND AGAIN HE SEARCHED HIS OWN THOUGHTS NOR INEFFECTUALLY AS BEFORE
4992-23283-0017 MISS WOODLEY WAS TOO LITTLE VERSED IN THE SUBJECT TO KNOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT TO LOVE AT ALL AT LEAST NOT TO THE EXTENT OF BREAKING THROUGH ENGAGEMENTS IN ALL THE VARIOUS OBSTACLES THAT STILL MITIGATED AGAINST THEIR UNION
4992-23283-0018 TO RELIEVE THEM FROM BOTH HE LAID HIS HAND WITH FORCE UPON HIS HEART AND SAID DO YOU BELIEVE ME
4992-23283-0019 I WILL MAKE NO UNJUST USE OF WHAT I KNOW HE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS I BELIEVE MY LORD
4992-23283-0020 I HAVE NEVER YET HOWEVER BEEN VANQUISHED BY THEM AND EVEN UPON THIS OCCASION MY REASON SHALL COMBAT THEM TO THE LAST AND MY REASON SHALL FAIL ME BEFORE I DID WRONG
4992-41797-0000 YESS DEAD THESE FOUR YEARS AND A GOOD JOB FOR HER TOO
4992-41797-0001 WELL AS I SAY IT'S AN AWFUL QUEER WORLD THEY CLAP ALL THE BURGLARS IN JAIL AND THE MURDERERS AND THE WIFE BEATERS I ALLERS THOUGHT A GENTLE REPROOF WOULD BE ENOUGH PUNISHMENT FOR A WIFE BEATER COS HE PROB'LY HAS A LOT OF PROVOCATION THAT NOBODY KNOWS AND THE FIRE BUGS CAN'T THINK O THE RIGHT NAMES SOMETHIN LIKE SENDIARIES AND THE BREAKERS OF THE PEACE AND WHAT NOT AND YET THE LAW HAS NOTHING TO SAY TO A MAN LIKE HEN LORD
4992-41797-0002 GRANDFATHER WAS ALEXANDER CAREY L L D DOCTOR OF LAW THAT IS
4992-41797-0003 MISTER POPHAM LAID DOWN THIS BRUSH
4992-41797-0004 I SWAIN TO MAN HE EJACULATED IF YOU DON'T WORK HARD YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES DOCTORS OF LAWS

4992-41797-0006 HE KEEPS THE THOU SHALT NOT COMMANDMENT FIRST RATE HEN LORD DOES
4992-41797-0007 HE GAVE UP HIS POSITION AND SHUT THE FAMILY UP IN THIS TOMB OF A HOUSE SO'N HE COULD STUDY HIS BOOKS
4992-41797-0008 MISTER POPHAM EXAGGERATED NOTHING BUT ON THE CONTRARY LEFT MUCH UNSAID IN HIS NARRATIVE OF THE FAMILY AT THAT HOUSE OF LORDS
4992-41797-0009 HENRY LORD WITH THE DEGREE OF P R D TO HIS CREDIT HAD BEEN PROFESSOR OF ZOOLOGY AT A NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE BUT HAD RESIGNED HIS POST IN ORDER TO WRITE A SERIES OF SCIENTIFIC TEXT BOOKS
4992-41797-0010 ALWAYS IRRITABLE COLD INDIGNANT HE HAD GROWN RAPIDLY MORE SO AS YEARS WENT ON
4992-41797-0011 WHENEVER APPEALED TO HER SENSE OF BEAUTY WAS STRAIGHTWAY TRANSFERRED TO PAPER OR CANVAS
4992-41797-0012 SHE IS WILD YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THINGS
4992-41797-0013 SHE MAKES EFFORT AFTER EFFORT TREMBLING WITH EAGERNESS AND WHEN SHE FAILS TO REPRODUCE WHAT SHE SEES SHE WORKS HERSELF INTO A FRENZY OF GRIEF AND DISAPPOINT
4992-41797-0014 WHEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE THE RABBIT OR A BIRD LOOK REAL ON PAPER SHE SEARCHED IN HER FATHER'S BOOKS FOR PICTURES OF ITS BONES
4992-41797-0015 SAMUEL THERE MUST BE SOME BETTER WAY OF DOING I JUST DRAW THE OUTLINE OF AN ANIMAL AND THEN I PUT HAIRS OR FEATHERS ON IT THEY HAVE NO BODIES
4992-41797-0016 I COULDN'T RUN OR MOVE THEY'RE JUST PASTEBOARD

5105-28233-0003 WE DON'T SPIN TOPS IS A FAVOURITE SAYING AMONG THE ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVADAC BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS

5105-28233-0007 BEN ZOOF'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVADAC'S EARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH ARRONDISSEMENT OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMACHE WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
5105-28233-0008 WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY FOR CAPTAIN SERVADAC
5105-28233-0009 THE BOND OF UNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BEN ZOOF'S ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONOURS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICERS
5105-28233-0010 UNLIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER AND HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANECDOTES AND TROOPERS TALES HE WAS MATCHLESS
5105-28240-0000 FAST AS HIS LEG COULD CARRY HIM SERVADAC HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
5105-28240-0001 IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE AND THE EARTH'S CONVEXITY AND THE CONSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THE RANGE OF VISION THE RIGGING OF THE TOPMASTS ALONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER
5105-28240-0002 EXCLAIMED SERVADAC KEEPING HIS EYE UNMOVED AT ITS TELESCOPE
5105-28240-0003 SHE IS UNDER SAIL BUT SHE IS COUNT TOOMASCHEFF'S YACHT HE WAS RIGHT
5105-28240-0004 IF THE COUNT WERE ON BOARD A STRANGE FATALITY WAS BRINGING HIM TO THE PRESENCE OF A RIVAL
5105-28240-0005 HE RECKONED THEREFORE NOT ONLY UPON ASCERTAINING THE EXTENT OF THEIR LATE CATASTROPHE BUT UPON LEARNING ITS CAUSE
5105-28240-0006 THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOBRYNA COULD NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
5105-28240-0007 SERVADAC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE DOBRINO WAS ENDEAVORING TO PUT IN
5105-28240-0008 A NARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE RIDGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE ROUGHEST WEATHER WOULD INSURE THE CALMNESS OF THE WATERS
5105-28240-0009 SCARCELY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK HER MAINSAIL AND IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HELMSMAN SOON CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOPSAILS BRIGANTINE AND JIB
5105-28240-0010 CAPTAIN SERVADAC HASTENED TOWARDS HER
5105-28240-0011 I LEFT YOU ON A CONTINENT AND HERE I HAVE THE HONOR OF FINDING YOU ON THE ISLAND
5105-28240-0012 NEVER MIND NOW INTERPOSED THE DOCTOR WE WILL TALK OF THAT BY AND BY
5105-28240-0013 NOTHING MORE THAN YOU SEE YOURSELF
5105-28240-0014 ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THIS MEDITERRANEAN
5105-28240-0015 FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SEEMED PERFECTLY STUPEFIED AND THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF HE BEGAN TO OVERWHELM THE COUNT WITH A TORRENT OF QUESTION
5105-28240-0016 TO ALL THESE INQUIRIES THE COLONEL RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
5105-28240-0017 THIS MYSTERIOUS FORCE SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A CONVULSION OF THE ELEMENTS
5105-28240-0018 YOU WOULD TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNT WILL YOU NOT
5105-28240-0019 MY YACHT IS AT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRE TO MAKE A TOUR OVER THE WORLD
5105-28240-0020 THE PRINCE SHOOK HIS HEAD
5105-28240-0021 BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE ENGINE OF THE DOBRYNA SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVASS ONLY WOULD IN CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS BE MOST TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT
5105-28240-0022 IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THAT SCHOONER WERE COMPLETED
5105-28240-0023 A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE USUAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
5105-28240-0024 DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BEN ZOOF TO ACCOMPANY HIS SISTER
5105-28241-0000 HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED TO A CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE GLOBE
5105-28241-0001 AFTER AN APPRENTICESHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHEN THE COUNCIL APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YACHT IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHILST IN THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS
5105-28241-0002 THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOPE MANIFESTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
5105-28241-0003 STEAM UP AND CANVAS'S SPREAD THE SCHOONER STARTED EASTWARDS
5105-28241-0004 ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING AND THE SEA WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMINUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARTICLES SO BUOYANT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF OSCILLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THAT WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED
5105-28241-0005 FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALGERIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED IN THE SOUTH
5105-28241-0006 THE LOG AND THE COMPASS THEREFORE WERE READY TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SEXTANT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS
5105-28241-0007 THERE HAS NO FEAR OF THAT SIR
5105-28241-0008 THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW ORBIT BUT SHE IS NOT INCURRING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED INTO THE SUN
5105-28241-0009 AND WHICH DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVADAC EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN
5105-28241-0010 OCEAN REIGNED SUPREMELY
5105-28241-0011 ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FOREST ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE DEPTHS OF OCEAN WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE ALGERIAN METROPOLIS
5105-28241-0012 IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT EVERY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
5105-28241-0013 NOT THE LOFTIEST EMINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
5105-28241-0014 ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE THE MOST REMARKABLE
5105-28241-0015 TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM DEPTH OF FROM FOUR TO FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SITE OF A CITY THAT HAS BEEN TERRACED LIKE THE SEATS OF AN AMPHITHEATRE
5105-28241-0016 YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALMERIA AS YOU IMAGINED
5105-28241-0017 AFTER PONDERING A WHILE HE SAID IF HE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS FIVE FATHOMS
5105-28241-0018 ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO KEEP IT BARREN OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
5105-28241-0019 NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN IN DISAPPOINT TOWARD THE NORTH
5142-33396-0000 AT ANOTHER TIME HAROLD CALLED
5142-33396-0001 WHAT IS YOUR COUNTRY OLAF HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN A THRALL A THRALL'S EYES FLASHED
5142-33396-0002 TWO HUNDRED WARRIORS FEASTED IN HIS HALL AND CALLED HIM TO BATTLE
5142-33396-0003 THE REST OF YOU OFF A VIKING YOU HAD THREE SHIPS
5142-33396-0004 THESE HE GAVE TO THREE OF THEIR BROTHERS
5142-33396-0005 BUT I STAID THAT SPRING AND BUILT ME A BOAT
5142-33396-0006 I MADE HER WITH ONLY TWENTY OARS BECAUSE I THOUGHT FEW MEN WOULD FOLLOW ME FOR I WAS YOUNG FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
5142-33396-0007 AT THE PROW I GATHERED THE HEAD WITH OPEN MOUTH AND FORKED TONGUE THRUST OUT
5142-33396-0008 I CHANGED THE EYES RED FOR ANGER
5142-33396-0009 THERE STAY SO I SAID AND GLARE AND HISS AT MY FOES
5142-33396-0010 IN THE STERN I CARVED THE TAIL UP ALMOST AS HIGH AS A HEAD
5142-33396-0011 THERE SHE SAT ON HER ROLLERS AS FAIR A SHIP AS I EVER SAW
5142-33396-0012 THEN I SHALL GET ME A FARM AND WILL WIN HER IN THAT LAND NOW WHO WILL FOLLOW ME
5142-33396-0013 HE IS NOT A BOY THE MAN SAID
5142-33396-0014 THIRTY MAN ONE AFTER ANOTHER RAISED THEIR HORNS AND SAID
5142-33396-0015 AS OUR BOAT FLASHED DOWN THE ROLLING INTO THE WATER I MADE THIS SONG AND SANG IT
5142-33396-0016 AS WE HARRIED THE COAST OF NORWAY
5142-33396-0017 WE ATE FROM MANY MEN'S TABLES UNINVITED
5142-33396-0018 MY DRAGON'S BELLY IS EVER FULL AND ON BOARD WENT THE GOLD
5142-33396-0019 OH IT IS BETTER TO LIVE ON THE SEA AND LET OTHER MEN RAISE CROPS AND COOK YOUR MEALS
5142-33396-0020 A HOUSE SMELLS OF SMOKE A FOOT SMELLS OF FROLIC
5142-33396-0021 UP AND DOWN THIS WATER WE WENT TO GET MUCH WEALTH AND MUCH FROLIC
5142-33396-0022 WHAT OF THE FARMER OLOFFE NOT YET I ANSWERED VIKING IS BETTER FOR SUMMER
5142-33396-0023 IT WAS SO DARK THAT I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A FEW SPARS ON THE HEARTH
5142-33396-0024 I STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL FOR I WANTED NO WORDS REACHING OUT OF THE DARK FOR ME
5142-33396-0025 COME COME I CRIED WHEN NO ONE OBEYED A FIRE
5142-33396-0026 MY MEN LAUGHED AS A STINGY HOST
5142-33396-0027 HE ACTS AS THOUGH SHE HAD NOT EXPECTED US
5142-33396-0028 ON A BENCH IN A FOREST CORNER WERE A DOZEN PEOPLE HUDDLED TOGETHER
5142-33396-0029 BRING IN THE STABLE WE ARE HUNGRY
5142-33396-0030 THE THRALLS WERE BRINGING IN A GREAT BOTTLE OF MEAT
5142-33396-0031 THEY SET UP A CRANE OVER THE FIRE AND HUNG THE POT UPON IT AND WE SAT AND WATCHED IT BOIL WHILE WE STROKED AT LAST THE SUPPER BEGAN
5142-33396-0032 THE FARMER SAT GLOOMILY ON THE BENCH AND DID NOT EAT AND YOU CANNOT WONDER FOR HE SAW US PUTTING POTFULS OF HIS GOOD BEEF AND BASKET LOADS OF BREAD INTO OUR BIG MOUTHS
5142-33396-0033 YOU COULD NOT EAT WITH US YOU CANNOT SAY NO TO HALF OF MY ALE I DRINK THIS TO YOUR HEALTH
5142-33396-0034 THEN I DRANK HALF OF THAT HORNFUL AND SET THE REST ACROSS THE FIRE TO THE FARMER HE TOOK IT AND SMILED SAYING
5142-33396-0035 DID YOU EVER HAVE SUCH A LORDLY GUEST BEFORE SHE WENT ON
5142-33396-0036 SO I WILL BRING OUT THIS LAW THAT MY MEN SHALL NEVER LEAVE YOU ALONE
5142-33396-0037 HOCKIN THEY SHALL BE YOUR CONSTANT COMPANION FRIEND FARMER
5142-33396-0038 HE WILL NOT LEAVE YOU DAY OR NIGHT WHETHER YOU WERE WORKING OR PLAYING OR SLEEPING
5142-33396-0039 I NAMED NINE OTHERS AND SAY
5142-33396-0040 AND THESE SHALL FOLLOW YOUR THRALLS IN THIS SAME WAY
5142-33396-0041 SO I SENT GUARDS OVER EVERY ONE IN THAT HOUSE
5142-33396-0042 SO NO TAILS GOT OUT TO THE NEIGHBOURS BECAUSE IT WAS A LONELY PLACE AND BY GOOD LUCK NO ONE CAME THAT WAY
5142-33396-0043 THEIR EYES DANCED LIKE TORE LEAF STOOD UP AND STRETCHED HIMSELF
5142-33396-0044 I'M STIFF WITH LONG SITTING HE SAID I ITCH FOR A FIGHT I TURNED TO A FARMER
5142-33396-0045 THIS IS OUR LAST FEAST TO YOU I SAID
5142-33396-0046 BY THE BEARD OF ODIN I CRIED YOU HAVE TAKEN OUR JOKE LIKE MAN
5142-33396-0047 MY MEN POUNDED THEIR TABLE WITH THEIR FISTS
5142-33396-0048 BY THE HAMMER OF THOR SHOUTED GRIM THERE IS NO STINGY CROWD
5142-33396-0049 HERE FRIEND TOOK IT AND HE THRUST IT INTO THE FARMER'S HAND
5142-33396-0050 MAYBE YOU DRINK HEART'S EASE FROM IT FOR MANY YEARS
5142-33396-0051 AND WITH IT I LEAVE YOU A NAME SIFT THE FRIENDLY I SHALL HOPE TO DRINK WITH YOU SOMETIME IN VALHALLA
5142-33396-0052 HERE IS A RING FOR SIFT A FRIENDLY AND HERE IS A BRACELET AND A SWORD WOULD NOT BE ASHAMED TO HANG AT YOUR SIDE
5142-33396-0053 I TOOK FIVE GREEN BRACELETS OF GOLD FROM OUR TREASURE CHEST AND GAVE THEM TO HIM
5142-33396-0054 IT IS THE BEST WAY TO DECIDE FOR THE SPEAR WILL ALWAYS POINT SOMEWHERE AND ONE THING IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER
5142-33396-0055 THAT TIME IT POINTED INTO YOUR FATHER'S SHIPS
5142-33396-0056 HERE THEY SAID IS A RASCAL WHO HAS BEEN HARRYING YOUR COASTS
5142-33396-0057 WE SUNK THIS SHIP AND MEN BUT HIM WE BROUGHT TO YOU
5142-33396-0058 A WARRIOR VIKING SAID THE KING AND HE SCOWLED AT ME
5142-33396-0059 YES AND WITH ALL YOUR FINGERS IT TOOK YOU A YEAR TO CATCH ME THE KING FROWNED MOST ANGRILY
5142-33396-0060 TAKE HIM OUT TORVELL AND LET HIM TASTE YOUR SWORD
5142-33396-0061 YOUR WIFE THE QUEEN WAS STANDING BY
5142-33396-0062 WHEN SHE PUT HER HAND ON HIS ARM AND SMILED AND SAID
5142-33396-0063 AND WOULD HE NOT BE A GOOD GIFT FOR OUR LADY
5142-33396-0064 YOUR FATHER THOUGHT A MOMENT HE LOOKED AT YOUR MOTHER AND SMILED
5142-33396-0065 SOFT HEART HE SAID GENTLY TO HER THEN TO TORKELE WELL LET US GO TORKELL
5142-33396-0066 THEN HE TURNED TO ME AGAIN FROWNED
5142-33396-0067 BUT YOUNG SHARP TONGUE NOW THAT WE HAVE CAUGHT YOU WE'LL PUT YOU INTO A TRAP THAT YOU CANNOT GET OUT OF
5142-33396-0068 SO I LIVED AND NOW I'M YOUR TOOTH THRALL WELL THAT IS THE LUCK OF WAR
5142-36377-0000 IT WAS ONE OF THE MASTERLY AND CHARMING STORIES OF DU MARTIN THE ELDER
5142-36377-0001 IN FIVE MINUTES I WAS IN A NEW WORLD AND MY MECHANICAL ROOM WAS FULL OF THE LIVELIEST FRENCH COMPANY
5142-36377-0002 THE SOUND OF AN IMPERATIVE OR UNCOMPROMISING BELL RECALLED ME IN DUE TIME TO THE REGIONS OF REALITY
5142-36377-0003 AMBROSE MET ME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND SHOWED ME A WAY TO THE SUPPER ROOM
5142-36377-0004 SHE SIGNED TO ME WITH A GHOSTLY SOLEMNITY TO TAKE THIS VACANT PLACE ON THE LEFT OF HER FATHER
5142-36377-0005 THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN WHEN I WAS STILL STUDYING THE TWO BROTHERS WITHOUT I HONESTLY CONFESS BEING VERY FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY EITHER OF THEM
5142-36377-0006 A NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CIRCLE WHO INSTANTLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION ENTERED A ROOM
5142-36377-0007 A LITTLE CRACKED THAT AND THE POPULAR PHRASE WAS MY IMPRESSION OF THE STRANGER WHO NOW MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE SUPPER ROOM
5142-36377-0008 MISTER MEADOWCROFT THE ELDER HAVING NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD THUS FAR HIMSELF INTRODUCED THE NEW COMER TO ME WITH A SIDE GLANCE AT HIS SONS WHICH HAD SOMETHING LIKE DEFIANCE IN IT A GLANCE WHICH I WAS SORRY TO NOTICE WAS RETURNED WITH A DEFIANCE ON THEIR SIDE BY THE TWO YOUNG MEN
5142-36377-0009 PHILIP LE FRANK THIS IS MY OVERLOOKER MISTER DAGO SAID THE OLD MAN FORMALLY PRESENTING US
5142-36377-0010 HE IS NOT ILL HE HAS COME OVER THE OCEAN FOR REST AND CHANGE OF SCENE
5142-36377-0011 MISTER JAGO IS A AMERICAN PHILIP
5142-36377-0012 MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER IAGO SIT TOGETHER
5142-36377-0013 THEY POINTEDLY DREW BACK FROM JOHN MAGO AS HE APPROACHED THE EMPTY CHAIR NEXT TO ME AND MOVED ROUND TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE
5142-36377-0014 A PRETTY GIRL AND SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE BY APPEARANCES A GOOD GIRL TOO DESCRIBING HER GENERALLY I MAY SAY THAT SHE HAD A SMALL HEAD WELL CARRIED AND WELL SET ON HER SHOULDERS BRIGHT BROWN EYES THAT LOOKED AT YOU HONESTLY AND MEANT WHAT THEY LOOKED A TRIM SLIGHT LITTLE FIGURE TOO SLIGHT FOR OUR ENGLISH NOTIONS OF BEAUTY A STRONG AMERICAN ACCENT AND A RARE THING IN AMERICA A PLEASANTLY TONED VOICE WHICH MADE THE ACCENT AGREEABLE TO ENGLISH EARS
5142-36377-0015 THEIR FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF PEOPLE ARE IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN THE RIGHT IMPRESSIONS
5142-36377-0016 FOR ONCE IN A WAY I PROVED A TRULY PROPHET
5142-36377-0017 THE ONLY BEAUTIFUL CONVERSATION WAS THE CONVERSATION ACROSS THE TABLE BETWEEN NAOMI AND ME
5142-36377-0018 HE LOOKED UP AT NAOMI DOUBTINGLY FROM HIS PLATE AND LOOKED DOWN THEN SLOWLY WITH A FROWN
5142-36377-0019 WHEN I HAD ADDRESSED HIM HE ANSWERED CONSTRAINEDLY
5142-36377-0020 A MORE GLOOMY AND MORE DISUNITED FAMILY PARTY I NEVER SAT AT TABLE WITH
5142-36377-0021 ENVY HATRED MALICE AND UNCHARITABLENESS ARE NEVER SO ESSENTIALLY DETESTABLE TO MY MIND AS WHEN THEY ARE ANIMATED BY THE SENSE OF PROPRIETY AND WORK UNDER THE SURFACE BUT FOR MY INTEREST IN NAOMI AND MY OTHER INTEREST IN THE LITTLE LOVE BOOKS WHICH I NOW AND THEN SURPRISED PASSING BETWEEN HER AND AMBROSE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SAT THROUGH THAT SUPPER
5142-36377-0022 I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT SHE LAID HER BONY HANDS ON THE BACK OF MISTER MEADOWCROFT'S INVALID CHAIR CUT HIM SHORT IN HIS FAREWELL SALUTATION TO ME AND WHEELED HIM OUT TO HIS BED AS IF SHE WERE WHEELING HIM BACK TO HIS GRAVE
5142-36377-0023 YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT TO SAY THAT AMBROSE BEGAN NEVER SMOKE WITH JOHN IAGO HIS CIGARS WILL POISON YOU
5142-36377-0024 NAOMI SHOOK HER FOREFINGER REPROACHIVELY AT THEM AS IF THE TWO STURDY YOUNG FARMERS HAD BEEN TWO CHILDREN
5142-36377-0025 SILAS SLUNK AWAY WITHOUT A WORD OF PROTEST AMBROSE STOOD HIS GROUND EVIDENTLY BENT ON MAKING HIS PEACE WITH NAOMI BEFORE HE LEFT HER SEEING THAT I WAS IN THE WAY I WALKED ASIDE TOWARD A GLASS DOOR AT THE UPPER END OF THE ROOM
5142-36586-0000 IT IS MANIFEST THAT MAN IS NOW SUBJECT TO MORE VARIABILITY
5142-36586-0001 SO IT IS WITH THE LOWER ANIMALS ANIMALS
5142-36586-0002 THE VARIABILITY OF MULTIPLEMENTS
5142-36586-0003 BUT THIS SUBJECT WILL BE MORE PROPERLY DISCUSSED WHEN THEY TREAT OF THE DIFFERENT RACES OF MANKIND
5142-36586-0004 EFFECTS OF A INCREASED USE AND DISUSE OF PARTS
5142-36600-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN ON THE RACES OF MAN
5142-36600-0001 IN DETERMINING WHETHER TWO OR MORE ALLIED FORMS ARE TO BE RANKED AS SPECIES OR VARIETIES NATURALISTS ARE PRACTICALLY GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS NAMELY THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND WHETHER SUCH DIFFERENCES RELATE TO FEW OR MANY POINTS OF STRUCTURE AND WHETHER THEY ARE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE BUT MORE ESPECIALLY WHETHER THEY ARE CONSTANT
5639-40744-0000 ELEVEN O'CLOCK HAD STRUCK IT WAS A FINE CLEAR NIGHT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS ON THE ROAD AND THEY SAUNTERED LEISURELY ALONG TO AVOID PAYING THE PRICE OF FATIGUE FOR THE RECREATION PROVIDED FOR THE TOEDANS IN THE VALLEY OR ON THE BANKS OF THEIR RIVER
5639-40744-0001 SECURE AS HE THOUGHT IN THE CAREFUL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THAT CITY AND THE CHARACTER OF ITS WELL DISPOSED INHABITANTS THE GOOD HIDALGO WAS FAR FROM THINKING THAT ANY DISASTER CAN BEFALL HIS FAMILY
5639-40744-0002 RUDOLPHO AND HIS COMPANIONS WITH THEIR FACES MUFFLED IN THEIR CLOAKS STARED RUDELY AND INSOLENTLY AT THE MOTHER THE FATHER AND THE SERVANT MAID
5639-40744-0003 IN A MOMENT HE COMMUNICATED HIS THOUGHTS TO HIS COMPANIONS AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT THEY RESOLVED TO TURN BACK AND CARRY HER OFF TO PLEASE RUDOLPHO FOR THE RICH WHO ARE OPEN HANDED ALWAYS FIND PARASITES READY TO ENCOURAGE THEIR BAD PROPENSITIES AND THUS TO CONCEIVE THIS WICKED DESIGN TO COMMUNICATE IT APPROVE IT RESOLVE UPON RAVISHING LEOCADIA AND TO CARRY THAT DESIGN INTO EFFECT WAS THE WORK OF A MOMENT
5639-40744-0004 THEY DREW THEIR SWORDS HID THEIR FACES IN THE FLAPS OF THEIR CLOAKS TURNED BACK AND SOON CAME IN FRONT OF THEIR LITTLE PARTY WHO HAD NOT YET DONE GIVING THANKS TO GOD FOR THEIR ESCAPE FROM THOSE AUDACIOUS MEN
5639-40744-0005 ONLY THE ONE PARTY WENT OFF EXULTING AND THE OTHER WAS LEFT IN DESOLATION AND WOE
5639-40744-0006 UDOLPHO ARRIVED AT HIS OWN HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT AND LEACADIA'S PARENTS REACHED THEIRS HEARTBROKEN AND DESPAIRING
5639-40744-0007 MEANWHILE UDOLPHO HAD LEOCADIA SAFE IN HIS CUSTODY AND HIS OWN APARTMENT
5639-40744-0008 WHO WATCHES ME AM I IN BED
5639-40744-0009 MOTHER DEAR FATHER DO YOU FEAR ME
5639-40744-0010 IT IS THE ONLY AMENDS I ASK OF YOU FOR THE WRONG YOU HAVE DONE
5639-40744-0011 YOU FOUND THE DOOR BUT IT WAS LOCKED OUTSIDE
5639-40744-0012 SHE SUCCEEDED IN OPENING THAT WINDOW AND THE MOONLIGHT SHONE IN SO BRIGHTLY THAT SHE COULD DISTINGUISH THE COLOR OF SOME DAMASK HANGING IN THE ROOM
5639-40744-0013 SHE SAW THAT THE BED WAS GILDED AND SO RICH THAT IT SEEMED THAT OF A PRINCE RATHER THAN OF A PIRATE GENTLEMAN
5639-40744-0014 AMONG OTHER THINGS TO WHICH SHE CAST HER EYES WAS A SMALL CRUCIFIX OF SOLID SILVER STANDING ON A CABINET NEAR THE WINDOW
5639-40744-0015 THIS PERSON WAS UDOLPHO WHO THOUGH HE HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR HIS FRIENDS HAD CHANGED HIS MIND IN THAT RESPECT NOT THINKING IT ADVISABLE TO ACQUAINT THEM WITH WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE GIRLS
5639-40744-0016 ON THE CONTRARY HE RESOLVED TO TELL THEM THAT REPENTING OF HIS VIOLENCE AND MOVED BY A TEAR HE HAD ONLY CARRIED HER HALF WAY TOWARDS THIS HOUSE AND THEN LET HER GO
5639-40744-0017 CHOKING WITH EMOTION LEWCADIA MADE A SIGN TO HER PARENTS THAT SHE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH THEM
5639-40744-0018 THAT WOULD BE VERY WELL MY CHILD REPLIED HER FATHER IF YOUR PLAN WERE NOT LIABLE TO BE FRUSTRATED BY ORDINARY CUNNING BUT NO DOUBT THIS IMAGE HAD BEEN ALREADY MISSED BY ITS OWNER AND HE WILL HAVE SET IT DOWN FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THIS ROOM BY THE PERSON HE LOCKED UP THERE
5639-40744-0019 WHAT YOU HAD BEST DO MY CHILD IS TO KEEP IT AND SAY TO IT THAT SINCE IT WAS A WITNESS TO YOUR UNDOING IT WILL DEIGN TO VINDICATE YOUR CAUSE BY ITS RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT
5639-40744-0020 THIS DID THE HUMANE AND RIGHT MINDED FATHER COMFORT HIS UNHAPPY DAUGHTER AND HER MOTHER EMBRACING HER AGAIN DID ALL SHE COULD TO SOOTHE THE FEELINGS
5639-40744-0021 SHE MEANWHILE PASSED HER LIFE WITH HER PARENTS IN THE STRICTEST RETIREMENT NEVER LETTING HERSELF BE SEEN BUT SHUNNING EVERY EYES LEST IT SHOULD READ HER MISFORTUNE IN HER FACE
5639-40744-0022 TIME ROLLED ON THE HOUR OF HER DELIVERY ARRIVED THERE TOOK PLACE IN THE UTMOST SECRECY HER MOTHER TAKING UPON HER THE OFFICE OF MIDWIFE AND SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EVER SEEN
5639-40744-0023 WHEN THE BOY WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS BLESSINGS WERE SHOWERED UPON HIM BY ALL WHO SOUGHT HIM BLESSING UPON HIS BEAUTY UPON THE MOTHER THAT BORE HIM UPON THE FATHER THAT BEGOT HIM UPON THOSE WHO BROUGHT HIM UP SO WELL
5639-40744-0024 ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS SENT BY HIS GRANDFATHER WITH A MESSAGE TO A RELATION HE PASSED ALONG A STREET ON WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT CONCOURSE OF HORSEMEN
5639-40744-0025 THE BED SHE TOO WELL REMEMBERED WAS THERE AND ABOVE ALL THE CABINET ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAGE SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WERE STILL ON THE SAME SPOT
5639-40744-0026 LEWIS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT IN A MONTH HE ROSE FROM HIS BED AND DURING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS HER OWN CHILD
5639-40744-0027 THUS SAYING AND PRESSING THE CRUCIFIX TO HER BREAST SHE FELL FAINTING INTO THE ARMS OF DONA ESTAPHANA WHO AS A GENTLEWOMAN TO WHOSE SEX PITY IS AS NATURAL AS CRUELTY AS TO A MAN INSTANTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO THOSE OF THE FAINTING GIRL SHEDDING OVER HER SO MANY TEARS THAT THERE NEEDED NO OTHER SPRINKLING OF WATER TO RECOVER LEOCADIA FROM HER SWOON
5639-40744-0028 I HAVE GREAT THINGS TO TELL YOU SENOR SAID DONA STEPHANIA TO HER HUSBAND THE CREAM AND SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS THIS THE FAINTING GIRL BEFORE YOU IS OUR DAUGHTER AND THE BOY IS YOUR GRANDSON
5639-40744-0029 THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAVE LEARNED FROM YOUR LIPS IS CONFIRMED BY HIS FACE IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH BEHELD THAT OF OUR SON
5639-40744-0030 JUST THEN LEOCADIA CAME TO HERSELF AND EMBRACING THE CROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO A SEA OF TEARS AND THE GENTLEMAN REMAINING IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END LEOCADIA'S WHOLE STORY AND HE BELIEVED IT THROUGH THE BLESSED DISPENSATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONFIRMED IT WITH SO MANY CONVINCING TESTIMONIES
5639-40744-0031 SO PERSUASIVE WERE HER ENTREATIES AND SO STRONG HER ASSURANCE THAT NO HARM WHATEVER COULD RESULT TO THEM FROM THE INFORMATION SHE SOUGHT THEY WERE INDUCED TO CONFESS THAT ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MENTIONED THEMSELVES AND ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON A STROLL WITH RUDOLPHO THEY HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN THE ABDUCTION OF A GIRL WHOM RUDOLPHO CARRIED OFF WHILST THE REST OF THEM DETAINED HER FAMILY WHO MADE A GREAT OUTCRY AND WOULD HAVE DEFENDED HER IF THEY COULD
5639-40744-0032 FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LADY MOTHER GIVE ME A WIFE WHO WOULD BE AN AGREEABLE COMPANION TO ONE WHO WILL DISGUST ME SO THAT WE MAY BOTH BEAR EVENLY AND WITH MUTUAL GOOD WILL THE YOKE IMPOSED ON US BY HEAVEN INSTEAD OF PULLING THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AND FRETTING EACH OTHER TO DEATH
5639-40744-0033 HER BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE LED HER SISTER BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MAIDS WITH WAX LIGHTS AND SILVER CANDLESTICKS
5639-40744-0034 ALL ROSE TO DO HER REVERENCE AS IF SOMETHING FROM HEAVEN HAD MIRACULOUSLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM BUT GAZING ON HER ENTRANCED WITH ADMIRATION NO ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS A SINGLE WORD TO HER
5639-40744-0035 SHE REFLECTED HOW NEAR SHE STOOD TO THE CRISIS WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED OR UNHAPPY FOR EVER AND RACKED BY THE INTENSITY OF HER EMOTIONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOUR HER HEAD DROPPED AND SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SWOON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DISMAYED ASTAPHANIA
5639-40744-0036 HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DEVOTED PROTECTOR BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS INSENSIBLE SHE WAS NEAR MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD HE NOT COME TO HIMSELF
5639-40744-0037 KNOW THEN SON OF MY HEART THAT THIS FAINTING LADY IS YOUR REAL BRIDE I SAY REAL BECAUSE SHE IS THAT ONE WHOM YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOU AND THE PORTRAIT WAS A PRETENCE
5639-40744-0038 JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE TEARS OF THE PITYING BEHOLDERS FLOWED FASTEST AND THEIR EJACULATIONS WAS MOST EXPRESSIVE OF DESPAIR LEOCADIA GAVE SIGNS OF RECOVERY AND BROUGHT BACK GLADNESS TO THE HEARTS OF ALL
5639-40744-0039 WHEN SHE CAME TO HER SENSES AND BLUSHED TO FIND HERSELF IN RODOLPHO'S ARMS WOULD HAVE DISENGAGED HERSELF NO SENORA HE SAID THAT MUST NOT BE STRIVE NOT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE ARMS OF HIM WHO HOLDS YOU IN HIS SOUL
5639-40744-0040 THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF OUR MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH ARE NOW SO PROPERLY REQUIRED
5639-40744-0041 NOR WAS RODOLPHO LESS SURPRISED THAN THEY AND THE BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF SO WONDERFUL A FACT HE BEGGED LOCANDIA TO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENTICATED BY HIS PARENTS
5683-32865-0000 YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LEATH
5683-32865-0001 SAID LORD BELFORD ADDRESSING ME
5683-32865-0002 HE HAD HIS HAND UPON LEAL'S SHOULDER
5683-32865-0003 THEY ARE COUSINS YOU SEE WE ARE ALL COUSINS
5683-32865-0004 WHATEVER LORD CHELFORD SAID MISS BRANDON ACCEPTED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
5683-32865-0005 BUT HER GREETINGS TO CAPTAIN LEEK WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
5683-32865-0006 AT DINNER LAKE WAS EASIER AND AMUSING
5683-32865-0007 I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WYLDER CHUCKLING BENIGNENTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
5683-32865-0008 I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THEIR JEWELS
5683-32865-0009 AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS HE NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALLELOGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLY AMUSEMENT
5683-32865-0010 I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING OUT
5683-32865-0011 WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTHS WITH HIS SLY EYES
5683-32865-0012 AND WYLDER LAUGHED TOO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOUR OF THE JOKE SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES ON LEAH BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DOROTHY ONLY REMARKING
5683-32865-0013 DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT WE'LL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
5683-32865-0014 IT'S NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS
5683-32865-0015 I HAD A HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THIS
5683-32865-0016 OH I KNOW THAT'S LOR BRANDON
5683-32865-0017 ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LINK
5683-32866-0000 MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TO BED
5683-32866-0001 AS HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY
5683-32866-0002 BUT DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURNED OUT VERY FOOLISHLY
5683-32866-0003 IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORMED A NEW IDEA OF IT
5683-32866-0004 BY THIS TIME LORD CHELFORD AND WYLDER RETURNED AND DISGUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANTS OF GENERALSHIP
5683-32866-0005 AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CANE TOWARDS BRANDON HALL ON HIS SHOULDER
5683-32866-0006 OH YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORSE
5683-32866-0007 IF A FELLOW'S BEING A LITTLE BIT WILD HE'S BEELZEBUB AT ONCE
5683-32866-0008 BRACTON'S A GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU
5683-32866-0009 I DON'T KNOW AND CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FINE GENTLEMEN DEFINE WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMALE I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LIGHTS BUT HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY
5683-32866-0010 WELL YOU KNOW RODIE WOMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS IT IS CONTRAST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND I'M SURE FROM WHAT BRACTON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY THAT DORCAS LIKES HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED
5683-32866-0011 THEIR WALKS CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHEL AT LAST SAID
5683-32866-0012 NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE RADIE FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE ARE TALKING
5683-32866-0013 THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOONLIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOUGHS AND WITHERED LEAVES AND THE MOTTLED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED WIDELY ACROSS HIS PALE FEATURES
5683-32866-0014 DON'T INSULT ME STANLEY BY COMING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING
5683-32866-0015 WHAT I SAY IS ALTOGETHER OF YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
5683-32866-0016 MARK MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND EM TOO STRONG FOR YOU AY AND TOO DEEP
5683-32866-0017 I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHENEVER IT IS I CAN'T HELP IT
5683-32866-0018 TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FEUDS
5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVE THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTHED MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEWBORN GENERATION HAD ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND ESPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
5683-32866-0020 THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT EASE OF THE ROOM
5683-32866-0021 MY BED WAS UNEXCEPTIONABLY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
5683-32866-0022 ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK OR FADED TAPESTRY
5683-32866-0023 ALL THE FURNITURE BELONGED TO THESE TIMES
5683-32866-0024 I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN A GHOST STORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY ON A HAUNTED CHAMBER
5683-32866-0025 I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF COMING UP THE CHIMNEY
5683-32866-0026 I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY CHEROOTE
5683-32866-0027 A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING THROUGH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
5683-32866-0028 THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC HEARSE PLUMES BLACK AND HOARSE
5683-32866-0029 SOMEWHERE I HAD GROWN NERVOUS
5683-32866-0030 A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDINGLY
5683-32879-0000 IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRANDON DREW UP BEFORE A LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMAN'S FARM
5683-32879-0001 WELL SHE WAS BETTER THO SHE HAD HAD A BAD NIGHT
5683-32879-0002 AS THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSTLING OF FEMININE DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF WELCOME
5683-32879-0003 WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN YOU MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL CHALICE
5683-32879-0004 BUT POOR RACHEL LAKE HAS MORE THAN THAT STOICAL HYPOCRISY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
5683-32879-0005 THIS TRANSIENT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOUR BEGUILED OUR SENSES
5683-32879-0006 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEW TO RACHAEL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREETING SO KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORMER SELF
5683-32879-0007 RACHA'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED EYE STRUCK HER WITH A PAINFUL SURPRISE
5683-32879-0008 YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POOR RAEL
5683-32879-0009 ILL AND TROUBLED DEAR AND TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISERABLY NERVOUS
5683-32879-0010 POOR RACHAEL HER NATURE RECOILED FROM DECEIT AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF A TRUTH AS SHE DARED
5683-32879-0011 SHE SPOKE WITH THE SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK OF FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH
5683-32879-0012 THANK YOU RACHAEL MY COUSINS RACHAEL MY ONLY FRIEND
5683-32879-0013 CHELFORD HAD A NOTE FROM MISSUS WYLDER THIS MORNING ANOTHER NOTE HIS COMING DELAYED AND SOMETHING OF HIS HAVING TO SEE SOME PERSON WHO WAS ABROAD CONTINUED DORCAS AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
5683-32879-0014 YES SOMETHING EVERYTHING SAID RACHEL HURRIEDLY LOOKING FROWNINGLY AT A LETTER WHICH SHE WAS TWIRLING IN HER FINGERS

5683-32879-0016 AND THE WAN ORACLES HAVING SPOKEN SHE SAT DOWN IN THE SAME SORT OF ABSTRACTION AGAIN BESIDE DORCAS AND SHE LOOKED FULL IN HER COUSIN'S EYES
5683-32879-0017 OF MARK WYLDER I SAY THIS HIS NAME HAS BEEN FOR YEARS HATEFUL TO ME AND RECENTLY IT HAS BECOME FRIGHTFUL AND YOU WILL PROMISE ME SIMPLY THIS THAT YOU WILL NEVER ASK ME TO SPEAK AGAIN OF HIM
5683-32879-0018 IT WAS AN ANTIPATHY AN ANTIPATHY I CANNOT GET OVER DEAR DORCAS YOU MAY THINK IT A MADNESS BUT DON'T BLAME ME
5683-32879-0019 I HAVE VERY FEW TO LOVE ME NOW AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LOVE ME AS I HAVE TO LOVE YOU
5683-32879-0020 AND SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HER COUSIN'S NECK AND BRAVE RACHEL AT LAST BURST IN TEARS
5683-32879-0021 DORCAS IN SOME STRANGE WAY WAS MOVED
5683-32879-0022 I LIKE YOU STILL RACHEL I'M SURE I LL ALWAYS LIKE YOU

61-70970-0013 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO ALTER HIS SLEEPING ROOM TO ONE NEARER TO GAMEWELL'S CABIN
61-70970-0014 PRESENTLY HE CROSSED THE FLOOR OF A ROOM WITH DECIDED STEP
61-70970-0015 WILL CRY HE SOFTLY AND STUTELEY WHO HAD CHOSEN HIS COUCH ACROSS THE DOOR OF HIS YOUNG MASTER'S CHAMBER SPRANG UP AT ONCE IN ANSWER
61-70970-0016 WE SHALL GO OUT TOGETHER TO THE BOWER THERE IS A WAY DOWN TO THE COURT FROM MY WINDOW
61-70970-0017 REST AND BE STILL UNTIL I JOIN YOU
61-70970-0018 THE HOURS PASS WEARILY BY AND MOVEMENT COULD YET BE HEARD ABOUT THE HALL

61-70970-0020 WILL WHISPERED MADAME OPENING HIS DOOR AS HE SPOKE ARE YOU READY
61-70970-0021 THEY THEN RENEWED THEIR JOURNEY AND UNDER THEIR BETTER LIGHT MADE A SAFE CROSSING OF THE STABLE ROOFS
61-70970-0022 ROBIN ENTERED THE HUT DRAGGING THE UNWILLING ESQUIRE AFTER THEM
61-70970-0023 BE NOT SO FOOLISH FRIEND SAID FITZOOTH ROUGHLY
61-70970-0024 THEY MOVED THEREAFTER CAUTIOUSLY ABOUT THE HUT GROPING OVER AND ABOUT THEM TO FIND SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT WARRENTON HAD FULFILLED HIS MISSION
61-70970-0025 THEY WERE UPON THE VERGE OF AN OPEN TRAP IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE HUT AND STUTELEY HAD TRIPPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE REVERSED FLAPMOST OF THIS PIT
61-70970-0026 FITZOOTH'S EYES RESTED AT LAST UPON THE TOP RUNG OF A LADDER AND SLOWLY THE TRUTH CAME TO HIM
61-70970-0027 ROBIN CAREFULLY DESCENDED THE LADDER AND FOUND HERSELF SOON UPON FIRM ROCKY GROUND
61-70970-0028 STUTELEY WAS BY HIS SIDE IN A FLASH AND THEN THEY BOTH BEGAN FEELING ABOUT THEM TO ASCERTAIN THE SHAPE AND CHARACTER OF THIS VESSEL
61-70970-0029 FROM THE BLACKNESS BEHIND THE LIGHT THERE HEARD A VOICE WARRENTON'S
61-70970-0030 SAVE ME MASTERS BUT YOU HAVE STARTLED ME RARELY
61-70970-0031 CRIED HE WAVING THE LANTHORN BEFORE HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE WERE NO OBJECTS IN FRONT OF HIM
61-70970-0032 INQUIRED MARTIN WITH HIS SUSPICION STILL UPON HIM
61-70970-0033 TRULY SUCH A PIECE WOULD BE WORTH MUCH IN NOTTINGHAM FAIR
61-70970-0034 NAY NAY LORD HE ANSWERED WARRENTON WITH A HALF LAUGH
61-70970-0035 WARRENTON SPOKE THUS WITH SIGNIFICANCE TO SHOW ROBIN THAT HE WAS NOT TO THINK JEFFREY'S CLAIMS TO THE ESTATE COULD BE PASSED BY
61-70970-0036 ROBIN FITZOOTH SAW THAT HIS DOUBTS OF WARRENTON HAD BEEN UNFAIR AND HE BECAME ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR HARBORING HIM
61-70970-0037 HIS TONES RANG PLEASANTLY ON WARRENTON'S EARS AND FORTHWITH A GOOD FELLOWSHIP WAS HISALDED BETWEEN THEM
61-70970-0038 THE OLD SERVANT TOLD HIM QUIETLY AS THEY CREPT BACK TO GAMEWELL THAT THIS PASSAGEWAY LED FROM THE HUT IN PLEASAUNCE TO SHERWOOD AND THAT JEFFREY FOR THE TIME WAS HIDING WITH THE OUTLAWS IN THE FOREST

61-70970-0040 THEY REGAINED THEIR APARTMENT APPARENTLY WITHOUT DISTURBING THE HOUSEHOLD OF MANWELL
672-122797-0000 OUT IN THAT WOOD STOOD A NICE LITTLE FIR TREE
672-122797-0001 THAT PLACE HE HAD WAS A VERY GOOD ONE THE SUN SHONE ON HIM AS TO FRESH AIR THERE WAS ENOUGH OF THAT AND ROUND HIM GREW MANY LARGE SIZED COMRADES PINES AS WELL AS FIRS
672-122797-0002 HE DID NOT THINK OF THE WARM SUN AND OF THE FRESH AIR HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE LITTLE COTTAGE PEOPLE THAT RAN ABOUT AND PRATTLED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WOODS LOOKING FOR WILD STRAWBERRIES
672-122797-0003 BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE CHURCH COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR
672-122797-0004 IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY GLITTERING ON THE GROUND A HARE WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING OVER AND JUMP RIGHT OVER THE LITTLE TREE
672-122797-0005 YES THAT MADE HIM SO ANGRY
672-122797-0006 TO GROW AND GROW TO GET OLDER AND BE TALL THOUGHT THE GIRL THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL THING IN THE WORLD
672-122797-0007 OF AUTUMN THE WOODCUTTERS ALWAYS CAME AND FELLED SOME OF THE LARGEST TREES
672-122797-0008 THIS HAPPENED EVERY YEAR AND THE YOUNG FIR TREE THAT HAD NOW GROWN TO A VERY COMELY SIZE TREMBLED AT THE SIGHT FOR THE MAGNIFICENT GREAT TREES FELL TO THE EARTH WITH NOISE AND CRACKING THE BRANCHES WERE LOPPED OFF AND THE TREES LOOKED LONG AND BARE THEY WERE HARDLY TO BE RECOGNIZED AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARTS AND THE HORSES DRAGGING THEM OUT OF THE WOOD
672-122797-0009 HAVE YOU NOT MET THEM HERE
672-122797-0010 REJOICE IN THY BREATH SAID THE SUNBEAMS
672-122797-0011 AND THEN THAT HAPPENS THEN
672-122797-0012 I WOULD FAIN KNOW IF I AM DESTINED FOR SO GLORIOUS A CAREER CRIED THE TREE REJOICINGS
672-122797-0013 I AM NOW TALL AND MY BRANCHES SPREAD LIKE THE OTHERS THAT WERE CARRIED OFF LAST YEAR I
672-122797-0014 WERE I BUT ALREADY ON THE CARTS
672-122797-0015 WERE I IN THAT WARM ROOM WITH ALL THE SPLENDOR AND MAGNIFICENCE
672-122797-0016 YES THAT SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDER WILL SURELY FOLLOW OR WHEREFORE SHOULD THEY THUS ORNAMENT ME
672-122797-0017 SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDER MUST FOLLOW OR WHAT
672-122797-0018 REJOICE IN OUR PRESENT SAID THE AIR AND THE SUNLIGHT
672-122797-0019 REJOICE IN THY OWN FRESH EARTH
672-122797-0020 BUT THE TREE DID NOT REJOICE AT ALL HE GREW AND GREW AND WAS SEEN BOTH WINTER AND SUMMER
672-122797-0021 AND TOWARDS CHRISTMAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST WHICH WAS CUT DOWN
672-122797-0022 THE AXE STRUCK DEEP INTO THE VERY PITH THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANG IT WAS LIKE A SWOON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATED FROM THIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPRUNG UP
672-122797-0023 HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANYMORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS
672-122797-0024 BUT DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE
672-122797-0025 THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHER
672-122797-0026 THERE TOO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WORTH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN THOUGHT SO
672-122797-0027 THE SLAVES AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LADIES DECORATED IT
672-122797-0028 THIS EVENING THEY HAVE SAID
672-122797-0029 HOW IT WILL SHAKE THIS EVENING
672-122797-0030 PERHAPS THE OTHER TREES ON THE FOREST WILL COME TO LOOK AT ME
672-122797-0031 IT BLAZED UP AMAZINGLY HELP HELP
672-122797-0032 CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRES
672-122797-0033 IT STORY
672-122797-0034 A STORY CRIED THE CHILDREN DROPPING A LITTLE FAT MAN TOWARDS THE TREE
672-122797-0035 BUT I SHALL HEAR ONLY ONE STORY
672-122797-0036 HUMPY DUMPY FELL DOWN THE STAIRS AND YET HE MARRIED THE PRINCESS
672-122797-0037 THAT'S THE WAY OF THIS WORLD
672-122797-0038 THOUGHT THE FIR TREE AND BELIEVED IT ALL BECAUSE THE MAN WHO TOLD THE STORY WAS SO GOOD LOOKING BUT WELL
672-122797-0039 I WON'T TRY TO MORROW THOUGHT THE FIR TREE
672-122797-0040 AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TRAIN STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT
672-122797-0041 IN THE MORNING HIS SERVANT AND THE HOUSEMAID CAME IN
672-122797-0042 BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE HALL AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM
672-122797-0043 WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THE THOUGHT THE TREE
672-122797-0044 AND THEY LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIE
672-122797-0045 TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TWO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY
672-122797-0046 TIS NOW WINTER OUT OF DOORS THOUGHT THAT TREE
672-122797-0047 HOW KIND I IS AFTER ALL
672-122797-0048 IF IT ONLY WERE NOT SO DARK YES AND SO TERRIBLY LONELY
672-122797-0049 SQUEAK SQUEAK IT
672-122797-0050 THEY SNUFFLED ABOUT THE FIR TREE AND RUSTLED AMONG THE BRANCHES
672-122797-0051 I AM BY NO MEANS OLD ANSWERED THE FIR TREE
672-122797-0052 THERE'S MANY A ONE CONSIDER'ABLY OLDER THAN I AM
672-122797-0053 THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY GRACIOUS
672-122797-0054 I KNOW OF NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE TREE
672-122797-0055 AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LAUGHED AND SAID
672-122797-0056 SAID THE FIR TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF
672-122797-0057 BUT IN REALITY THOSE WERE HAPPY TIMES
672-122797-0058 WHO IS HUMPY BUMPY ASKED THE MICE
672-122797-0059 ONLY THAT ONE ANSWERED THE THREE
672-122797-0060 IT IS A VERY DESPERATE STORY
672-122797-0061 DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BACON AN TALLOW CANDLES CAN'T YOU TELL ANY LARDER STORIES
672-122797-0062 NO SAID THE PRIEST
672-122797-0063 WELL GOOD BYE SAID THE RATS AND THEY WENT HOME
672-122797-0064 AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALSO AND THE TREE SIGHED AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN A SLEEK LITTLE MICE SAT ROUND ME AND LISTENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM
672-122797-0065 AND NOW THAT TOO IS OVER
672-122797-0066 WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE WHO SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT
672-122797-0067 THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW IT TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE
672-122797-0068 BUT IT WAS NOT THE FIR TREE WHICH THEY MEANT
672-122797-0069 IT WAS IN A QUARTER THAT HE LAY AMONG WEEDS AND NETTLES
672-122797-0070 THIS GOLDEN STAR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE
672-122797-0071 IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MERRIAD CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS AROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
672-122797-0072 AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHIPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE
672-122797-0073 THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BREWING COPPER AND THEY SIGHED SO DEEPLY
672-122797-0074 HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE WENT THE STORY AT AN END
6829-68769-0000 KENNETH AND BETH REFRAINED FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGERS'S VISIT BUT THEY CAUGHT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORGING A CHECK
6829-68769-0001 IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN THE STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE RASH ACT
6829-68769-0002 I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LION
6829-68769-0003 HE WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
6829-68769-0004 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WERE INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
6829-68769-0005 HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE SHE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
6829-68769-0006 IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGED CHECK AND THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68769-0007 BUT UNDER THAT CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
6829-68769-0008 FAIRVIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY RAILWAY
6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKEM WHO WAS THE JAILER
6829-68769-0010 WE WISH TO TALK WITH YOU ANSWERED KENNETH TALK
6829-68769-0011 I'M RUNNING FOR REPRESENTATIVE AND THE REPUBLICAN TICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
6829-68769-0012 OH SIR THAT'S DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING HIS DEMEANOUR
6829-68769-0013 MAY WE SEE A GOATS AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0014 THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ACROSS A SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES
6829-68769-0015 SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARNING FOR SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE DYIN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
6829-68769-0016 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HERE'S VISITORS SAM
6829-68769-0017 WORSE TOM WORSE'N EVER REPLIED THE JAILOR GLOOMILY
6829-68769-0018 MISS DE GRAF SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHTS FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
6829-68769-0019 SORRY YOU HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE JAIL
6829-68769-0020 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID GATES IN THE CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A BENCH HERE
6829-68769-0021 A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GATES WITH STEADY GRAY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER SWEET MOUTH
6829-68769-0022 WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND IS INTERESTED IN IT
6829-68769-0023 I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT
6829-68769-0024 YOUNG WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
6829-68769-0025 THEN RODGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEAD HER ABOUT AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN
6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE DEEPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
6829-68769-0027 WHOSE NAME DOES YOU SIGN TO THE CHEQUE ASKED KENNETH
6829-68769-0028 HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE SHARES OF THE CONCERN
6829-68769-0029 IT'S A STOCK COMPANY DERICH
6829-68769-0030 I WAS PICK KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHEQUE AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0031 AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I PAID HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
6829-68769-0032 I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARTIAL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE WORLD UNFEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
6829-68769-0034 I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAYS KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
6829-68769-0035 IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT I'M AWFUL TO FIND A FRIEND
6829-68769-0036 THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE MAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
6829-68769-0037 I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND OF MY DAY
6829-68769-0038 AND IT RUINED A MAN'S DISPOSITION
6829-68769-0039 HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACIOUSLY THEN MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED
6829-68769-0040 ONE GIRL HAS BEEN IN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
6829-68769-0041 I I'M NOT ELECTIONEERING JUST NOW
6829-68769-0042 WELL SIR WHAT ABOUT EM
6829-68769-0043 AND SHE DESERVES A TERM IN STATE'S PRISON
6829-68769-0044 IT IS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS AN ANNOYANCE
6829-68769-0045 I'LL PAY ALL THE COSTS MYSELF
6829-68769-0046 YE'RE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS
6829-68769-0047 I HAVE MY OWN OPINIONS MISTER MARSHALL
6829-68769-0048 GIVE ME A CHEQUE FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGED CHECK AND CASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
6829-68769-0049 HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION WHICH WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATES
6829-68769-0050 BETH UNEASY AT THEIR SILENCE NUDGED HIM
6829-68769-0051 THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SWEET FACE
6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHECK IN THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
6829-68769-0053 AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY A PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
6829-68771-0000 SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE SYMPATHETIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORD'S AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
6829-68771-0001 ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMEN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVASS OF THE VOTES OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
6829-68771-0002 THE WEAK LEAD CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM OPPOSITION
6829-68771-0003 THIS DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS
6829-68771-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS REYNOLDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PREPARED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPKINS
6829-68771-0005 THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH REYNOLDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGEMENT PERSONALLY
6829-68771-0006 AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN HER BUGGY
6829-68771-0007 THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHILE THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
6829-68771-0008 THOSE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN ELECTING MISTER FORBES
6829-68771-0009 LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENTS TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
6829-68771-0010 THE FAIRVIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUEST
6829-68771-0011 TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY OR SUBSTANTIAL REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED
6829-68771-0012 THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN IN ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESTS
6829-68771-0013 THE ATTENDANCE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FORESEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR PLAN
6829-68771-0014 I OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTENDANCE BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN
6829-68771-0015 WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSES AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS
6829-68771-0016 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHILE AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER ESPECIAL FAVOURITE
6829-68771-0017 THE HUNTER LED THE WAY AND BETH FOLLOWED
6829-68771-0018 FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND A SLIGHT SMILE UPON THE BEAUTIFUL FACE
6829-68771-0019 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST A PLAIN BLACK GOWN WITH A WIDE APRON AND CAP
6829-68771-0020 SHE GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I'M ELIZABETH PARSON'S
6829-68771-0021 BUT IT CAN'T BE YOU PROTESTED THE GIRL
6829-68771-0022 I ATTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD MENDING YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR MY LINEN
6829-68771-0023 YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE IS THEIR HOME
6829-68771-0024 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER PRISONER
6829-68771-0025 SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROCKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SIGHED BETH
6829-68771-0026 ELIZA PARSONS SHOOK THE HEAD
6829-68771-0027 BUT THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
6829-68771-0028 SHE EVEN FELT MILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED
6829-68771-0029 BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELIZA SURPASSED HER IN NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACTS
6829-68771-0030 HER MANNER WAS NEVER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
6829-68771-0031 HER EYES WANDERED TO HER MAID'S HANDS
6829-68771-0032 HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORM MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE WORDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
6829-68771-0033 SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH A BREATH
6829-68771-0034 I WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE ASKED FIERCELY
6829-68771-0035 WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM AND MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU
6829-68771-0036 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN HER LOCK
6930-75918-0000 CONCORD RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TORRENTS
6930-75918-0001 THE ENGLISH FOITED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
6930-75918-0002 CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS EVERYBODY DURING HER JOURNEY
6930-75918-0003 FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER UPON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UNHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCE
6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPEN FOR THEM
6930-75918-0005 THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF A TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN A HARASSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS WIFE
6930-75918-0007 YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS HAVE
6930-75918-0008 CAN YOU IMAGINE WHY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO WILD I SUSPECT
6930-75918-0009 IT IS YOU WHO ARE MISTAKEN RAOUL I HAVE READ HIS DISTRUST IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
6930-75918-0010 I CAN RECEIVE LOVE CLEARLY ENOUGH
6930-75918-0011 I AM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE COLONEL
6930-75918-0012 IT IS ANNOYANCE AGAIN
6930-75918-0013 IN THOSE VERY PARTS I EVEN ADDED MORE
6930-75918-0014 BUT CONTINUED RAOUL NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AND INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN WERE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
6930-75918-0015 THUS IT IS THAT THE ONE OF THREE IS SAVED OUR COUNTRY OUR MASTERS AND OUR OWN
6930-75918-0016 YES I NEEDED REPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
6930-75918-0017 BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE RAUS COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT
6930-75918-0018 THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLIT AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYBODY
6930-75918-0019 UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY A GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGSTONES
6930-75918-0020 BRAGELONNE WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVIL SLUMBERS OF MANI KEMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET
6930-76324-0000 GOLIATH MAKES ANOTHER DESCRIPTION
6930-76324-0001 THEY WERE CERTAINLY NOT NEARER THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM
6930-76324-0002 THE POOR LITTLE THINGS CRIES CYNTHIA THINK OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS
6930-76324-0003 NOW THAT IS THE SENSE OF IT TWO INNOCENT BABIES LIKE THAT
6930-76324-0004 BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT DOWN HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACED HER
6930-76324-0005 THE TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED A PICTURE TO THE WALL
6930-76324-0006 HERS HAPPENED TO BE ON THAT SAME FRAME TOO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT
6930-76324-0007 AND WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHIA SPRAGUE
6930-76324-0008 I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMPED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THE PICTURE BUT IT HAS BEEN OF SOME USE AFTER ALL
6930-76324-0009 DO YOU BELIEVE THE MINIATURE WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING
6930-76324-0010 WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT QUERIED GEORGE
6930-76324-0011 YOU WORRY ME TERRIBLY AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEMES SIN
6930-76324-0012 WE'LL COME ON HERE THIS AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOTHES ON AND HAVE A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING
6930-76324-0013 IT CAN'T HURT ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR THEY WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL
6930-76324-0014 THIS FACT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PAIR
6930-76324-0015 SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PARAPHERNALIA THROUGH THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUST PAN TO THE OUTFIT
6930-76324-0016 THE LURE PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A YOUNG KITTEN TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
6930-76324-0017 OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE URGED I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM AROUND THAT OLD HOUSE
6930-76324-0018 WHO MAKES IT SORT OF COSIER
6930-76324-0019 NOW LET'S DUST OUR FURNITURE AND PICTURES
6930-76324-0020 THEN LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM
6930-76324-0021 SURFACE DUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS TRUE ELEGANCE AND POLISH
6930-76324-0022 NOW SHE SUDDENLY REMARKED
6930-76324-0023 AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN BUT YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL
6930-76324-0024 THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLE LIGHT IS THE PRETTIEST IN A WORLD
6930-76324-0025 WHY IT'S GOLIATH AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING INTO
6930-76324-0026 ISN'T HE THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO ODDS
6930-76324-0027 FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND SCURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON OCCASIONS PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER
6930-76324-0028 WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
6930-81414-0000 NO WORDS ARE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY
6930-81414-0001 I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW KAFFIR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT OVER HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
6930-81414-0002 ONWARD A DISTANT VOICE
6930-81414-0003 NO SOUND BREAK THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
6930-81414-0004 THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
6930-81414-0005 WHAT HAS THAT
6930-81414-0006 WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE PAN
6930-81414-0007 NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN A WRIST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
6930-81414-0008 I DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
6930-81414-0009 I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WERE FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS KAFIR
6930-81414-0010 A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LAUGHTER
6930-81414-0011 A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS WAKE WHERE
6930-81414-0012 SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNISED AS VOLTAIRE'S KAVIR
6930-81414-0013 I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO HIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
6930-81414-0014 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALMOST DISCOLOURED
6930-81414-0015 I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAZED BEWILDERED AND
6930-81414-0016 BUT THAT IS KATHIR'S KNIFE
6930-81414-0017 I SAY HE HAD IT THIS VERY EVENING
6930-81414-0018 I REMEMBERED SAYING HAS WE BEEN TOGETHER
6930-81414-0019 VOLTAIRE PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT HIM
6930-81414-0020 I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL ME
6930-81414-0021 A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MINE MIND
6930-81414-0022 I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCES OF THIS MAN'S POWER
6930-81414-0023 PERCHANCE TOO KATIR'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
6930-81414-0024 MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY MANNER OF SPEECH LEFT ME
6930-81414-0025 MY POSITION WAS TOO TEMPORARY
6930-81414-0026 MY OVERWROUGHT NERVES EXHAUSTED AT LAST
6930-81414-0027 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCT
7021-79730-0000 THOSE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT
7021-79730-0001 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE THE NATURE AND DESIGN
7021-79730-0002 TO REASON AND AFFECTION
7021-79730-0003 AS THE CHAISE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE MASTER DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT AND VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SURGE AND SWELL ALONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY
7021-79730-0004 THE MOTHER AS SOON AS A CHAISE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE
7021-79730-0005 SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NEVER MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
7021-79730-0006 THE MOTHER AND MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
7021-79730-0007 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNLESS WE ARE GONE
7021-79730-0008 BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNEXPECTED FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
7021-79730-0009 IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION WILL NOT BE OVERRATED
7021-79740-0000 TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT METHODS OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
7021-79740-0001 DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME IS JANE
7021-79740-0002 NOW DELIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDENCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THE DOLLS
7021-79740-0003 TO GIVE A IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
7021-79740-0004 YOU HAVE COME ASELLA AND DELLA WAS THE NAME OF JANE'S DOLL TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT
7021-79740-0005 I AM VERY GRAND
7021-79740-0006 I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL AND'ELLA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
7021-79740-0007 THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE IS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
7021-79740-0008 FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSES LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
7021-79740-0009 THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PORCH
7021-79740-0010 DELIA CAME TO THE PARLOUR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSALIE HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO HIM
7021-79740-0011 SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY UPON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE
7021-79740-0012 SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHING I SEE
7021-79740-0013 PUT THESE PLAYTHINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND YOU WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
7021-79740-0014 AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT FOR ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
7021-79759-0000 NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSION
7021-79759-0001 THAT'S COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
7021-79759-0002 THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM FRAGMENTS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
7021-79759-0003 FAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
7021-79759-0004 WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONVENTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND
7021-79759-0005 THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUGGESTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
7021-85628-0000 BUT ANDERS CAREED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
7021-85628-0001 HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NO BODY BUT ANDERS
7021-85628-0002 HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY BUT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKKNIFE
7021-85628-0003 NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND BUTERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKKNIFE
7021-85628-0004 YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDRESS
7021-85628-0005 SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE QUEEN
7021-85628-0006 I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDES
7021-85628-0007 AND SHE TOOK ANDER'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHERE EVER HE WENT
7021-85628-0008 FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
7021-85628-0009 AT THE FARTHER END IN THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS
7021-85628-0010 THE HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
7021-85628-0011 THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET AND SET IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
7021-85628-0012 BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP IN YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF
7021-85628-0013 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP IN ANY CONDITION
7021-85628-0014 HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HAIR
7021-85628-0015 WELL AND NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN ROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
7021-85628-0016 THAT WAS A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID
7021-85628-0017 SO IT IS SAID WALTERS
7021-85628-0018 THEN IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
7021-85628-0019 WITH ONE JUMP ASERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
7021-85628-0020 THEY DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
7021-85628-0021 HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS WE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
7021-85628-0022 AND ALL ITS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
7021-85628-0023 BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GET HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID
7021-85628-0024 AND HE'S FACE GREW RED
7021-85628-0025 BUT THIS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE
7021-85628-0026 NO MY LITTLE SON SHE SAYS
7021-85628-0027 IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY WISER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
7127-75946-0000 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS ARE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT
7127-75946-0001 AH VERY
7127-75946-0002 LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AU COURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAS PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
7127-75946-0003 GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT ANGNON AND VILLAROIS TOOK THEIR LEAVE
7127-75946-0004 CERTAINLY SIRE AND I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHAT
7127-75946-0005 WHAT DO YOU MEAN RETURNED LOUISE
7127-75946-0006 HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE TO THE PRESENT MOMENT
7127-75946-0007 IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE PRINCE FROWNED
7127-75946-0008 DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BEAR THE DISLOYAL ATTEMPT
7127-75946-0009 NOT AT ALL YOU'RE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME
7127-75946-0010 MY MAJESTY'S PLAN THEN IN THIS AFFAIR IS
7127-75946-0011 YOU SHALL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
7127-75946-0012 THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING THIS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF COQUETRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
7127-75946-0013 THE COUNT HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILET BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
7127-75946-0014 THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT DAIS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATRE OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE AND CONSTRUCTION
7127-75946-0015 SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PEACE AND ORDER SPRING ACCOMPANIED WITH HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
7127-75946-0016 THE SEASONS ALLIES THE SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUADRILLE WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DANCE
7127-75946-0017 HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLOURED SILKEN HOSE OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMS ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
7127-75946-0018 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BUOYANT MOVEMENTS OF AN ADMIRAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEM TO SOAR ALONG
7127-75946-0019 YES IT HAS SUPPRESSED
7127-75946-0020 FAR FROM IT SIRE OUR MAJESTY HAVING GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINED IT
7127-75946-0021 YES SIRE AN READY DRESSED FOR THE BALLET
7127-75946-0022 SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH ZEAL THAT HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
7127-75946-0023 THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY THING PRESENT
7127-75946-0024 MONSIEUR WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
7127-75946-0025 THE BALLET BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN USUAL
7127-75946-0026 WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL UPON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATRE SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
7127-75946-0027 DISDAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKED PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCE
7127-75946-0028 BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE STUPEFIED
7127-75946-0029 THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN THE QUADRILLE CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVALS
7127-75947-0000 EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BEDAMMED
7127-75947-0001 UPON THIS LADY DEIGNED TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE COMTE OBSERVING
7127-75947-0002 DO YOU THINK SHE REPLIED WITH INDIFFERENCE
7127-75947-0003 YES THE CHARACTER WHICH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS ASSUMED IS IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH MY OWN
7127-75947-0004 EXCUSE YOURSELF
7127-75947-0005 I ALLUDES TO THE GODDESS
7127-75947-0006 THE COUNTESS INQUIRED NO
7127-75947-0007 SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR TO WHICH HE WAS PRESENTLY GOING TO DANCE
7127-75947-0008 THE ARROW PIERCED HIS HEAD AND WOUNDED HIM MORTALLY
7127-75947-0009 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO THE THEATER BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART
7127-75947-0010 WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISED IN THE MIDST OF IDEAS SHE WAS DESIROUS OF CONCEALING TO HERSELF
7127-75947-0011 REMAIN I IMPLORE YOU THE EVENING'S MOST LOVELY
7127-75947-0012 INDEED ACH

7127-75947-0015 THERE CANNOT BE A DOUBT HE RECEIVED YOU KINDLY FOR IN FACT WE RETURNED WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION
7127-75947-0016 OH MADEMOISELLE WHY HAVE I NOT A DEVOTED SISTER OR A TRUE FRIEND SUCH AS HERSELF
7127-75947-0017 WHAT ALREADY HERE THEY SAID TO HIM

7127-75947-0022 I AM A WOMAN AND THERE ARE FEW LIKE ME WHOEVER LOVES ME FLATTERS ME WHOEVER FLATTERS ME PLEASES ME AND WHOEVER CHOOSES WELL SAID MONTALAIS YOU DO NOT FINISH
7127-75947-0023 IT IS TOO DIFFICULT REPLIED MADEMOISELLE DE TOURNAY CHARMONT LAUGHING LOUDLY
7127-75947-0024 LOOK YONDER DO YE NOT SEE THE MOON SLOWLY RISING SILVERING THE TOPMOST BRANCHES OF THE CHESTNUTS AND THE OAKS
7127-75947-0025 EXQUISITE SOFT TURF OF THE ROCKS THE HAPPINESS WHICH YOUR FRIENDSHIP CONFERS UPON ME
7127-75947-0026 WELL SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TOURNAY CHARANT I ALSO THINK A GOOD DEAL BUT I TAKE CARE
7127-75947-0027 TO SAY NOTHING SAID MONTALAIS SO THAT WHEN MADEMOISELLE DE TONAY CHARANT THINKS ATHENA IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS IT
7127-75947-0028 QUICK QUICK THEN FROM THE HIGH REED GRASS SAID MONTALAIS STOOP ATHENE YOU ARE SO TALL
7127-75947-0029 THE YOUNG GIRLS HAD INDEED MADE THEMSELVES SMALL INDEED IN
7127-75947-0030 SHE WAS HERE JEST NOW SAID THE COUNT
7127-75947-0031 YOU ARE POSITIVE AGAIN
7127-75947-0032 YES BUT PERHAPS HE FRIGHTENED HER IN WHAT WAY
7127-75947-0033 HOW IS IT LA VALLIERE SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TOURNICHARANT THAT THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE SPOKE OF YOU AS LOUISE
7127-75947-0034 IT SEEMS THE KINGS WILL NOT CONSENT TO IT
7127-75947-0035 GOOD GRACIOUS HAS THE KING A RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN MATTERS OF THAT KIND
7127-75947-0036 I GIVES MY CONSENT
7127-75947-0037 WELL I AM SPEAKING SERIOUSLY REPLIED MONTALAIS AND MY OPINION IN THIS CASE IS QUITE AS GOOD AS THE KING'S I SUPPOSE IS IT NOT LOUISE
7127-75947-0038 LET US RUN THEN SAID ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR SILK DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE THICKEST COVER OF THE PARK
7127-75947-0039 IN FACT THE SOUND OF MESDAM AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTAIN CAVALIERS
7127-75947-0040 IN THIS WAY THE FETE OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FETE ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER IN THE BRAKE THE PHEASANT ON THE BRANCHES THE FOX IN ITS HOLE WERE ALL LISTENING
7176-88083-0000 ALL ABOUT THEM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOUR SCATTERED IN BROAD SPLASHES
7176-88083-0001 THE MURGANCER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF IRIDESCENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PENCILLED IN BLACK AND WHITE AND BREAST OF RICH CHESTNUT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK
7176-88083-0002 HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW TOOTHED EDGES AND SHORT HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
7176-88083-0003 BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS OR EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS
7176-88083-0004 BUT FINALLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMORANT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0005 ONCE MERELY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PERCH
7176-88083-0006 IT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
7176-88083-0007 BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS ENGORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD TO THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY
7176-88083-0008 IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD SO SOON
7176-88083-0009 THE GREAT HULK CALLED HURRIEDLY TO RETRIEVE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND
7176-88083-0010 THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE IN HIS JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT
7176-88083-0011 IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRAINED GULLET WHEN THE BAFFLED HOOK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
7176-88083-0012 THE HAWKS ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED
7176-88083-0013 LIKE HIS WONDERFUL LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
7176-88083-0014 THE HAWK SAT UP UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0015 ALMOST SUDDENLY HE WAS FORCED TO THE TOP
7176-88083-0016 STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK GLIDED FROM HER PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM
7176-88083-0017 BUT AT THIS POINT IN A RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
7176-88083-0018 BUT THE FREQUENTER OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
7176-88083-0019 AS HE FLEW HIS TAIL REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD
7176-88083-0020 BEFORE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH
7176-88083-0021 BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOW OVER HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
7176-88083-0022 THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BEEN AS DOGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED
7176-88083-0023 HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CASTE BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DRAW HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING
7176-88083-0024 THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT GOT JUST AT THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY
7176-88083-0025 AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANKS
7176-88083-0026 THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LAST CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING
7176-88083-0027 THEN THE LADDER PARTED FROM THE LINE
7176-92135-0000 HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO A SYMPOSIUM OF THE PRICE OF GOLF BALLS
7176-92135-0001 IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY CAN SAY SO
7176-92135-0002 BUT THEN THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMATIST HAS HIS MOMENTS
7176-92135-0003 YOUR PLAY SHOULD BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE
7176-92135-0004 FRANKLY I CANNOT ALWAYS SPEAK
7176-92135-0005 BUT SUPPOSE YOU SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME WERE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH
7176-92135-0006 I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I'VE BETTER KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
7176-92135-0007 ANYHOW IT'S JOLLY EXCITING AND I CAN DO THE DIALOGUEAL RIGHT
7176-92135-0008 LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGE THAT IS
7176-92135-0009 AND WE SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HOMILY ON SOLILOQUY
7176-92135-0010 HIM TOO BE OR NOT TO BE
7176-92135-0011 NOW THE OBJECT OF THIS SOLILOQUY IS PAIN
7176-92135-0012 INDEED IRRESOLUTION BEING THE KEYNOTE OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADE OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEANING
7176-92135-0013 WE MODERNS HARDLY SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT
7176-92135-0014 IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STATES TECHNIQUE HOW SHALL A SOLILOQUY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY
7176-92135-0015 AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN OPHELIA MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NONCOMMITTAL OF THIS SORT
7176-92135-0016 IT WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF
7176-92135-0017 IN THE OTHER BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE
7176-92135-0018 IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS HER WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL
7176-92135-0019 I WANT DOUBLE MINE HELLO
7176-92135-0020 DOUBLE O NINE TWO THREE ELSINOR DOUBLE NOT YES HELLO IS THAT YOU HORATIO HAMLET SPEAKING
7176-92135-0021 I SAY I'M BEEN WONDERING ABOUT THIS BUSINESS
7176-92135-0022 TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER TIS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO SUFFER THE SLINGS AND ARROWS WHAT A HAMLET SPEAKING
7176-92135-0023 YOU GAVE ME DOUBLE FIVE I WANT TO DOUBLE NINE HELLO IS THAT YOU HORATIO HAMLET SPEAKING
7176-92135-0024 TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER TIS SIMPLER
7176-92135-0025 IT IS TO LET HAMLET IF THAT HAPPEN TO BE THE NAME OF YOUR CHARACTER ENTER WITH A SMALL DOG PET FALCON MONGOOSE TAME BEAR OR WHATEVER ANIMAL IS MOST IN KEEPING WITH A PART AND CONFIDE IN THIS ANIMAL SUCH SORROWS HOPES OR SECRET HISTORY AS THE AUDIENCE HAS GOT TO KNOW
7176-92135-0026 ENTER HAMLET WITH THIS FAVOURITE BOARHOUND
7176-92135-0027 LADY LARKSMORE STARTS SUDDENLY AND TURNS TOWARD HIM
7176-92135-0028 LARKSPUR BIT ME AGAIN THIS TIME FOR THE THIRD TIME
7176-92135-0029 I WANT TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL I SWOON
7176-92135-0030 ENTER LORD ARTHUR FLUFFANO'
7176-92135-0031 AND THERE YOU ARE YOU WOULD OF COURSE APPRECIATE THAT THE UNFINISHED SENTENCES NOT ONLY SAVE TIME BUT ALSO MAKE THE MANOEUVRING VERY MUCH MORE NATURAL
7176-92135-0032 HOW YOU MAY BE WONDERING ARE YOU TO BEGIN YOUR MASTERSHIP
7176-92135-0033 RELAPSES INTO SILENCE FOR THE REST OF EVENING
7176-92135-0034 THE DUCHESS OF SURBRIDGE TO LORD REGGIE OH REGGIE WHAT DID YOU SAY
7176-92135-0035 THEN LORD TUPPINY WELL WHAT ABOUT AUCTION
7176-92135-0036 THE CROWD DRIFTS OUT LEAVING THE HERO AND HEROINE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE AND THEN YOU CAN BEGIN
7176-92135-0037 THEN IS THE TIME TO INTRODUCE A MEAL UPON THE STAGE
7176-92135-0038 A STAGE MEAL IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVES TO THE AUDIENCE THAT THE ACTORS EVEN WHEN CALLED CHARLES HOLTREE OR OWEN NAYIRS ARE REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME
7176-92135-0039 TI PLEASE MATTHEWS BUTLER IMPASSIVELY
7176-92135-0040 HOSTESS REPLACES LUMP AND INCLINES EMPTY TEAPOT OVER TRAY FOR A MOMENT THEN HANDS HIM A CUP PAINTED ROUND INSIDE THUS DECEIVING THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE TELESCOPE IN THE UPPER CIRCLE
7176-92135-0041 RE ENTER BUTLER AND THREE FOOTMEN WHO REMOVED THE TEA THINGS HOSTESS TO GUESTS
7176-92135-0042 IN NOVELS THE HERO HAS OFTEN PUSHED HIS MEALS AWAY UNTASTED BUT NO DEED HERO WOULD DO ANYTHING SO UNNATURAL AS THIS
7176-92135-0043 TWO BITES ARE MADE AND THE BREAD IS CRUMBLED WITH AN AIR OF GREAT EAGERNESS INDEED ONE FEELS THAT IN REAL LIFE THE GUEST WOULD CLUTCH HOLD OF THE FOOTMEN AND SAY HALF AN OLD CHAP I HAVEN'T NEARLY FINISHED BUT THE ACTOR IS BETTER SCHOOLED THAN THIS
7176-92135-0044 BUT IT WAS THE CIGARETTE WHICH CHIEFLY HAS BROUGHT THE MODERN DRAMA TO ITS PRESENT STATE OF PERFECTION
7176-92135-0045 LADY JOHN TAKING OUT GOLD CIGARETTE CASE FROM HIS LEFT HAND UPPER WAISTCOAT POCKET
7729-102255-0000 THAT BOGUS LEGISLATURE NUMBERED THIRTY SIX MEMBERS
7729-102255-0001 THIS WAS AT THE MARCH ELECTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR
7729-102255-0002 THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE THREE STATES GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES
7729-102255-0003 FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATELINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN THE SCALE
7729-102255-0004 THE FREE STATE MEN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEIR COURAGE AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD ITS SECRET COMBINATION THE TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS THE LEGISLATURE THE BOGUS LAWS THE COURTS THE MILITIA OFFICERS THE PRESIDENT AND THE ENEMY
7729-102255-0005 THIS WAS A FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF ADVANTAGES SLAVERY WAS PLAYING WITH LOADING DICE
7729-102255-0006 COMING BY WAY OF THE MISSOURI RIVER TOWNS HE FELL FIRST AMONG BORDER RUFFIAN COMPANIONSHIP AND INFLUENCES AND PERHAPS HAVING HIS INCLINATIONS ALREADY MOLDED BY HIS WASHINGTON INSTRUCTIONS HIS EARLY IMPRESSIONS WERE DECIDEDLY ADVERSE TO THE FREE STATE CAUSES
7729-102255-0007 HIS RECEPTION SPEECH AT WESTPORT IN WHICH HE MAINTAINED THE LEGALITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND HIS DETERMINATION TO ENFORCE THEIR LAWS DELIGHTED HIS PRO SLAVERY AUDITOR
7729-102255-0008 ALL THE TERRITORIAL DIGNITARIES WERE PRESENT GOVERNOR SHANNON PRESIDED JOHN CALHOUN THE SURVEYOR GENERAL MADE THE PRINCIPAL SPEECH A DENUNCIATION OF THE ABOLITIONIST SUPPORTING THE TOPEKA MOVEMENT CHIEF JUSTICE LEE COMTE DIGNIFIED THE OCCASION WITH APPROVING REMARKS
7729-102255-0009 ALL DISSENT ALL NON COMPLIANCE ALL HESITATION ALL MERE SILENCE EVEN WERE IN THEIR STRONGHOLD TOWNS LIKE LEVINWORTH BRANDED AS ABOLITIONISM DECLARED TO BE HOSTILITY TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND PUNISHED WITH PROSCRIPTION PERSONAL VIOLENCE EXPULSION AND FREQUENTLY DEATH
7729-102255-0010 OF THE LYNCHINGS THE MOBS AND THEIR MURDERS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE EXCEPT IN A VERY EXTENDED WORK TO NOTE THE FREQUENT AND ATROCIOUS DETAILS
7729-102255-0011 THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH UPON THE MORE SALIENT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN KANSAS WHICH HAPPILY ARE NOT SANGUINARY IF HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE ISOLATED CASES OF BLOODSHED COULD BE DISCOVERED THEY WOULD SHOW A STARTLING AGGREGATE OF BARBARITY AND A LOSS OF LIFE FOR OPINION'S SAKE
7729-102255-0012 SEVERAL HUNDRED FREE STATED MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
7729-102255-0013 IT WAS IN FACT THE BEST WEAPON OF OUR DAY
7729-102255-0014 THE LEADER OF THE CONSPIRACY BECAME DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN
7729-102255-0015 ONE OF HIS MILITIA GENERALS SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR SHOULD REQUIRE THE OUTLAWS AT LAWRENCE AND ELSEWHERE TO SURRENDER A SHARP'S RIFLES ANOTHER WROTE ASKING HIM TO CALL OUT THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS AT FORT LEAVENWORTH
7729-102255-0016 THE GOVERNOR ON HIS SIDE BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF THE LEGALITY OF EMPLOYING MISSOURI MILITIA TO ENFORCE KANSAS LAWS WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HELP OF FEDERAL TROOPS
7729-102255-0017 SHERIFF JONES HAD HIS POCKETS ALWAYS FULL OF WRITS ISSUED IN THE SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION BUT WAS OFTEN BAFFLED BY THE SHARP WITS AND READY RESOURCES OF THE FREE STATE PEOPLES AND SOMETIMES DEFIED OUTRIGHT
7729-102255-0018 LITTLE BY LITTLE HOWEVER THE FATHER BECAME HEMMED AND BOUND IN THE MESHES OF THE VARIOUS DEVICES AND PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS EVOLVED FROM THE BOGUS LAWS
7729-102255-0019 TO EMBARRASS THIS DAMAGING EXPOSURE JUDGE LE COMTE ISSUED A WRIT AGAINST THE EX GOVERNOR AND A FRIVOLOUS CHARGE OF CONTEMPT
7729-102255-0020 THE INCIDENT WAS NOT VIOLENT NOR EVEN DRAMATIC NO POSSE WAS SUMMONED NO FURTHER EFFORT MADE AND NOBODY FEARING PERSONAL VIOLENCE SOON FLED IN DISGUISE
7729-102255-0021 BUT THE AFFAIR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE THREE STATE MEN WERE INSURRECTIONISTS AND OUTLAWS
7729-102255-0022 FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICADED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMPS AND SCOUT PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GOERRILLA BANDS HALF PARTISAN HALF PREDATORY
7729-102255-0023 THEIR DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS HOWEVER DISPLAY ONE BROAD AND UNFAILING FEATURES
7729-102255-0024 THE FREE STATE MEN CLUNG TO THEIR PRAIRIE TOWNS AND PRAIRIE RAVINES WITH ALL THE OBSTINACY AND COURAGE OF TRUTH DEFENDERS OF THEIR HOMES AND FIRESIDES
7729-102255-0025 THEIR ASSUMED CHARACTER JOINED WITH THEIR CHANGING OPPORTUNITIES OR NECESSITIES
7729-102255-0026 IN THE SHOOTING OF SHERIFF JONES IN LAWRENCE AND IN THE REFUSAL OF EX GOVERNOR EDWARD TO ALLOW THE DEPUTY MARSHAL TO ARREST HIM THEY DISCOVERED GRAVE OFFENCES AGAINST THE TERRITORIAL AND THE UNITED STATES LAWS
7729-102255-0027 FOOTNOTE SUMNER TO SHANNON MAY TWELFTH EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN SIX
7729-102255-0028 PRIVATE PERSONS WHO HAD LEASED THE FREE STATE HOTEL VAINLY BESOUGHT THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES TO CONSIDER THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR PROPERTY
7729-102255-0029 NINE DAYS WERE CONSUMED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE REFUSED TO YIELD
7729-102255-0030 HE SUMMONED HALF A DOZEN CITIZENS TO JOIN HIS POSSE WHO FOLLOWED OBEYED AND ARRESTED HIM
7729-102255-0031 HE CONTINUED HIS PRETENDED SEARCH AND TO GIVE COLOUR TO HIS ERRAND MADE TO REST
7729-102255-0032 THE FREE STATE HOTEL A STONE BUILDING IN DIMENSIONS SIXTY BY SEVENTY FEET THREE STOREYS HIGH AND HANDSOMELY FURNISHED PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED ONLY FOR LODGING ROOMS ON THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME OPENED ITS TABLE ACCOMMODATIONS TO THE PUBLIC AND PROVIDED A FREE DINNER IN HONOR OF THE OCCASION
7729-102255-0033 AS HE HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE BOAT THE REASSURED CITIZENS BEGAN TO LAUGH AT THEIR OWN FEARS
7729-102255-0034 TO THEIR SORROW THEY WERE UNDECEIVED
7729-102255-0035 THE MILITARY FORCE PARTLY RABBLE PARTLY ORGANIZE HAD MEANWHILE MOVED INTO THE TOWN
7729-102255-0036 HE PLANTED A COMPANY BEFORE THE HOTEL AND DEMANDED A SURRENDER OF THE HANDS BELONGING TO THE FREE STATE MILITARY COMPANIES
7729-102255-0037 HALF AN HOUR LATER TURNING A DEAF EAR TO ALL REMONSTRANCE HE ASKED THE PROPRIETORS UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK TO REMOVE THEIR FAMILIES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE FREE STATE HOTEL
7729-102255-0038 ICHESON WHO HAD BEEN HARANGUING THE MOB PLANTED HIS TWO GUNS BEFORE THE BUILDING AND TRAINED THEM UPON IT
7729-102255-0039 THEIR INMATES BEING REMOVED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR A FEW CANNON BALLS WERE FIRED THROUGH THE STONE WALLS
7729-102255-0040 IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATIVE AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSETTS FINDS ITS MOST REASONABLE AND TRIUMPHANT VINDICATION
7729-102255-0041 THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOT SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISGUST AT THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND ACCESSORIES
7729-102255-0042 RELOCATED FOOTNOTE COLONEL ROBINSON BEING ON HIS WAY EAST THE STEAMBOAT ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELLING STOPPED AT LEXINGTON MISSOURI
7729-102255-0043 IN A FEW DAYS AN OFFICER CAME WITH A REQUISITION FROM GOVERNOR SHANNON AND TOOK THE PRISONER BY LAND AT WESTPORT AND AFTERWARD FROM THERE TO KANSAS CITY AND LEAVENWORTH
7729-102255-0044 HERE HE WAS PLACED IN THE CUSTODY OF CAPTAIN MARTIN OF THE KICKAPOO RANGERS WHO PROVED A KIND JAILER AND MATERIALLY ASSISTED IN PROTECTING HIM FROM THE DANGEROUS INTENTIONS OF THE MOB WHICH AT THE TIME HELD LEAVENWORTH UNDER THE REIGN OF TERROR
7729-102255-0045 CAPTAIN MARTIN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORST COMES TO THE WORST
7729-102255-0046 IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINTH A COMPANY OF DRAGOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PRO SLAVERY MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIES TO LE COMPTEN IN THE CHARGE OF OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY
8224-274381-0000 THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THE ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS
8224-274381-0001 AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF MURCHESDEN SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED
8224-274381-0002 WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS ENTITLED
8224-274381-0003 THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPENED TO MONTROSE'S COUNCILS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE IN SCOTLAND
8224-274381-0004 FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELKIE WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION
8224-274381-0005 DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLL WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLEY AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0006 THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ATTACK HIM
8224-274381-0007 BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS BUT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0008 WITH THESE AND SOME REINFORCEMENT OF THE ATHOL MEN AND MACDONALDS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD
8224-274381-0009 THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INNERLOCCO SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM
8224-274381-0010 BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNERLOI AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTED COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0011 HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED RIDICULOUS
8224-274381-0012 MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF ROYALISTS
8224-274381-0013 FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENT COULD RELY ON
8224-274381-0014 BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMANDS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
8224-274381-0015 THO THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS
8224-274381-0016 VALOUR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMED STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN GREAT MEASURE WANTING
8224-274381-0017 HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANYTHING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO THE BATTLE WHERE VALOR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINE THE SUCCESS
8224-274384-0000 SHE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILL
8224-274384-0001 THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS EFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOUR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
8224-274384-0002 THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURE THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING
8224-274384-0003 OR HATH HE GIVEN US EVERY GIFT
8224-274384-0004 AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE COME PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
8224-274384-0005 ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG AGAIN
8224-274384-0006 THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FROM THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
8224-274384-0007 HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR THEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
8224-274384-0008 THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FARMER HAD CALLED FOR
8224-274384-0009 THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE QUEEN
8224-274384-0010 BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE PRODUCED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
8224-274384-0011 THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHEN THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS
8224-274384-0012 IF ANY STILL MAINTAINED RANCOUR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY
8224-274384-0013 HER DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
8230-279154-0000 THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE FOURTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
8230-279154-0001 WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES OR EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
8230-279154-0002 WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MUST SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
8230-279154-0003 AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCES LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
8230-279154-0004 THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST
8230-279154-0005 ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE SOME LOGICAL TUNABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
8230-279154-0006 THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORDS
8230-279154-0007 HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIORIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN HE ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
8230-279154-0008 YET I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE IS WARRANTED
8230-279154-0009 OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF THE MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
8230-279154-0010 WE SOMETIMES HAVE EMOTIONS THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
8230-279154-0011 SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS SEEM VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE
8230-279154-0012 AND FAMILIARITY IS A FEELING CAPABLE OF DEGREES
8230-279154-0013 IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PERSONS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS
8230-279154-0014 I COME NOW TO THE THIRD CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0015 THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS IN THE PAST
8230-279154-0016 IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN A REMEMBERED EVENT
8230-279154-0017 THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATELY MEMORY IS CONCERNED
8230-279154-0018 THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME THE ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0019 IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE LOOKED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0020 IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN LANGUAGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
8230-279154-0021 REMEMBER IT HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
8230-279154-0022 SOME POINTS MAY BE GIVEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
8230-279154-0023 IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN FRANCE IS RATHER VAGUE
8230-279154-0024 THE FIRST OF THEIR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0025 WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMEDIE
8230-279154-0026 THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW AND THEORY
8230-279154-0027 A GRAMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MUST RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
8230-279154-0028 I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT WHICH ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
8230-279154-0029 THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR WRITTEN IT
8230-279154-0030 SIMMONDS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH THE KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
8230-279154-0031 THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST ASSURANCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
8230-279154-0032 IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF MARRIAGE
8230-279154-0033 IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THIS IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
8230-279154-0034 WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITH A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGEMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
8230-279154-0035 THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THEIR FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
8230-279154-0036 A FURTHER STAGE IS THE RECOGNITION
8230-279154-0037 RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNISE IN THE CAT OF A MOMENT
8230-279154-0038 WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNISE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS ADJUSTMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
8230-279154-0039 THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEANING IN ONE SENSE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
8230-279154-0040 THERE IS HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
8230-279154-0041 THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS NOTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
8230-279154-0042 THUS IF I RECOGNISE A THING THE RELATION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNISE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
8230-279154-0043 OF COURSE THE WORDS AS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION
8455-210777-0000 I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS FOR I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT
8455-210777-0001 HAD EVA CRUSWELLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINGTON OVAL REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BUNNETT AND THE BARKEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND
8455-210777-0002 ON ARRIVING AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND OUR SALON WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY
8455-210777-0003 AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A CURIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
8455-210777-0004 I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS DISTANT PORTION OF THE WORLD
8455-210777-0005 WE HAVE OUR LITTLE STRUGGLES HERE AS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WATER
8455-210777-0006 WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN BADAX SAID MY WIFE
8455-210777-0007 QUITE SATISFIED SAID EDWARD
8455-210777-0008 THE LADIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HEART WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC ARE ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MANAGED ARE UPON THE OTHER
8455-210777-0009 NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE SOLDIERS WILL FOLLOW
8455-210777-0010 THEIR MASTERS SAY MISSUS NEVERBEND
8455-210777-0011 I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN DOLAX TO TOUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
8455-210777-0012 MISSUS NEVERBEND YOU MUST INDEED BE FOND OF YOUR SON
8455-210777-0013 JACK HAD BEEN SITTING IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVA AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES
8455-210777-0014 SIR KENNINGTON OVAL WAS A VERY FINE PLAYER SAID MY WIFE
8455-210777-0015 I AND MY WIFE AND SON AND THE TWO CRESWELLERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINE ON BOARD THE SHIP IN THE NEXT
8455-210777-0016 THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVOURED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BEFIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT NOTHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
8455-210777-0017 MY WIFE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT PROMISED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMAN A VERY GOOD DINNER
8455-210777-0018 THIS SHE SAID WITH TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I DID NOT AGREE WITH HER
8455-210777-0019 THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMPANY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
8455-210777-0020 OH YES SAID JACK WHEN I'M NOWHERE
8455-210777-0021 THAT I MEAN TO HAVE MY INNINGS BEFORE LONG
8455-210777-0022 OF WHAT MISSUS NEVERBEND HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JELLIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT HIMSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROUGH SUCCESS
8455-210777-0023 WE SAT WITH THE MASTER SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT ASHORE
8455-210777-0024 HOW MUCH OF EVIL A REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAD THERE NOT OCCURRED TO ME DURING THAT LAST FEW DAYS
8455-210777-0025 WHAT COULD I DO NOW BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND DIED
8455-210777-0026 AND A DEATH OF WHICH I DREAMT COULD NOT ALAS
8455-210777-0027 WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VESSELS BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSSESSED AT THE FURTHEST SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IN SECLUSION WOULD I END MY DAYS
8455-210777-0028 JACK WOULD BECOME EVA'S HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMIDST THE HURRIED DUTIES OF HIS EAGER WORLD
8455-210777-0029 THINKING OF ALL THIS WE WENT TO SLEEP
8455-210777-0030 MISTER NEVERBEND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD CERTAINLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
8455-210777-0031 YOU HAVE RECEIVED ME WITH ALL THAT COURTESY AND HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STANDS SO HIGH
8455-210777-0032 IT IS HER DUTY SAID I
8455-210777-0033 BUT OUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT
8455-210777-0034 NOT A DOUBT BUT HAD YOUR FORCE BEEN ONLY DOUBLE OR TROUBLE HER OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT MY DUTY TO STRUGGLE WITH YOU
8455-210777-0035 THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVERBEND SAID SIR FERDINAND O'S BROWN
8455-210777-0036 I CANNOT AFFORD TO SMILE BECAUSE I AM ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS BEFORE YOU BUT I DO NOT THE LESS FEEL THAT IN A MATTER OF WHICH THE PROGRESS OF THE WORLD IS CONCERNED I OR RATHER WE HAVE BEEN PUT DOWN BY BRUTE FORCE
8455-210777-0037 YOU HAVE COME TO US THREATENING HER WITH ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION
8455-210777-0038 THEREFORE I FEEL MYSELF QUITE ABLE AS PRESIDENT OF THIS REPUBLIC TO RECEIVE YOU WITH THE COURTESY DUE TO THE SERVANT OF A FRIENDLY ALLY
8455-210777-0039 I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE HIS TRIGGER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BOARD
8455-210777-0040 THEN SAID SIR FERDINANDO THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT I MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM
8455-210777-0041 THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANYTHING WHICH I HAD EVER FELT
8455-210777-0042 YOU HEAR WHAT SIR FERDINANDO BROWN HAS SAID REPLIED CAPTAIN BATTLEAX
8455-210777-0043 BUT WHAT IS THE DELICATE MISS I ASKED
8455-210777-0044 I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSEWHERE OR DROWNED UPON THE VOYAGE IT MATTERED NOT WHERE
8455-210777-0045 AND THE REPUBLIC OF BRITANNULA WAS TO BE DECLARED AS NON EXISTENT AND THE BRITISH FLAG WAS TO BE EXALTED AND A BRITISH GOVERNOR INSTALLED IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
8455-210777-0046 YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE IT'S THERE SAID CAPTAIN BATTLE SAX AND THAT I CAN SO USE IT AS TO HALF OBLITERATE YOUR TOWN WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF MY RETURN ON BOARD
8455-210777-0047 YOU REFUSE TO KIDNAP ME I SAID
8455-210777-0048 WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOUR GUARD WERE I TO KIDNAP YOU
8455-210777-0049 LIEUTENANT GROSTREES IS A VERY GALLANT OFFICER
8455-210777-0050 ONE OF US ALWAYS REMAINS ON BOARD WHILE THE OTHER IS IN SHORE
8455-210777-0051 WHAT WORLDWIDE INIQUITY SUCH A SPEECH AS THAT DISCLOSES SAID I STILL TURNING MYSELF TO THE CAPTAIN FOR THOUGH I WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THEM BOTH BY MY WORDS HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE MY DISLIKE CENTRED ITSELF ON SIR FERDINANDO
8455-210777-0052 YOULL ALLOW ME TO SUGGEST SAID HE THAT THAT IS A MATTER OF OPINION
8455-210777-0053 WERE I TO COMPLY WITH THEIR ORDERS WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY OWN OPINION I SHOULD SEEM TO HAVE DONE SO WILLINGLY HEREAFTER
8455-210777-0054 THE LETTER WENT AS FOLLOWS
8455-210777-0055 SIR I HAVE IT AT COMMAND TO INFORM YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF THE CROWN COLONY WHICH IS CALLED BRITANNULA
8455-210777-0056 THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COMMUNITY ARE WITHIN YOUR EXCELLENCY'S KNOWLEDGE
8455-210777-0057 BUT IN THEIR SELECTION OF A CONSTITUTION THE BRITON YULISTS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY ALLOWED THEMSELVES BUT ONE DELIBERATE ASSEMBLY AND HENCE HAVE SPRUNG THEIR PRESENT DIFFICULTIES
8455-210777-0058 IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVE A PERIOD OF LIFE AT WHICH MEN CEASE TO WORK
8455-210777-0059 BUT IT IS SURMISED THAT YOU WILL FIND DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF YOUR ENTERING AT ONCE UPON YOUR PARTNER
8455-210777-0060 THE JOHN BRIGHT IS ARMED WITH A WEAPON OF GREAT POWER AGAINST WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRITANDULA SHOULD PREVAIL
8455-210777-0061 YOU WILL CARRY OUT WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED MEN OF THE NORTH NORTHWEST BIRMINGHAM REGIMENT WHICH WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE FOR YOUR OWN SECURITY AS IT IS THOUGHT THAT IF MISSUS NEVERBEND BE WITHDRAWN THE PEOPLE WILL REVERT EASILY TO THEIR OLD HABITS OF OBEDIENCE
8455-210777-0062 WHEN DO YOU INTEND THAT THE JOHN BOY SHALL START
8455-210777-0063 TO WHICH I SHOUTED
8455-210777-0064 AND I HAVE NO ONE READY TO WHOM I CAN GIVE UP THE ARCHIVES OF THIS GOVERNMENT
8455-210777-0065 I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TAKE CHARGE OF IT SAID SIR FERDINANDO
8455-210777-0066 THEY OF COURSE MUST ALL BE AUTOR
8455-210777-0067 OR OF THE HABITS OF YOUR PEOPLE IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
8455-210777-0068 MY POWER IS SUFFICIENT I SAID
8455-210777-0069 IF YOU WILL GIVE US YOUR PROMISE TO MEET CAPTAIN ADDLES HERE AT THIS TIME TO MORROW WE WILL STRETCH A POINT AND DELAY THE DEPARTURE OF THE JOHN BRIGHT FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
8455-210777-0070 AND THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED TO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM ME A PROMISE THAT I WOULD DEPART IN PEACE
8463-287645-0000 THIS WAS WHAT DID THE MISCHIEF SO FAR AS THE RUNNING AWAY IS CONCERNED
8463-287645-0001 IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO SAY MORE OF THEM YET
8463-287645-0002 FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF WITH REGARD TO EDWARD HOLLAND NO MAN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF HIS RECOLLECTIONS WILL BE LONGER REMEMBERED THAN HE HIS ENTHRALLMENT WHILE UNDER HOLLAND WILL HARDLY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
8463-287645-0003 OF THIS PARTY EDWARD A BOY OF SEVENTEEN CALLED FORTH MUCH SYMPATHY HE TOO WAS COMMANDED BY HALLEN
8463-287645-0004 JOHN WESLEY COMBASH JOSEPH TAYLOR AND THOMAS EDWARD SKINNER
8463-287645-0005 A FEW YEARS BACK ONE OF THEIR SLAVES A COACHMAN WAS KEPT ON THE COACH BOX ONE COLD NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE OUT AT A BALL UNTIL HE BECAME ALMOST FROZEN TO DEATH IN FACT HE DID DIE IN THE INFIRMARY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE FROST ABOUT A WEEK AFTERWARDS
8463-287645-0006 THE DOCTOR WHO ATTENDED THE INJURED CREATURE IN THIS CASE WAS SIMPLY TOLD THAT SHE SLEPT AND FELL DOWN THE STAIRS AS SHE WAS COMING DOWN
8463-287645-0007 ANOTHER CASE SAID JOHN WEESLEY WAS A LITTLE GIRL HALF GROWN WHO WAS WASHING WINDOWS UP STAIRS ONE DAY AND UNLUCKILY FELL ASLEEP IN THE WINDOW AND IN THIS POSITION WAS FOUND BY HER MISTRESS IN A RAGE THE MISTRESS HIT HER A HEAVY SLAP KNOCKED HER OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SHE FELL TO THE PAVEMENT AND DIED IN A FEW HOURS FROM THE EFFECTS THEREOF
8463-287645-0008 AS USUAL NOTHING WAS SEEN IN THE WAY OF PUNISHMENT
8463-287645-0009 I NEVER KNOW OF BUT ONE MAN WHO COULD EVER PLEASE HIM
8463-287645-0010 HE WORKED ME VERY HARD HE PROMISED TO BE BEATING ME ALL THE TIME
8463-287645-0011 SHE WAS A LARGE HOMELY WOMAN THEY WERE COMMON WHITE PEOPLE OF NO REPUTATION IN THE COMMUNITY
8463-287645-0012 SUBSTANTIALLY THIS WAS JACOB'S UNVARNISHED DESCRIPTION OF THE MASTER AND MISTRESS
8463-287645-0013 AS TO HIS AGE AND ALSO THE NAME OF HIS MASTER JACOB'S STATEMENT VARIED SOMEHOW FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT
8463-287645-0014 OF STARTING I WOULDN'T KNOW THE WAY TO COME
8463-294825-0000 IT'S ALMOST BEYOND CONJECTURES
8463-294825-0001 THIS REALITY BEGINS TO EXPLAIN THE DEEP POWER AND OTHER WORLDLY FASCINATION OF TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS
8463-294825-0002 FIRST AS A BRITISH STOCKBROKER LATER AS A CELEBRATED AUTHOR AND YACHTSMAN HE WENT ON FREQUENT VOYAGES TO BRITAIN AMERICA THE MEDITERRANEAN
8463-294825-0003 NEMO BUILDS A FABULOUS FUTURISTIC SUBMARINE THE NAUTILUS THEN CONDUCTS AN UNDERWATER CAMPAIGN OF VENGEANCE AGAINST HER IMPERIALIST OPPRESSOR
8463-294825-0004 IN ALL THE NOVEL HAD A DIFFICULT GESTATION
8463-294825-0005 OTHER SUBTLETIES OCCUR INSIDE EACH EPISODES THE TEXTURES SPARKLING WITH WIT INFORMATION AND INSIGHT
8463-294825-0006 HIS SPECIFICATIONS FOR A OPEN SEA SUBMARINE AND A SELF CONTAINING DIVING SUIT WERE DECADES BEFORE THEIR TIME YET MODERN TECHNOLOGY BEARS THEM OUT TRIUMPHANTLY
8463-294825-0007 EVEN THE SUPPORTING CASTE IS SHREWDLY DRAWN PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CAREER SCIENTIST CAUGHT IN AN ETHICAL CONFLICT CONSEIL THE COMPULSIVE CLASSIFIER WHO SUPPLIES HUMOROUS TAG LINES FOR VERNE'S BEST FACTS THE HARPOONER NED LAND A CREATURE OF CONSTANT APPETITES MAN AS HEROIC ANIMAL
8463-294825-0008 BUT MUCH OF THE KNOWLEDGE'S BROODING POWER COMES FROM CAPTAIN NEMO
8463-294825-0009 THIS COMPULSION LEADS NEMO INTO UGLY CONTRADICTIONS HE WAS A FIGHTER FOR FREEDOM YET ALL WHO BOARD HIS SHIP ARE IMPRISONED THERE FOR GOOD HE WORKS TO SAVE LIVES BOTH HUMAN AND ANIMAL YET HE HIMSELF CREATES A HOLOCAUST HE DETESTS IMPERIALISM YET HE LAYS PERSONAL CLAIM TO THE SOUTH POLE
8463-294825-0010 AND IN THIS LAST DIRECTION HE FALLS INTO THE CLASSIC SIN OF PRIDE
8463-294825-0011 AND HE IS SWIFTLY PUNISHED
8463-294825-0012 THE NAUTILUS NEARLY PERISHES IN THE ANTARCTIC AND NEMO SINKS INTO A GROWING OPPRESSION
8463-294825-0013 FOR MANY THEN THIS BOOK HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF FASCINATION SURELY ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL NOVELS EVER WRITTEN AN INSPIRATION TO SUCH SCIENTISTS AND DISCOVERERS AS ENGINEER SIMON LAKE OCEANOGRAPHER WM B B POLAR TRAVELER SIR ERNEST SHACKLETON
8463-294825-0014 FATHOM SIX FEET EIGHT
8463-294825-0015 GRAHAM ROUGHLY ONE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AN OZ
8463-294825-0016 MISLIGRAM ROUGHLY ONE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSANDTH OF AN OUNCE

8463-294825-0018 METTRE ROUGHLY ONE YARD THREE INCHES
8463-294825-0019 MILLIMETRE ROUGHLY ONE TWENTY NINTH OF AN INCH
8463-294828-0000 CHAPTER THREE AS THE MASTER WISHES
8463-294828-0001 THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J B HOBSON'S LETTER I NO MORE DREAMED OF CHASING THE UNICORN THAN OF TRYING FOR A NORTH WEST PASSAGE
8463-294828-0002 EVEN SO I WAS JUST RETURNED FROM AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY EXHAUSTED AND BADLY NEEDING A REST
8463-294828-0003 I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE MY COUNTRY AGAIN MY FRIENDS MY MODEST QUARTERS BY THE BOTANICAL GARDEN MY DEARLY BELOVED COLLECTIONS
8463-294828-0004 BUT HOW NOTHING COULD HOLD ME BACK
8463-294828-0005 CONSEIL WAS HIS MANSERVANT
8463-294828-0006 FROM RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SCIENTISTS IN OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE THE BOTANICAL GARDENS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWO
8463-294828-0007 CLASSIFYING WAS SOMETHING TO HIM SO HE KNEW NOTHING ELSE WELL VERSED IN THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION HE WAS POORLY VERSED IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A SPERM WHALE FROM A BALEEN WHALE
8463-294828-0008 AND YET WHAT A FINE GALLANT LAMB
8463-294828-0009 NOT ONCE DID HE COMMENT ON THE LENGTH OR THE HARDSHIPS OF HIS JOURNEY
8463-294828-0010 NEVER DID HE OBJECT TO BUCKLING UP HIS SUITCASE FOR ANY COUNTRY WHETHER CHINA OR THE CONGO NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF IT WAS
8463-294828-0011 AND WENT HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE IN PERFECT CONTENTMENT
8463-294828-0012 PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THIS UNDERHANDED WAY OF ADMITTING THAT I HAD TURNED TWENTY
8463-294828-0013 HE WAS A FANATIC ON FORMALITY AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE IT NOT TIRESOME
8463-294828-0014 THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO STOP AND THINK EVEN FOR A WORLD'S MOST EMOTIONLESS MAN
8463-294828-0015 CONSEIL I CALLED A THIRD TIME CONSEIL ANSWERED
8463-294828-0016 DID MY MASTER SUMMON ME HE SAID ENTERING
8463-294828-0017 PACK AS MUCH INTO MY TRUNK AS YOU CAN MY TRAVELLING KIT MY SUITS SHORTS AND SOCKS DON'T BOTHER COUNTING JUST SQUEEZE IT ALL IN AND HURRY
8463-294828-0018 WE'LL DEAL WITH THEM LATER WHERE
8463-294828-0019 ANYHOW WE'LL LEAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO SHIP A WHOLE MENAGERIE TO FRANCE
8463-294828-0020 YES WE ARE CERTAINLY I RETURNED EVASIVELY BUT AFTER WE MAKE A DETOUR
8463-294828-0021 A SCOUT SLIGHTLY LESS DIRECT THAT'S ALL
8463-294828-0022 WE'RE LEAVING OUT THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
8463-294828-0023 YOU SEE MY FRIEND THERE'S AN ISSUE OF THE MONSTER THE NOTORIOUS NARWHALE
8463-294828-0024 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WILL TAKE US
8463-294828-0025 BUT WE'RE GETTING JUST THE SAME
8463-294828-0026 WE HAVE A COMMANDER WHO'S NAME FOR ANYTHING
8463-294828-0027 I LEFT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING THE CONTAINERS OF STUFFED ANIMALS AND DRIED PLANTS TO PARIS FRANCE
8463-294828-0028 I OPENED A LINE OF CREDIT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE BARBAROUSSA AND CONSEIL AT MY HEELS I JUMPED INTO A CARRIAGE
8463-294828-0029 OUR BAGGAGE WAS IMMEDIATELY CARRIED TO THE DECK OF THE FRIGATE I RODE ABOARD
8463-294828-0030 I HAD ASKED FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT
8463-294828-0031 ONE OF THE SAILORS LED ME TO THE AFTERDECK WHERE I STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF A SMART LOOKING OFFICER WHO EXTENDED HIS HAND FOR ME
8463-294828-0032 IN PERSONS WELCOME ABOARD PROFESSOR YOUR CABIN IS WAITING FOR YOU
8463-294828-0033 I WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH OUR CABIN WHICH WAS LOCATED IN THE STERN AND OPENED INTO THE OFFICERS MESS
8463-294828-0034 WE'LL BE QUITE COMFORTABLE HERE I TOLD MADEMOISELLE
8463-294828-0035 AND SO IF I HAD BEEN DELAYED BY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR EVEN LESS THE FRIGATE WOULD HAVE GONE WITHOUT ME AND I WOULD HAVE MISSED IT ON THIS UNEARTHLY EXTRAORDINARY AND INCONCEIVABLE EXPEDITION WHOSE TRUE STORY MIGHT WELL MEET WITH SOME SCEPTICISM
8463-294828-0036 THE WHARVES OF BROOKLYN AND EVERY PORT OF NEW YORK BORDERING THE EAST RIVER WERE CROWDED WITH CURIOSITY SEEKERS
8463-294828-0037 DEPARTING OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THROATS THREE CHEERS BURST FORTH IN SUCCESSION
8463-294828-0038 THOUSANDS OF HANDKERCHIEFS WERE WAVING ABOVE THESE TIGHTLY PACKED MASSES HAILING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN UNTIL IT REACHED THE WATERS OF THE HUDSON RIVER AND THE TIP OF THE LONG PENINSULA THAT FORMS NEW YORK CITY
8555-284447-0000 THEN HE RUSHED DOWN STAIRS INTO THE COURTYARD SHOUTING LOUDLY FOR HIS SOLDIERS AND THREATENING TO PATCH EVERYBODY IN HIS DOMINIONS IF THE SAILOR MAN WAS NOT RECAPTURED
8555-284447-0001 HOLD HIM FAST MY MEN AND AS SOON AS I'VE HAD MY COFFEE AND OATMEAL I'LL TAKE HIM TO THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE AND MATCH HIM
8555-284447-0002 I WON'T MIND A CUP OF COFFEE MYSELF SAID CAP'N BILL I'VE HAD CONSIDERABLE EXERCISE THIS MORNIN AND I'M ALL READY FOR BREAKFAST
8555-284447-0003 BUT CAP'N BILL MADE NO SUCH ATTEMPT KNOWING THIS WOULD BE USELESS
8555-284447-0004 AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM OF THE GREAT GIANT THE BOOLOOROO GAVE A YELL OF DISAPPOINTMENT
8555-284447-0005 THE ROOM OF THE GREAT NIGHT WAS HIGH AND BIG AND AROUND IT RAN ROWS OF BENCHES FOR THE SPECTATORS TO SIT UPON
8555-284447-0006 IN ONE PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM WAS A RAISED PLATFORM FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY WITH ELEGANT THRONES FOR THE KING AND QUEEN AND SIX SMALLER BUT RICHLY UPHOLSTERED CHAIRS FOR THE SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES
8555-284447-0007 ALSO HER MAJESTY PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANY ONE AND NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER
8555-284447-0008 RICH JEWELS OF BLUE STONES GLITTERED UPON THEIR PERSONS AND THE ROYAL LADIES WERE FULLY AS GLORIOUS AS THEY WERE HAUGHTY AND OVERBEARING
8555-284447-0009 MORNING GIRLS HOPE YOU FEEL AS WELL AS DO LOOK
8555-284447-0010 CONTROL YOURSELVES MY DEARS REPLIED THE BOOLOOROO THE WORST PUNISHMENT I KNOW HOW TO INFLICT ON ANY ONE THIS PRINCE IS ABOUT TO SUFFER YOU WILL SEE A VERY PRETTY PATCHING MY ROYAL DAUGHTERS
8555-284447-0011 SUPPOSE THERE'S A FRIEND
8555-284447-0012 THE GOVERNOR SHOOK HIS HEAD
8555-284447-0013 WHY YOU SAID TO FETCH THE FIRST LIVING CREATURE WE MET AND THAT WAS THE SPILLY GOAT REPLIED THE CAPTAIN PANTING HARD AS HE HELD FAST TO ONE OF THE GOATS HORNS
8555-284447-0014 THE IDEA OF PACKING CAP'N BILL TO A GOAT WAS VASTLY AMUSING TO HIM AND THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE HE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER
8555-284447-0015 THEY LOOK SOMETHING ALIKE YOU KNOW SUGGESTED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER DOUBTFULLY AND THEY'RE NEARLY THE SAME SIZE IF YOU STAND THE GOAT ON HIS HIND LEGS THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME STYLE OF WHISKERS AND THEY'RE BOTH OF THEM OBSTINATE AND DANGEROUS SO THEY OUGHT TO MAKE A GOOD PATCH
8555-284447-0016 FINE GLORIOUSNESS
8555-284447-0017 WHEN THIS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE BOOLOOROO LEANED OVER TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHY THE FRAME RUBBED AWAY SEEMINGLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND HE WAS THE MORE PUZZLED BECAUSE IT HAD NEVER DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE
8555-284447-0018 AT ONCE A GOAT GAVE A LEAP ESCAPED FROM THE SOLDIERS AND WITH BOWED HEAD RUSHED UPON THE BOOLOOROO
8555-284447-0019 BEFORE ANY COULD STOP HIM HE BUTTED HIS MAJESTY SO FURIOUSLY THAT THE KING SOARED FAR INTO THE AIR AND STUMBLED IN A HEAP AMONG THE BENCHES WHERE HE LAY MOANING AND GROANING
8555-284447-0020 THE GIRL'S WARLIKE SPIRIT WAS ROUSED BY THIS SUCCESSFUL ATTACK
8555-284447-0021 THEN THEY SPED IN GREAT HASTE FOR THE DOOR AND THE GOAT GAVE A FINAL BUTT THAT SENT THE ROW OF ROYAL LADIES ALL DIVING INTO THE CORNER IN ANOTHER TANGLE WHEREUPON THEY SHRIEKED IN A MANNER THAT TERRIFIED EVERY ONE WITHIN SOUND OF THEIR VOICES
8555-284447-0022 I HAD A NOTION IT WAS YOU MARY TO SAVE ME FROM THE KNIFE
8555-284447-0023 I COULDN'T SHIVER MUCH BEING BOUND SO TIGHT BUT WHEN I'M LOOSE I MEAN TO HAVE JEST ONE GOOD SHIVER TO RELIEVE MY FEELINS
8555-284447-0024 COME AND LET THE BOOLOOROO SHE SAID GOING TOWARD THE BENCHES
8555-284449-0000 SO THEY WERE QUITE WILLING TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF THEIR GIRL QUEEN AND IN A SHORT TIME THE BLAST OF TRUMPETS AND ROLL OF DRUMS AND CLASHING OF CYMBALS TOLD TROT AND CAP'N BILL THAT THE BLUE BEARDS HAD ASSEMBLED BEFORE THE PALACE
8555-284449-0001 THEN THEY ALL MARCHED OUT A LITTLE WAY INTO THE FIELDS AND FOUND THAT THE ARMY OF PINKIES HAD ALREADY FORMED AND WERE ADVANCING STEADILY TOWARD THEM
8555-284449-0002 AT THE HEAD OF THE PINKIES WERE GHIP GHISIZZLE AND BUTTON BRIGHT WHO HAD THE PARROT ON HIS SHOULDER AND THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY CAPTAIN CORALIE AND CAPTAIN TENTANT AND ROSALIE THE WITCH
8555-284449-0003 WHEN THE BLUESKINS SAW GHIP GHISIZZLE THEY RAISED ANOTHER GREAT SHOUT FOR HE WAS THE FAVORITE OF THE SERVANTS AND VERY POPULAR WITH ALL THE PEOPLE
8555-284449-0004 SINCE LAST THURSDAY I GHIP GHISIZZLE HAVE BEEN THE LAWFUL BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUE COUNTRY BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE CONQUERED BY QUEEN TROT I SUPPOSE I AM CONQUERED TOO AND YOU HAD NO BOOLOOROO AT ALL
8555-284449-0005 WHEN HE FINISHED SHE SAID SERIOUSLY
8555-284449-0006 DON'T WORRY SIZZLE DEAR IT'LL ALL COME RIGHT SOON
8555-284449-0007 NOW THEN LET'S ENTER THE CITY AND ENJOY THE GREAT FEAST THAT'S BEING COOKED I'VE NEARLY STARVED MYSELF FOR THIS CONQUERING KINGDOMS IS HARD WORK
8555-284449-0008 THEN SHE GAVE ROSALIE BACK HER MAGIC RING THANKING HER KIND WITCH FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR THEM
8555-284449-0009 YOU ARE LATE REPLIED THE SAILOR
8555-284449-0010 AND WILL BE SUCH A SATISFACTION
8555-284449-0011 THE GUARDS HAD A TERRIBLE STRUGGLE WITH THE GOAT WHICH WAS LOOSE IN THE ROOM AND STILL WANTED TO FIGHT BUT FINALLY THEY SUBDUED THE ANIMAL AND THEN THEY TOOK THE BOOLOOROO OUT OF THE FRAME HE WAS TIED IN AND BROUGHT BOTH THEM AND THE GOAT BEFORE QUEEN TROT WHO AWAITED THEM IN THE THRONE ROOM OF THE PALACE
8555-284449-0012 I'LL GLADLY DO THAT PROMISED THE NEW BOOLOOROO AND I'LL FEED THE HONORABLE GOAT ALL THE SHAVINGS AND LEATHERS AND TIN CANS HE CAN EAT BESIDES THE GRASS
8555-284449-0013 EXCUSE ME SAID TROT I NEGLECTED TO TELL YOU BUT YOU'RE NOT THE BOOLOOROO ANY MORE
8555-284449-0014 THE WARM BOOLOOROO GROANED
8555-284449-0015 OH I'LL NOT BE WICKED ANY MORE SIGHED THE OLD BOOLOOROO I'LL REFORM
8555-284449-0016 AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN I SHALL BE A MODEL OF DEPORTMENT IF IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO BE OTHERWISE
8555-284449-0017 WHEN FIRST THEY ENTERED THE THRONE ROOM THEY TRIED TO BE AS HAUGHTY AND SCORNFUL AS EVER BUT THE BLUES WHO WERE ASSEMBLED THERE ALL LAUGHED AT THEM AND JEERED THEM FOR THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN ALL THE BLUE COUNTRY WHO LOVED A PRINCESSES THE LEAST LITTLE BIT
8555-284449-0018 SO GHIP GHISIZZLE ORDERED THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE A FILE OF SOLDIERS AND ESCORT THE RAVING BEAUTIES TO THEIR OWN HOME
8555-284449-0019 THAT EVENING TROT GAVE A GRAND BALL ON THE PALACE TO WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE PINKIES AND THE BLUESKINS WERE INVITED
8555-284449-0020 THE COMBINED BANDS OF BOTH THESE COUNTRIES PLAYED THE MUSIC AND A FINE SUPPER WAS SERVED
8555-292519-0000 BRIGHTER THAN EARLY DAWN'S MOST BRILLIANT DYE ARE BLOWN CLEAR BANDS OF CLOUD THROUGH THE SKY THAT SWIRL AND SWEEP AND MEET TO BREAK AND FOAM LIKE RAINBOW VEILS UPON A BUBBLE'S DOME
8555-292519-0001 GUIDED BY YOU HOW WE MAY STROLL TOWARDS DEATH OUR ONLY MUSIC ONE ANOTHER'S BREATH THROUGH GARDENS INTIMATE WITH HOLLYHOCKS WHERE SILENT POPPIES BURN BETWEEN THE ROCKS BY POOLS WHERE BIRCHES BEND TO CONFIDANTS ABOVE GREEN WATERS SCUMMED WITH LILY PLANTS

8555-292519-0007 IT IS MY HEART HUNG IN A SKY AND NO CLOUDS EVER FLOAT BETWEEN THE GRAVE FLOWERS AND MY HEART ON HIGH
