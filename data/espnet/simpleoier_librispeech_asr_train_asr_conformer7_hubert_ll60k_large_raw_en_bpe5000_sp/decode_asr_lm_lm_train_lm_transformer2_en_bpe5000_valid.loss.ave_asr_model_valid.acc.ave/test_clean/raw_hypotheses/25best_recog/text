1089-134686-0000 SHE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STEW FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUTTON PIECES TO BE LADLED OUT IN THICK PEPPERED FLOUR FATTENED SAUCE
1089-134686-0001 STUFF IT INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNSELLED HER
1089-134686-0002 AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID QUARTER OF THE BROTHS
1089-134686-0003 HELLO BERTIE ANY GIRL IN YOUR MIND
1089-134686-0004 NUMBER TEN FRESH NELLIE IS WAITING ON YOU GOOD NIGHT HUSBANDS
1089-134686-0005 THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLEY'S FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALES FOR WEARINESS
1089-134686-0006 THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE TABLE WHEREON ANOTHER EQUATION BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABROAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
1089-134686-0007 A COLD LUCID SIGNIFICANCE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
1089-134686-0008 THE CHAOS IN WHICH HIS ARDOR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLDLY INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
1089-134686-0009 AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF EVERY GRACE
1089-134686-0010 BUT NOW ENNIS I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
1089-134686-0011 ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE SODALITY MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECITE A LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS A CUSHIONED KNEELING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSES
1089-134686-0012 HER EYE SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLINESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
1089-134686-0013 IF EVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER FRIEND
1089-134686-0014 HE TRIED TO THINK HOW IT MUST BE
1089-134686-0015 BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOLROOM FOLLOWED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
1089-134686-0016 THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATECHISM DAEDALOUS
1089-134686-0017 STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HERON CHUCKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
1089-134686-0018 IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE REGULAR LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
1089-134686-0019 THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENDS AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEMED TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLEN SPACE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROPE IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
1089-134686-0020 IF A MAN HAD STOLEN A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO AMASS A HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GET BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOLEN ONLY OR THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST ACCRUING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
1089-134686-0021 IF A LAYMAN ON GIVING BAPTISM POUR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
1089-134686-0022 HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BEATITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF RIGHT THE SECOND BEATITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
1089-134686-0023 WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY BODY AND BLOOD SOUL AND DIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
1089-134686-0024 IF THE WINES CHANGE INTO VINEGAR AND THE HOST CRUMBLE INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IT IS JESUS CHRIST STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
1089-134686-0025 A GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY AND THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
1089-134686-0026 THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR A CATECHISM TO HEAR THE LESSON FROM HER
1089-134686-0027 HE CLASPED HIS EYES ON THE DESK AND SAID
1089-134686-0028 THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOUR OF SAINT FRANCIS XAVIOUR WHOSE FEAST DAY WAS SATURDAY
1089-134686-0029 ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL OF THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS
1089-134686-0030 BEWARE OF MY MAKING THAT MISTAKE
1089-134686-0031 STEPHEN'S HEAD BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FADE WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING FLOWER
1089-134686-0032 HE IS CALLED SO YOU KNOW THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIES
1089-134686-0033 A GOOD SAINT SAINT FRANCIS XAVIOUR
1089-134686-0034 THE RECTOR PAUSED AND AGAIN SHAKING HIS CLASPED HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON
1089-134686-0035 HE HAD THE FAITH IN HER THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS
1089-134686-0036 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS XAVI
1089-134686-0037 IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DESK INTO A TAWNY GLOW
1089-134691-0000 IF HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0001 FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WONDERING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0002 HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE FROM THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE
1089-134691-0003 THE UNIFORMITY
1089-134691-0004 PRIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAKES
1089-134691-0005 WHOSE FEET ARE AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING EYES
1089-134691-0006 THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF AN OFFICE HE HAD REFUSED
1089-134691-0007 SOON THE WHOLE BROOD WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING
1089-134691-0008 THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE INTO HIS OWN FACE
1089-134691-0009 ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW THE REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK HATS AND HUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKY
1089-134691-0010 BROTHER MACARDLE BROTHER KEELF
1089-134691-0011 THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT IS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION
1089-134691-0012 IT WAS IDLE OF HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
1089-134691-0013 IDLE AND EMBITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE AND TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
1089-134691-0014 THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SEA HARMONIZED IN ACCORD
1089-134691-0015 WORDS WERE IT THEIR COLOURS
1089-134691-0016 THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NOMADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND THE WESTWARD BOUND
1089-134691-0017 THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEYS AND WOODS BEGIRT AND CITADELLED AND OF INTRENCHED AND MARSHALLED RACES
1089-134691-0018 THEN AGAIN AGAIN
1089-134691-0019 A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALLING IT
1089-134691-0020 HELLO STEPHANOS HERE COMES THE DAEDALUS
1089-134691-0021 THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HEWN STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSEPLAY GLEAMED WITH A COLD WET LUSTRE
1089-134691-0022 HE STOOD STILL IN DEFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED HER BANTER WITH EASY WORDS
1089-134691-0023 IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE WRETCHEDNESS
1089-134691-0024 STEPHANO STAADLOS
1089-134691-0025 A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAZE CAPT CITY
1188-133604-0000 YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITIAN HOLBEIN TURNER AND TINTORETTI IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
1188-133604-0001 THEY UNITE EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERRING TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS CHIOSCUROS
1188-133604-0002 BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CURUSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN THE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
1188-133604-0003 MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF THE DISTINCT HUE SIDE BY SIDE
1188-133604-0004 SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGES
1188-133604-0005 IT IS THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FOR A PICTURE OF CARPATIUS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
1188-133604-0006 THEN HE COMES IN THE BEAK OF IT
1188-133604-0007 THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK IS PUT UPON THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY DEFINE THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE
1188-133604-0008 FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SCALE OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH
1188-133604-0009 NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS ENCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMETHING MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEY ARE GRADATED JUSTLY
1188-133604-0010 BUT IN THIS VIGNETTE COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES DRAWN OUT PERFECTLY
1188-133604-0011 THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAT I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON THE LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVOURITE CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER
1188-133604-0012 IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORIST WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS THE SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUE IS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS
1188-133604-0013 IT MUST REMEMBER BEING ONE OR THE OTHER
1188-133604-0014 DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHICAL SCHOOL IS AN EASY ONE
1188-133604-0015 THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS CAN BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
1188-133604-0016 THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT A WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELLER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
1188-133604-0017 THAT A STILE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS
1188-133604-0018 IN ALL EARTHLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND A FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
1188-133604-0019 THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY CHEAP AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
1188-133604-0020 FOR OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
1188-133604-0021 IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREST PAINTINGS UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
1188-133604-0022 YE MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
1188-133604-0023 THAT COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PAROQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGING AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
1188-133604-0024 NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDIES OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
1188-133604-0025 YOU KNOW I'D JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0026 THERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO AND THE PYTHON
1188-133604-0027 NOW HERE IS RAPHAEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL THE MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
1188-133604-0028 WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNER'S GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST NOTE OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0029 ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF SOUND AND FIRE
1188-133604-0030 HE KNOWS THEN BOTH
1188-133604-0031 THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER SAID DUDLEY AND THE FLINT
1188-133604-0032 IT IS ONLY A PENCIL OUTLINE BY EDWARD BYRNE JONES A ILLUSTRATION OF THE STORY OF PSYCHE IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
1188-133604-0033 EVERY PLANT ON THE GRASS IS SET FORMALLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALISED COMPLETELY
1188-133604-0034 EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHAUCER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON HIS CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
1188-133604-0035 THUS IN CHAUCER'S DREAMED
1188-133604-0036 IN BOTH THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOUGH SUFFERING IT IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
1188-133604-0037 EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF HOLBEIN OR DURAU
1188-133604-0038 AND NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT ON WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL
1188-133604-0039 IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALITY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED OR POOR
1188-133604-0040 THE CRAMPNESS AND THE POVERTY ARE ALL WRITTEN
1188-133604-0041 IT IS A GLEANER BRINGING OUT HER ONE SHEAF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATER MILL ITSELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET ITS STONES TO TURN
1188-133604-0042 THE SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN AND
1188-133604-0043 SEE THAT YOUR LIES BE AND NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED KITE
1188-133604-0044 IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KITES FLY FALCONS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THEIR LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WAR WOLF AND THE GEAR EAGLE
121-121726-0000 ALSO A POPULAR CONTRIVANCE WHEREBY LOVE MAKING MAY BE SUSPENDED BUT NOT STOPPED DURING THE PICNIC SCENE
121-121726-0001 HARANGUE THE TIRESOME PRODUCT OF A TIRELESS TIDE
121-121726-0002 ANGER PAIN PAINFUL TO HEAR AND
121-121726-0003 HAY FEVER A HEART TROUBLE CAUSED BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A GRASS WIDOWED
121-121726-0004 HEAVEN A BIG PLACE TO BE RAISED TO
121-121726-0005 HEDGE OFFICE
121-121726-0006 TO HEREDITY THE CAUSE OF ALL OUR FAULTS
121-121726-0007 HORSE SENSE A DEGREE OF WISDOM THAT KEEPS ONE FROM BETTING ON THE PACES
121-121726-0008 HOSE MAN'S EXCUSE FOR WETTING THE MOUTH
121-121726-0009 HOTEL A PLACE WHERE A GUEST OFTEN GIVES UP HIS GOOD DOLLARS FOR POOR QUARTERS
121-121726-0010 HOUSE CLEANING IN A DOMESTIC UPHEAVAL THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ENLIST ALL THE SOLDIERS IT NEEDS
121-121726-0011 I HUSBAND THE NEXT THING TO A WIFE
121-121726-0012 HUSSY WOMAN AND BOND TIER
121-121726-0013 TIED UP TO A WOMAN
121-121726-0014 HYPOCRITE IS A HORSEDEALER
121-123852-0000 THOSE PRETTY WRONGS THAT LIBERTY COMMITS WHEN I AM SOME TIME ABSENT FROM THY HEART THY BEAUTY AND THY YEARS FULL WELL BEFITS FOR STILL TEMPTATION FOLLOWS WHEN THOU ART

121-123859-0004 SO I RETURN REBUKED TO MY CONTENT AND GAIN BY ILL THRICE MORE THAN I HAVE SPOKEN
121-127105-0000 IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT DREW FROM DOUGLAS NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING A REPLY THAT IT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
121-127105-0001 SOME ONE ELSE TOLD A STORY NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WHICH I SEE HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING
121-127105-0002 CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF INSTEAD OF ME HE SAW WHAT HE SPOKE FOR
121-127105-0003 THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROAN AT THIS AND AS MUCH REPROACH AFTER WHICH IN HIS PREOCCUPIED WAY HE EXPLAINED
121-127105-0004 AND STORY'S WRITTEN
121-127105-0005 I COULD WRITE TO MY MAN AND ENCLOSE THE KEY I COULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FINDS IT
121-127105-0006 THE OTHERS RESENTED POSTPONEMENT BUT IT WAS JUST HIS SCRUPLES THAT CHARMED HIM
121-127105-0007 TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT OH THANK GOD NO IT IS THE RECORD YOURS
121-127105-0008 HE HUNG FIRE AGAIN A MOMENT'S
121-127105-0009 SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THESE FOURTEEN YEARS
121-127105-0010 SHE SENT ME THE PAGES IN QUESTION AFTER SHE DIED
121-127105-0011 SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHAT
121-127105-0012 IT WASN'T CERTAINLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE
121-127105-0013 YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE THEY CONTINUED TO FIX ME
121-127105-0014 BUT YOU ARE ACUTE
121-127105-0015 HE QUITTED THEIR FIRE AND DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
121-127105-0016 PROBABLY NOT TILL THE SECOND BOAT
121-127105-0017 IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL WAIT
121-127105-0018 CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIX
121-127105-0019 MISSUS GRIFFIN ALWAYS EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT
121-127105-0020 WHO WAS IT SHE IS IN LOVE WITH THE STORY WILL TELL I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO REPLY OH I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE STORY THE STORY WON'T TELL SAID DOUGLAS NOT IN ANY LITERAL VULGAR WAY MORE'S THE PITY THEN
121-127105-0021 WON'T YOU TELL ALL DOUGLAS
121-127105-0022 WELL IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHERE HE WAS
121-127105-0023 LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY DESCRIBE
121-127105-0024 POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO MEMORY THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH
121-127105-0025 THE PARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED US UP
121-127105-0026 THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MEASURE BEGUN
121-127105-0027 HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED TO
121-127105-0028 THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT SHE HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME
121-127105-0029 THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITIES
121-127105-0030 I DON'T ANTICIPATE I
121-127105-0031 SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESSES
121-127105-0032 YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PATCH
121-127105-0033 IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF AN
121-127105-0034 IT SOUNDED DELICIOUS BUT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MAIN CONDITION WHICH WAS
121-127105-0035 SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDING
121-127105-0036 FOR WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED
1221-135766-0000 HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED HER GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
1221-135766-0001 GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH HE THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONOURED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOREVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN
1221-135766-0002 YET THE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
1221-135766-0003 THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE THAT DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
1221-135766-0004 THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE SERIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
1221-135766-0005 HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THIS MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
1221-135766-0006 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THAT DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
1221-135766-0007 HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHERS OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
1221-135766-0008 MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER HER INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135766-0009 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR NOT LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT
1221-135766-0010 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HE COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARLE WAS A HUMAN CHILD
1221-135766-0011 BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PLEASURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE
1221-135766-0012 BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
1221-135766-0013 PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCASTS OF THE INFANTILE WORLD
1221-135766-0014 PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE
1221-135766-0015 IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN AND
1221-135767-0000 HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF THE POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY
1221-135767-0001 ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERING OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
1221-135767-0002 AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER POLITICAL INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE
1221-135767-0003 THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORKS ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
1221-135767-0004 WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S LARGE AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
1221-135767-0005 IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER POINT THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
1221-135767-0006 THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT HIS SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE
1221-135767-0007 BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY WAS HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
1221-135767-0008 COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD WITH THEM
1221-135767-0009 BUT PERILE WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
1221-135767-0010 SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE IN THEM
1221-135767-0011 IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN TO THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
1221-135767-0012 THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICED WINDOWS THE GOLDEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
1221-135767-0013 LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BONDED SERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
1221-135767-0014 YEA HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEECHE
1221-135767-0015 YE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOT
1221-135767-0016 WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIR AND STATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
1221-135767-0017 ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF THE OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE
1221-135767-0018 LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTISPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING IN THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREAST PLATE
1221-135767-0019 MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK SO
1221-135767-0020 IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTE HIDDEN BEHIND IT
1221-135767-0021 PEARLE ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG A VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY
1221-135767-0022 BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON HIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
1221-135767-0023 THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS STOOD ON THE BACK OF A BULL
1221-135767-0024 PERE SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
1284-1180-0000 HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS A BLUE KNEE PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD
1284-1180-0001 HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AND A FLAT BRIM AND BEHIND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
1284-1180-0002 INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BIG COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID
1284-1180-0003 FOR A LONG TIME I HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED
1284-1180-0004 WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNC SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOORS AND STARTED UP THE PATH
1284-1180-0005 NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THAT LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
1284-1180-0006 AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE ULICANS THE PATH DIVIDED
1284-1180-0007 HE KNEW HE WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
1284-1180-0008 ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE REST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
1284-1180-0009 THEN THEY STARTED UPON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT
1284-1180-0010 UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED BOY DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
1284-1180-0011 I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY
1284-1180-0012 WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS OR LONELIER PLACE
1284-1180-0013 AND YOU MUST BE OJOS THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED
1284-1180-0014 OZJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE
1284-1180-0015 WE'RE TRAVELLING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOP IN YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
1284-1180-0016 THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTLESS
1284-1180-0017 AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A SMALL LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
1284-1180-0018 IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I'M MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
1284-1180-0019 YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO THE OLD MOMBI THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
1284-1180-0020 THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON A GLASS HAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
1284-1180-0021 I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE PHYSICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
1284-1180-0022 I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF UZ
1284-1180-0023 YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC NUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME NOTHING
1284-1180-0024 THAT IS THE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE
1284-1180-0025 I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU YOUR PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGOLOTTE LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
1284-1180-0026 BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
1284-1180-0027 YET THAT TASK WAS NOT AS EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
1284-1180-0028 A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS OR COLOURS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER
1284-1180-0029 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES OR COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
1284-1180-0030 WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLOURS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS WERE
1284-1180-0031 AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OZMA LIVES GREEN AS THE POPULAR COLOR
1284-1180-0032 I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB YOU DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
1284-1181-0000 OJOLE EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
1284-1181-0001 MARGOLOT HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL THROUGHOUT
1284-1181-0002 THE THOUGHT OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
1284-1181-0003 THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HANGING DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
1284-1181-0004 GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON MEDAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIANT
1284-1181-0005 NOW I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
1284-1181-0006 WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARJOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
1284-1181-0007 SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BUNDLES
1284-1181-0008 I THINK YOU WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
1284-1181-0009 SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPING HIM LIFT THE FOUR KETTLES FROM THE FIRE
1284-1181-0010 THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE THE FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
1284-1181-0011 VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALL TOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE THEY MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
1284-1181-0012 NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE PILE OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
1284-1181-0013 OJO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THEIR CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
1284-1181-0014 HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER WOULD BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
1284-1181-0015 MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH THOUGH IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
1284-1181-0016 I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MINE OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
1284-1181-0017 THE WIZARD OF OZ WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS REALLY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERESS
1284-1181-0018 IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MERCHANT
1284-1181-0019 I NOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY AND MY GARDEN
1284-1181-0020 DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTERBOX YOU'RE GETTING TO BE UNC REMARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO IS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
1284-1181-0021 ASKED THE GIRL IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
1284-134647-0000 THAT GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTERESTS
1284-134647-0001 THE EDICT OF MILAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROCLAIMING HIS OWN RELIGION
1284-134647-0002 BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR IMBIBED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTS WHICH DISSENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY A TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
1284-134647-0003 CONSTANTINE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERETICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING DAMNATION
1284-134647-0004 SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EDICTS OF DIOCLETIAN AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLAUDED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE WRONGS OF HUMANITY
1284-134647-0005 THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXULTATION THAT THE APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTAGION OF GUILT AND SCHISM AND THAT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAS PRESERVED INVIOLATE THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISCIPLINE
1284-134647-0006 BISHOPS VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DONAPTISTS
1284-134647-0007 PROSCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DONAGTISTS STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN NUMIDIA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGED THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
1320-122612-0000 SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TALE THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS SO NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGE IS EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATE ITS WILD RECESSES
1320-122612-0001 THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXHALE AND THE SUN HAD DISPENSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHEDDING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FORESTS WHEN THE TRAVELLERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
1320-122612-0002 AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAKAS WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
1320-122612-0003 HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULET WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE CHARACTER OF ITS WATERS
1320-122612-0004 DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGATCHGOOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
1320-122612-0005 YET HERE ARE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCAROONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL AS WE CROSSED
1320-122612-0006 AND LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEENER EYES
1320-122612-0007 CHINGACHGOOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND THEN MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK
1320-122612-0008 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THAT YOUTH ASSUMED
1320-122612-0009 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD IT SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING
1320-122612-0010 SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HARE HAS GONE TOWARD THE FORESTS
1320-122612-0011 IF A ROCK OR A RIVULET OR A BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE CLUE THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MINUTE NECESSARY
1320-122612-0012 EXTINGUISHED BRANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE OFFALS OF A DEER WAS SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWSED BY THE HORSES
1320-122612-0013 A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGMENT FOR HIS STATION
1320-122612-0014 THE EXPLANATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
1320-122612-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOIST ALLUVIO
1320-122612-0016 RUN BACK UNCAS AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SINGER'S COAT
1320-122617-0000 NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HAWKEYE HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE IS ABOUT TO INCUR
1320-122617-0001 IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACUTE AND PRACTISED INTELLECTS WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICIONS ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
1320-122617-0002 IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BALAIM'S ASS TO SPEAK HE WAS SOMEWHAT SCEPTICAL ON THE SUBJECT OF A BEAR'S SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
1320-122617-0003 THERE WERE SOMETHING IN HIS AIR AND MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
1320-122617-0004 THE INGENIOUS HAWKEYE WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST BY THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
1320-122617-0005 THE BEAR SHOWED HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
1320-122617-0006 I CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HIM
1320-122617-0007 COME COME RETURNED HAWKEYE ENCASING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE AS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN AND THE SUN HAVE NOT BETRAYED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS
1320-122617-0008 THE YOUNG MAN IS IN BONDAGE AND MUCH I FEARS HIS DEATH IS DECREED
1320-122617-0009 I GREATLY MOURN THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HYMN CAN YOU LEAD ME TO
1320-122617-0010 THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURNED EDWARD HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FEAR YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THAN MITIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
1320-122617-0011 THE LODGE IN WHICH UNCAS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE VALLEY AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
1320-122617-0012 FOUR OR FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOORS OF THE PRISON OF UNCAS WARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
1320-122617-0013 DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF ASSENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE IN WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF HAPPINESS IN AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
1320-122617-0014 THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTIONED OF THE SUPPOSED CONJUROR TO ENTER
1320-122617-0015 BUT THE PAIR INSTEAD OF OBEYING MAINTAINED THE SEAT IT HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
1320-122617-0016 THE CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREAD WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TOO CONTINUED DAVID IMPROVING THE HINT HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
1320-122617-0017 THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY GAINED THE PLACE
1320-122617-0018 IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE AND LIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF THAT FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COOKERY
1320-122617-0019 UNCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PITIFUL WITHES
1320-122617-0020 THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISES UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY
1320-122617-0021 WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE MINGOES AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THE SINGER IS AS GOOD AS NOTHING
1320-122617-0022 THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUTSTRIPS THE DEER
1320-122617-0023 UNCAS WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR IN READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND LAID HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
1320-122617-0024 BUT HAWKEYE WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED BY HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO HIS COMPANION
1320-122617-0025 SO UNCAS YOU HAD BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKINS AGAIN AND TRUST TO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED
1320-122617-0026 WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE AT WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION
1320-122617-0027 AS SOON AS THESE POSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
1320-122617-0028 MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY AND LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NETTLED AT SO DIRECT AN ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN OF THE GREATEST STRAITS
1320-122617-0029 IF YOU ARE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING A NON COMPOS WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED
1320-122617-0030 SO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF TO MAKE A RUSH OR TARRY
1320-122617-0031 BRAVELY AND GENEROUSLY HAS HE BATTLED IN MY BEHALF IN THIS AND MORE WILL I DARE IN HIS SERVICE
1320-122617-0032 KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH MAY SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
1320-122617-0033 IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND UPON IT UNCAS AND I SHALL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT AS BECOMES TRUE WARRIORS AND TRUSTY FRIENDS
1320-122617-0034 HOLD SAID DAVID PERCEIVING THAT WITH THIS ASSURANCE THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM I AM AN UNWORTHY AND HUMBLE FOLLOWER OF ONE WHO TAUGHT NAUGHT THE DAMNABLE PRINCIPLES OF REVENGE
1320-122617-0035 THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN PINING FOR A POSITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTISE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT A CROSS OF BLOOD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN
1320-122617-0036 GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SCENT IS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING ETERNITY BEFORE THE EYES WHEN MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS AND THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
1320-122617-0037 THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND PEERING THROUGH THAT DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
1320-122617-0038 WILL THE HULLS HEAR HIS GROANS
1320-122617-0039 THE MOHICAN STARTED ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK HIS SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HAD COUNTERFEITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
1320-122617-0040 HE HAD NO REASON TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
1320-122617-0041 AND UNCAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS
1580-141083-0000 I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS COULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
1580-141083-0001 I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASIONS HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
1580-141083-0002 MY FRIEND'S TEMPERS HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
1580-141083-0003 WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMMON MAN
1580-141083-0004 WE HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
1580-141083-0005 I I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
1580-141083-0006 THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY BEDROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
1580-141083-0007 THE MOMENT I LOOKED TO MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOME ONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
1580-141083-0008 THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD BROUGHT THEM ALL TOGETHER
1580-141083-0009 THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY AT THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0010 I GAVE THEM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
1580-141083-0011 A GREAT TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
1580-141083-0012 NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOUGH OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKED LIKE SAWDUST IN
1580-141083-0013 ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND TO DISCREETLY
1580-141083-0014 TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED OVER
1580-141083-0015 DID ANY ONE KNOW THAT THESE TRUTHS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
1580-141083-0016 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPENING
1580-141083-0017 SO IT IS SEEMS TO ME
1580-141083-0018 NOW MASTER SOLMES AT YOUR DISPOSAL
1580-141083-0019 ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH CHAIR
1580-141083-0020 THEN HE PRODUCED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
1580-141083-0021 THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT ON ONE PANE SAID OUR LEARNED GUIDE
1580-141083-0022 I I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
1580-141083-0023 ONE COULD HARDLY HOPED FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
1580-141083-0024 YOU LEFT ME IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
1580-141083-0025 THE MEN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET AFTER SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
1580-141083-0026 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE HAD NOT SAID SOLMES FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
1580-141083-0027 HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY USEFUL CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
1580-141083-0028 THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE END
1580-141083-0029 HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT AND YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
1580-141083-0030 MISTER SOLMES WAS SOMEWHAT ABSORBED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
1580-141083-0031 HOLMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS N N AND A SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU KNOW
1580-141083-0032 WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE THE OTHERS
1580-141083-0033 I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THEN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
1580-141083-0034 AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN HE WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
1580-141083-0035 HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE DOOR HELLO WHAT IS THIS
1580-141083-0036 HOLMES HELD IT OUT ON HIS OWN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
1580-141083-0037 WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSH INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
1580-141083-0038 I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE MANY STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
1580-141083-0039 AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR AN EXAMINATION YES
1580-141083-0040 ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHICH THERE ARE NO PROOFS
1580-141083-0041 LET US MEET THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
1580-141083-0042 MY SOVEREIGN HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
1580-141083-0043 THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MYLES MC GARREN
1580-141083-0044 I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE HAS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
1580-141083-0045 HE WAS SO SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
1580-141083-0046 BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT SUCH TIMES
1580-141083-0047 LET YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
1580-141083-0048 HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEY AND THE DOOR
1580-141083-0049 ANY ONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET DOWN YES SIR
1580-141083-0050 I RATHER DON'T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MISTER HOLMES
1580-141083-0051 ONLY FOR A MINUTE OR SO I
1580-141083-0052 OH I MUST NOT VENTURE TO SAY SIR
1580-141083-0053 YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM NO NO SIR
1580-141084-0000 IT WAS THE ENEMY WHOSE DARK SILHOUETTE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BLIND
1580-141084-0001 I WAS PACING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
1580-141084-0002 THIS SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO COME OVER THEM
1580-141084-0003 NO NAMES PLEASE SAID HOLMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GILCRETH'S DOOR
1580-141084-0004 OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
1580-141084-0005 THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT ANSWERED HOLMES
1580-141084-0006 HE DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE THE POSITION
1580-141084-0007 TO MORROW IN THE EXAMINATION
1580-141084-0008 I CANNOT ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THEIR PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
1580-141084-0009 BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
1580-141084-0010 I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCILLINGS GOOD BYE
1580-141084-0011 WHEN WE CAME OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
1580-141084-0012 THE FOUL MOUTHING FELLOW AT THE TOP
1580-141084-0013 HE HAS THE ONE WITH THE WORST RECORD
1580-141084-0014 WHY BANNISTER THE SERVANT WHAT'S HIS GAME IN A MATTER
1580-141084-0015 HE IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST ONE
1580-141084-0016 MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAVOUR BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION
1580-141084-0017 HAVE NO GOOD MY DEAR WATSON
1580-141084-0018 I THINK SO YOU HAVE FORMED HIS CONCLUSION
1580-141084-0019 YES MY DEAR MOTSON I HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY
1580-141084-0020 LOOK AT THAT HE HELD OUT HER HAND
1580-141084-0021 ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PYRAMIDS OF BROWN DOUGHY CLAY
1580-141084-0022 AND ONE MORE HIS MORNING
1580-141084-0023 IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND SHE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP
1580-141084-0024 HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT YE HAVE COME
1580-141084-0025 YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO TOO
1580-141084-0026 IF THIS LETTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARTIAL
1580-141084-0027 NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT A
1580-141084-0028 THERE WAS NO MAN SIRS
1580-141084-0029 HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND PRESENTLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANNISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER
1580-141084-0030 JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID SOLMES
1580-141084-0031 WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GILCRIST HOW YOU THE HONORABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH AN ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
1580-141084-0032 FOR A MOMENT GILCREST WITH UPRAISED HAND TRIED TO CONTROL HIS WRITHING FEELINGS
1580-141084-0033 COME COME SAID HOLMES KINDLY IT IS HUMAN TO ERR AND AT LEAST NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF HAVING A CALLOUS CRIMINAL
1580-141084-0034 WELL WELL DON'T TROUBLE TO ANSWER LISTEN BUT SEE THAT I DO YOU NO INJUSTICE
1580-141084-0035 HE COULD EXAMINE THE PAPERS IN HIS NEW OFFICE
1580-141084-0036 THE INDIAN I ALSO HEARD NOTHING OF
1580-141084-0037 WHEN I APPROACHED YOUR ROOF I EXAMINED THE WINDOW
1580-141084-0038 AND NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
1580-141084-0039 I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE SUSPICIONS OF THE SIDE TABLE
1580-141084-0040 HE RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU ARE WEARY WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES
1580-141084-0041 NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED THE DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
1580-141084-0042 A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED OF PROOFS
1580-141084-0043 HE PUT HIS SHOES ON HER TABLE
1580-141084-0044 GLOVES SAID THE YOUNG ONE
1580-141084-0045 SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIM AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO VISIBLE ESCAPE
1580-141084-0046 HAVE I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH MISTER GILCREST
1580-141084-0047 I HAVE A LETTER HERE MISS SOLMES WHICH I WROTE TO YOU EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTLESS NIGHT
1580-141084-0048 IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE WE WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
1580-141084-0049 IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD SEEN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW
1580-141084-0050 IT MISTER SOLMES SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP
1995-1826-0000 IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENSE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM
1995-1826-0001 THAT SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLEANS
1995-1826-0002 JOHN TAYLOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTONTON
1995-1826-0003 BETTER NOT GO HE HAD COUNSELLED SENTENTIOUSLY
1995-1826-0004 MIGHT I LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL DOWN THERE
1995-1826-0005 BUT JOHN THERE'S NO SOCIETY' JUST ELEMENTARY WORK
1995-1826-0006 BEEN A LOOKING UP TOMBES COUNTY
1995-1826-0007 FIND SOME CRESSWELLS THERE BIG PLANTATIONS RATED AT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
1995-1826-0008 SOME OTHERS TOO BIG THE COTTON COUNTY
1995-1826-0009 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES I'LL SCARCELY HEAR MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS
1995-1826-0010 AT ANY RATE I CAN SAY GO
1995-1826-0011 HERE SHE WAS TEACHING A DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODORS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE
1995-1826-0012 SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF THE GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS
1995-1826-0013 SO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TO DAY AS SHE WALKING ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE BOTTOMS
1995-1826-0014 AT COTTON SHE PAUSED
1995-1826-0015 SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN AND IT WAS HERE WITHIN TOUCH AND SIGHT
1995-1826-0016 THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES STIRRED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD
1995-1826-0017 THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WERE SUCH DESPERATE PROSE
1995-1826-0018 HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE YOUNG STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
1995-1826-0019 COTTON IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIM
1995-1826-0020 MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARK SEEMED CALLED FORWARD
1995-1826-0021 DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LIT'RALLY BORN AND COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO
1995-1826-0022 I S'POSE THOUGHT IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION
1995-1826-0023 GOOBERS DON'T GROW ON DE TOPS OB VINES BUT ON DE GROUND ON DE ROOTS LIKE YAMS IS THAT SO
1995-1826-0024 THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HEARKLED
1995-1826-0025 SOMETIME YOU'LL TELL ME PLEASE WONT YOU
1995-1826-0026 NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING THE COTTON
1995-1836-0000 THE HONORABLE CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MISSUS EASTERLEY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
1995-1836-0001 AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AS HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE
1995-1836-0002 WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN WERE
1995-1836-0003 SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCES OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERS
1995-1836-0004 AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESTS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TONIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CRIPTON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CRITON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY
1995-1836-0005 MISSUS GREY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND AS SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH
1995-1836-0006 SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGROES EDUCATION
1995-1836-0007 DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARY TAYLOR
1995-1836-0008 I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HER
1995-1836-0009 BUT CRESWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY IN RACES
1995-1836-0010 THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMEN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GRAY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE WHAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM
1995-1836-0011 POSITIVELY HEROIC ADDED CRESWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S FACE
1995-1836-0012 BUT WE'RE NOT ER ER EXACTLY WELCOME
1995-1836-0013 MERRY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZORA TO MISSUS GREY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER
1995-1836-0014 FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THEIR MATTERS
1995-1837-0000 HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS AND ZOORAS MUST BE RUINED
1995-1837-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT A FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT
1995-1837-0002 BUT THE SWAMP THE CRUEL SWAMP
1995-1837-0003 THIS REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER
1995-1837-0004 HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR DID AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND KNEW NOT
1995-1837-0005 IT WAS SO STRANGE AND HUMAN A CREATURE
1995-1837-0006 THE WORLD WAS WATER VEILED IN MIST AND
1995-1837-0007 THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY IS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STEAMED
1995-1837-0008 WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING I
1995-1837-0009 THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DIKES A WEEK AGO AND NOW IT
1995-1837-0010 PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEEPING OH
1995-1837-0011 HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED TOWARDS SADLY
1995-1837-0012 HE SPLASHED AND STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE THREE BRIDGE
1995-1837-0013 THEN HE CALLED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRY
1995-1837-0014 HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUN LIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWY
1995-1837-0015 THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST A BOWLS
1995-1837-0016 FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN HE LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST A TREE
1995-1837-0017 HE GAZED ABOUT PERPLEXED AS ASTONISHED
1995-1837-0018 HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAINS SOME ONE HAD DUG A CANAL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY GRADUALLY
1995-1837-0019 HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST SORROWS
1995-1837-0020 THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TWO
1995-1837-0021 THIS HOPE AND DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND
1995-1837-0022 UP IN THE SICK ROOM ZORRA LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED
1995-1837-0023 THE NETS AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED
1995-1837-0024 FOR A WHILE SHE SAT IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AT SUN AND BIRD AND TREE
1995-1837-0025 SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMPS
1995-1837-0026 SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROW AND WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
1995-1837-0027 ON SHE HURRIED WHILE SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LO THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER
1995-1837-0028 THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW THIS
1995-1837-0029 HE DARTED THROUGH THE BUSHES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE
2094-142345-0000 IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPENSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOORPLACE
2094-142345-0001 BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT'S NEVER OPENED
2094-142345-0002 FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH THE SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR
2094-142345-0003 A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END AND FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS
2094-142345-0004 AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND DOOR
2094-142345-0005 SEVERAL CLOTHES HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF FEATHERED RAGS
2094-142345-0006 AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL USE OF ITS NOSE
2094-142345-0007 THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS PLAIN ENOUGH
2094-142345-0008 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED JACKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE
2094-142345-0009 FOR THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY A WHITTAW OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TREDDLESTON GOSSIP
2094-142345-0010 HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED UPON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
2094-142345-0011 DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY OF FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAKEN LIGHTFOOTED
2094-142345-0012 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND THE NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY
2094-142345-0013 HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT IT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
2094-142345-0014 THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WHIPDAHS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
2094-142345-0015 TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL COOKING TIME
2094-142345-0016 SPINNING DEED
2094-142345-0017 I NEVER KNEW YOUR EQUALS FOR GALLOWSMAN
2094-142345-0018 WHO TAUGHT YOU TO SCRUB A FLOOR HE SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
2094-142345-0019 COMB THE WOOL FOR THE WHITTAHS DEED
2094-142345-0020 SO THAT'S WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE DOING IS IT
2094-142345-0021 THAT'S THE WAY OF YOU THAT'S THE ROAD YOU'D ALL LIKE TO GO HEADLONG'S TO RUIN
2094-142345-0022 MISTER OMELEY'S INDEED
2094-142345-0023 YOU ARE A RAREIN FOR SITTING DOWN TO YOUR WORK A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THE TIME TO PUT BY
2094-142345-0024 MONEY MY IRONS TWIGHT TOLD PEAS PUT IT DOWN T WARM
2094-142345-0025 COLD IS IT MY DARLING BLESS YOUR SWEET VOICE
2094-142345-0026 SHE'S GOING TO PUT THE IRONING THINGS THERE
2094-142345-0027 MONEY I TUD LIKE TO DO INTO THE BARN TO TOMMY TO SEE THE WIDOWED
2094-142345-0028 NO NO YOU TOTTY'D GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON
2094-142345-0029 DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARD THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN UPON THE BLUE STREAM
2094-142345-0030 TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUSH AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
2094-142345-0031 AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU SO AUNT RACHEL
2094-142345-0032 I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN A SAME SORT OF WAY
2094-142345-0033 WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY SEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH AND YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO
2094-142345-0034 AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS OF SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TOWING AS IT ISN'T MADE UP
2094-142345-0035 BUT NOT MORE THAN WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE AUNTY SAID DINAH
2094-142345-0036 NAY DEAR FRIEND YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK AND THEIR FAMILIES
2094-142345-0037 WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR LOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE FITS US FOR IT AND CALLS US TO
2094-142345-0038 I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
2094-142345-0039 I'VE STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN AND ANYTHING I'VE DONE
2094-142345-0040 I DIDN'T PREACH IT WITHOUT DIRECTION
2094-142345-0041 DIRECTION HE
2094-142345-0042 I HAD A THOUSAND PATIENCE WITH YOU
2094-142345-0043 BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT WAS PLAIN HE MEANT TO COME IN
2094-142345-0044 NO SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY
2094-142345-0045 NOW SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0046 I DELIGHT IN YOUR KIT
2094-142345-0047 POYSER'S NOT AT HOME IS HE
2094-142345-0048 SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE OUT THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR
2094-142345-0049 NO SIR IT ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSITUR TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOOL
2094-142345-0050 BUT THERE'S FATHER IN THE BARN SIR IF YOU'D BE OF ANY USE
2094-142345-0051 NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WHELPS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE FOR THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD
2094-142345-0052 I MUST COME ANOTHER NIGHT AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES
2094-142345-0053 FOR IF HE'S ANYWHERE ON THIS FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE
2094-142345-0054 OH SIR CRIED MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
2094-142345-0055 BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO SIRE
2094-142345-0056 I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO RETURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
2094-142345-0057 I KNOW HIS FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THIS KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT
2094-142345-0058 BY THE BYE I I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0059 THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE EXPERIENCE OF HER DAIRY
2094-142345-0060 OR I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER
2300-131720-0000 THE PARIS PLANT LIKE THAT AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A MELANCHOLY EXHIBIT
2300-131720-0001 THE MOUNTAIN PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT
2300-131720-0002 THERE MESSRS JOHNSON AND HAMHER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
2300-131720-0003 THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST AND UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
2300-131720-0004 OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DRINK CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
2300-131720-0005 WHY IF WE ERECT A STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO PUT IT UP TO THE CITY
2300-131720-0006 THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE IT
2300-131720-0007 BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT COLLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE
2300-131720-0008 SOMETHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
2300-131720-0009 FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND A REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
2300-131720-0010 IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH IS EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
2300-131720-0011 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB THE GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARMHOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
2300-131720-0012 EDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT I COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALVANOMETER
2300-131720-0013 UNLESS WE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
2300-131720-0014 MISTER EDISON WAS A WRITER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
2300-131720-0015 HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY THAT
2300-131720-0016 THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE AT ALL TIMES
2300-131720-0017 EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING AT THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND
2300-131720-0018 HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY COULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
2300-131720-0019 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITIONS THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
2300-131720-0020 IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT APPLES TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
2300-131720-0021 THE THREE CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS
2300-131720-0022 MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
2300-131720-0023 I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STOOD UP
2300-131720-0024 BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST TREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
2300-131720-0025 THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF EDIFONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2300-131720-0026 THE ARK LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MUST BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
2300-131720-0027 EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS AND WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
2300-131720-0028 THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACTIVE REGISTRATION
2300-131720-0029 SINCE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
2300-131720-0030 THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METRE IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF THE ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
2300-131720-0031 ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENT TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERINGS AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
2300-131720-0032 THE STANDARD EDISON METER PRACTISE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOMS OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED
2300-131720-0033 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS AND THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH A METER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
2300-131720-0034 THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVISION BASIS
2300-131720-0035 IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METRE WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METER
2300-131720-0036 THE METRE CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
2300-131720-0037 HE WEIGHED AND RE WEIGHED THE METER PLAINS AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
2300-131720-0038 HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS EVERY KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
2300-131720-0039 THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED FOR
2300-131720-0040 WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATIONS THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART
2300-131720-0041 WE HAD METRE IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUIDS
237-126133-0000 HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS APPEARANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME
237-126133-0001 EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER THE PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
237-126133-0002 THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT COULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
237-126133-0003 ANYHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
237-126133-0004 IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE PHRONSIE FOR THIS ONE MOMENT
237-126133-0005 OR SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID VAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED
237-126133-0006 AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONIE
237-126133-0007 BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL PHRONSEY AND ALL
237-126133-0008 ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE TO LUCY'S OWN
237-126133-0009 NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED VAN AND SAY POLLY WON'T YOU
237-126133-0010 WELL YOU ARE THE DEAREST AND BEST MISTER KING I EVER SAW BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE MAMMY LET HER COME
237-126133-0011 ISN'T HE SPLENDID CRIED JASPER IN INTENSE PRIDE SWELLING UP AS FATHER KNEW HOW TO DO IT
237-126133-0012 THERE THERE HE SAID SOOTHINGLY PATTING HER BROWN FUZZY NECK
237-126133-0013 I YOU KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLLING HER SOBS I WON'T ONLY I CAN'T THANK YOU
237-126133-0014 ASKED PHRONSIE IN AN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE
237-126133-0015 YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONZIE
237-126133-0016 OH NO JAPS AND I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF
237-126133-0017 THERE JAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHEN THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE
237-126133-0018 DON'T MIND IT POLLYIE WHISPERED JASPER TWASN'T HER FAULT
237-126133-0019 DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE NOW
237-126133-0020 HOW DARED HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO
237-126133-0021 SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD APPRECIATE HER FATHER
237-126133-0022 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I KEPT IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY
237-126133-0023 HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JEST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
237-126133-0024 AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESSES THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
237-126133-0025 AT THE LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY
237-134493-0000 IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE GEORGE BERGSON DIED
237-134493-0001 HIS MOTHER NOW LIES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELDS
237-134493-0002 FROM THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHEQUER BOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHITE AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT
237-134493-0003 FROM THE GRAVEYARD GATE ONE CAN COUNT A THOUSAND GAILY PAINTED FARMHOUSES THE GILDED WEATHER VEINS ON THE BIG RED BARNS WINK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0004 THE AIR AND THE EARTH ARE CURIOUSLY PLANTED AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
237-134493-0005 HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY RED EYES DEEPLY SET UNDER A SERIOUS BROW
237-134493-0006 THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A JOB FOR AN ATHLETE YET I'VE BEEN TO TOWN AND BACK
237-134493-0007 ALEXANDRA LETS HIM SLEEP LATE
237-134493-0008 SHE GATHERED UP A REINS
237-134493-0009 PLEASE WAIT FOR ME MARIE AMILL COAXED
237-134493-0010 I NEVER SEE LOUGH'S SCYTHE OVER HERE

237-134493-0012 I GET WET TO MY KNEES WHEN I GO DOWN TO PLAY CHERRIES
237-134493-0013 INDEED HE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT SAYING IT
237-134493-0014 THEY THINK YOU'RE QUEER BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY TO SCHOOL OR SOMETHING
237-134493-0015 THERE WAS SOMETHING INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE GREAT THRONG A MOST UNUSUAL TRIMNESS AND CARE FOR DETAIL
237-134493-0016 ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A MILE BEFORE YOU REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL STOOD SMALL OSAGE ORANGE HEDGES THEIR GLOSSY GREEN MARKING OFF THE YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0017 ANY ONE THEREABOUTS WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FARMS ON THE DIVIDE AND THAT THE FARM WAS A WOMAN ALEXANDRA BERGSON
237-134493-0018 THERE IS EVEN A SIDE ROW OF BEE HIVES IN THE ORCHARD UNDER THE WALNUT TREES
237-134500-0000 FRANK READ ENGLISH SLOWLY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORCE CASE THE ANGRIER SHE GREW
237-134500-0001 MARIES SIGHED
237-134500-0002 A BRISK WIND HAD COME UP AND IT WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
237-134500-0003 THE CORRIDOR WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING IN THE SUN
237-134500-0004 THAT INVITATION DESTINED HER
237-134500-0005 OH BUT I'M GLAD TO GET THIS PLACE MOREED
237-134500-0006 JUST SMELL THOSE WILD ROSES THEY ARE ALWAYS SO SPICY AFTER A RAIN
237-134500-0007 WE NEVER HAD SO MANY OF THEM MEN IN HERE BEFORE
237-134500-0008 I SUPPOSE IT'S THE WET SEASON WILL YOU HAVE TO CUT THEM TO
237-134500-0009 I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE WET SEASON TOO THAT
237-134500-0010 IT'S TRYING TO SEE EVERYTHING GROWING SO FAST AND TO GET THE GRASS CUT
237-134500-0011 AREN'T YOU SPLASHED LOOK TO THE SPIDER WEBS ALL OVER THE GRASS
237-134500-0012 IN A FEW MOMENTS WE HEARD THE CHERRIES DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PAIL AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SCYTHE WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYS EVER LEARN
237-134500-0013 MARIE PICKED CHERRIES AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING BRANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE GOT A SHOWER OF RAIN DROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR
237-134500-0014 AND AMIMIL MOWED HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
237-134500-0015 THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MIGHTY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN SHABATA AND HIS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS
237-134500-0016 I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW LINDON'S IS
237-134500-0017 IF I FEEL THAT WAY I FEEL THE WAY
237-134500-0018 HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INSIPID FRUIT LONG IVORY COLOURED BERRIES TIPPED WITH FAINT PINK LIKE BLACK CORAL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDED ALL SUMMER THROUGH
237-134500-0019 HE BROUGHT A HANDFUL INTO HER LAP
237-134500-0020 YES WHY DON'T YOU
237-134500-0021 OH EVER SO MUCH ONLY HE SEEMS KIND OF STAID AND SCHOOL TEACHERD
237-134500-0022 WHEN SHE USED TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER SHE WASN'T A LITTLE IN LOVE WI HIM
237-134500-0023 IT WOULD SERVE YOU ALL RIGHT IF SHE WALKED OFF WITH KARL AND
237-134500-0024 I LIKE TO TALK TO KARL ABOUT NEW YORK AND WHATEVER A FELLOW CAN DO THERE
237-134500-0025 O AMILE
237-134500-0026 SURELY WE ARE NOT THINKING OF GOING OFF THERE
237-134500-0027 MARIE'S VOICE FELL UNDER HIS BROODING GAZE
237-134500-0028 I'M SURE ALEXANDRA HOPES YOU CAN STAY ON HERE SHE MURMURED
237-134500-0029 I DON'T WANT TO STAND AROUND AND LOOK AT
237-134500-0030 I WANT TO BE DOING SOMETHING ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT
237-134500-0031 SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO THROW THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A TABLECLOTH
237-134500-0032 WE GET TIRED OF SEEING MEN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN
237-134500-0033 I WISH YOU WEREN'T SO RESTLESS OR DIDN'T GET SO WORKED UP OVER THINGS SHE SAID SADLY
237-134500-0034 THANK YOU HE RESUMED SHORTLY
237-134500-0035 AND YOU NEVER USED TO BE CROSS OF ME
237-134500-0036 I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU LIKE A LITTLE BOY ANY MORE HE SAYS SLOWLY THAT'S WHAT YOU MISS MARIE
237-134500-0037 BUT AMOL IF I UNDERSTAND THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE
237-134500-0038 AND ANYHOW NOW THERE'S NOTHING TO UNDERSTAND
237-134500-0039 THAT WON'T LAST IT WILL COME AWAY AND THINGS WILL BE JUST AS THEY USED TO
237-134500-0040 I PRAY FOR YE BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAYED YOURSELF
237-134500-0041 I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DROWNED FOR IT
237-134500-0042 THIS ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER
260-123286-0000 SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA UNBROKEN ALL ROUND NO WIND IN SIGHT
260-123286-0001 THE HORIZON SEEMS EXTREMELY PLEASANT
260-123286-0002 ALL MY LABOR AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS SWAY
260-123286-0003 YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLES I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE ANXIOUS
260-123286-0004 ONE MIGHT BE WITH LESS REASON THAT NOW
260-123286-0005 I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE RATE WAS SLOW BUT THAT THE SEA IS SO WIDE
260-123286-0006 WE ARE LOSING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO GET A LITTLE SAIL UPON A POND ON A RAFT
260-123286-0007 HE CALLED THIS SEA A PAWN AND OUR LONG VOYAGE MAKING A LITTLE SAIL
260-123286-0008 THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT VIRTUES AND PROSPECTS
260-123286-0009 I CAN TAKE THIS AS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
260-123286-0010 SUNDAY AUGUST SIXTEENTH A
260-123286-0011 NOTHING NEW THEREFORE UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESHENS
260-123286-0012 BUT THERE SEEMED NO REASON OF CARE
260-123286-0013 THE SHADOW OF THE RAFTS WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
260-123286-0014 TRULY THE WAY IS OF INFINITE WIDTH
260-123286-0015 IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT THAT
260-123286-0016 THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALMED DOWN AFTER SEVERAL YEARS SLEEP
260-123286-0017 I SHUDDER AS I RECALL THEIR MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE
260-123286-0018 I SAW AT THE HAMBURG MUSEUM THE SKELETONS OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
260-123286-0019 I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PICKS HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE TO SIDE
260-123286-0020 TUESDAY AUGUST EIGHTYTH
260-123286-0021 DURING HIS WATCH I SWEPT
260-123286-0022 TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK AWOKE YOU
260-123286-0023 THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED BACK AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS
260-123286-0024 THERE'S A WHALE A WHALE CRIED THE PHILOSOPHER
260-123286-0025 FLIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REPTILES ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF AN EXPRESS TRAINS
260-123286-0026 TWO MONSTERS ONLY WERE CREATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO REPTILES OF THIS PRIMITIVE WORLD
260-123286-0027 I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF THE ICHTHEOSURUS GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT CO AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
260-123286-0028 ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING TO NATURALISTS IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO TEETH
260-123286-0029 THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACKED EACH OTHER WITH THE HIGHEST ANIMOSITY
260-123286-0030 SUDDENLY THE ICHTHYOSAURUS AND THE PLEBEOSAURUS DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WHIRLPOOL EDDYING IN THE WATER
260-123286-0031 AS TO THE ITHIOSAURUS HAS HE RETURNED TO HIS SUBMARINE CAVERN
260-123288-0000 THE ROARINGS ABOVE LOST IN THE DISTANCE
260-123288-0001 THE EARTH IF WE MAY USE THE TERM WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG
260-123288-0002 THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPORS AND PERVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SAILING WATERS
260-123288-0003 THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE THROUGH THE DENSE CURTAIN WHICH IS DROPPED OVER THE THEATER ON WHICH A BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
260-123288-0004 THE HOUR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS CALM
260-123288-0005 FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEECY TUFT OF MIST WITH YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPS DOWN UPON THE DENSE FLOORS OF GREY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OPAQUE AND IMPENETRABLE MASS
260-123288-0006 THE ATMOSPHERES IS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SURCHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY
260-123288-0007 THE WIND NEVER LULLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RESERVOIR OF FRIGHTFUL WINDY GUSTS AND RUSHING STORMS
260-123288-0008 THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I ADDED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON
260-123288-0009 THOSE FLOWERS SEEM AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEA
260-123288-0010 ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF A LAMANT AND SAINT OBEL'S FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF LEAD
260-123288-0011 BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH ON THE FIRST SHOCK OF A TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT
260-123288-0012 THAT'LL BE THE SAFEST NO NO NEVER
260-123288-0013 THE PILED UP VAPOURS CONDENSED INTO WATER AND THE AIR PUT INTO VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACUUM LEFT BY THE CONDENSATIONS OF THE MISTS ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0014 HANS STIRES NOT
260-123288-0015 FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL EMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS AT CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLECULES THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
260-123288-0016 I REFERS TO THE THERMOMETER IT INDICATES THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED
260-123288-0017 IS THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED ITS DENSITY TO BECOME PERSONAL
260-123288-0018 THE RAFT BEARS UPON STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
260-123288-0019 AT NOON WHEN THE VIOLENCE OF THE STORM REDOUBLES
260-123288-0020 EITHER OF US IS LASHED TO SOME PART OF THE RAFT
260-123288-0021 THE WAVES RISE ABOVE OUR SIDES
260-123288-0022 THEY SEEM TO BE WE ARE LOST FOR I AM NOT SURE
260-123288-0023 HE NODS THE CONSENT
260-123288-0024 THE FIRE BALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN INCH SHELL MOVED SLOWLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING IN ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0025 HERE IT COMES THERE IT GLIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THENCE IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZINE' HORRIBLE
260-123288-0026 WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLY LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHES HANS WHO FIXES HIS BLUE EYE UPON IT STEADILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF HIS UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
260-123288-0027 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NITROGEN FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE ROAD IT FILLS THE LUNGS
260-123288-0028 WE' SUFFER STIFLING PAINS
260-123440-0000 AND HOW ODD THE MORNINGS WILL LOOK
260-123440-0001 POOR HONEST
260-123440-0002 IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WITH A PAIR OF WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGER FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG IN A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUCHESS THE DUCHESS
260-123440-0003 AND WON'T SHE BE SAVAGE IF I'VE KEPT HER WAITING
260-123440-0004 ALICE TOOK UP THE FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR HOW QUICK EVERYTHING IS TO DAY
260-123440-0005 AND YESTERDAY THINGS WENT UP JUST AS USUAL
260-123440-0006 I WONDER IF I'V BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
260-123440-0007 I ALMOST THINK I CANNOT REMEMBER FEELING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
260-123440-0008 I'LL TRY IF I KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO
260-123440-0009 I SHALL NEVER GET TO THE TWENTY AT THAT RATE
260-123440-0010 HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAW
260-123440-0011 NO I'VE MADE UP MY MINDS ABOUT IT IF I'M MABEL I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
260-123440-0012 IT'LL BE NO USE THEIR PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME BACK AGAIN DEAR
260-123440-0013 I AM SO VERY TIRED OF GOING ALL ALONE HERE
260-123440-0014 AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD THAT IT DOES
260-123440-0015 I WISH YOU HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
260-123440-0016 I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN CLOTHES
260-123440-0017 THAT WILL BE A POOR THING TO BE SURE
260-123440-0018 AND I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE OH MOUSE
260-123440-0019 CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST NOT BE REALLY OFFENDED
260-123440-0020 WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE KNOW
2830-3979-0000 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE REAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAM LANGUAGE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0002 LET US BEGIN WITH THAT OF HIS COMMENTARY ON GALATIONS
2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A SOLITARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
2830-3979-0004 IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN THEN
2830-3979-0005 THE WORK HAD NOT TO BE CONDENSED
2830-3979-0006 A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ONGDULATIONS
2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS OWN CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GALLATIONS FOR INSTANCE
2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND ROER PREPARED THE MAGAZINE FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THIS SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE
2830-3979-0010 BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS NEVER
2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO BE LUKE TWO
2830-3979-0012 THE WORD OF MY GOD SHALL STAND FOR EVER
2830-3980-0000 IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT POL
2830-3980-0001 THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PEOPLE
2830-3980-0002 HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO QUESTION
2830-3980-0003 PAUL CAME LATER AND HAS BENEATH US
2830-3980-0004 INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FROM A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0005 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHARGE
2830-3980-0006 AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY FOR MINISTRY
2830-3980-0007 AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONOURED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT THIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
2830-3980-0008 PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009 PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN E ET CETERA
2830-3980-0010 EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS APOSTLES
2830-3980-0011 PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY HIM NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0012 THE MOST THEY COULD COMPLAIN IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013 HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE ACQUAINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
2830-3980-0014 THE CALM IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
2830-3980-0015 FOR A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE
2830-3980-0016 IT SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK IT
2830-3980-0017 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS MONEY
2830-3980-0018 I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE INFLUENCE OF THE MINISTRY
2830-3980-0019 I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD HIS SPIRITUAL BOASTING
2830-3980-0020 THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS HOLY BRIDE
2830-3980-0021 AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED IT FROM THE DEAD
2830-3980-0022 THE CLAUCH SEEMED SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0023 THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST REJECT THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
2830-3980-0024 IN THIS WHOLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF THE CHRIST
2830-3980-0025 BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL FAITH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0026 TO FIRST TWO
2830-3980-0027 AND ALL THE BRETHREN WHICH ARE WITHIN ME
2830-3980-0028 THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THESE FALSE APOSTLES
2830-3980-0029 ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND SEEK AS I DO
2830-3980-0030 THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINANT THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE
2830-3980-0031 WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GOD LIKE PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0032 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF A MAN
2830-3980-0033 NOT ALL THE GALLAATIONS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
2830-3980-0034 ALL THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED
2830-3980-0035 THEY REMAINED DIVINELY REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
2830-3980-0036 WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNING THERE
2830-3980-0037 SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE FIVE
2830-3980-0038 GRACE BUT TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0039 THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND THEY ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2830-3980-0040 THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS A REFRESHING
2830-3980-0041 GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE OR A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042 THE WORLD BRANDS US A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
2830-3980-0043 ALL EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
2830-3980-0044 HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL I
2830-3980-0045 MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF GOD
2830-3980-0046 WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAVE THEM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0047 TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MASTER AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0048 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON IT
2830-3980-0049 EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET NOT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0050 DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO A FATHER BUT BY ME
2830-3980-0051 WHEN YOU ARGUE OF THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
2830-3980-0052 WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS THE DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053 AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS YOUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0054 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE MOTHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
2830-3980-0055 TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PERFORMANCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
2830-3980-0056 OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM THE LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0057 THE PARIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
2830-3980-0058 MUHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0059 PAUL STICKS TO HIS THEM
2830-3980-0060 BUT HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLE
2830-3980-0061 NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASCHER LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062 NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR FOR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0063 I UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES
2830-3980-0064 HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF MY SINS
2830-3980-0065 PAUL ANSWERS TO THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0066 SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY MAY NOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
2830-3980-0067 THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NEVER MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
2830-3980-0068 THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES US
2830-3980-0069 THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR THEIR SINS
2830-3980-0070 BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF THINGS
2830-3980-0071 WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SINS
2830-3980-0072 THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACTS THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
2830-3980-0073 THE ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0074 THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED ON THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
2830-3980-0075 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THESE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0076 ON THE OTHER HAND WE OUGHT NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
2961-960-0000 HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MEN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES USED IN A FLUX OF SENSE
2961-960-0001 THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTAND
2961-960-0002 IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEOPLATINISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS IN CONNEXIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO
2961-960-0003 THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NATURE WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
2961-960-0004 THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLEN INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEOPLATINISTS
2961-960-0005 IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED TO HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
2961-960-0006 THE FANCIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURY OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
2961-960-0007 BUT THEY WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0008 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONTINUED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
2961-960-0009 THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERMS THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
2961-960-0010 BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE COULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
2961-960-0011 WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE AN EXAGGERAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
2961-960-0012 MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THAT TIMAEUS
2961-960-0013 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIMSELF AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
2961-960-0014 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISH
2961-960-0015 THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE TATONIC DIALOGUES
2961-960-0016 BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENTS WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE FIBRES OR SYMPOSIUM
2961-960-0017 NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH SHE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
2961-960-0018 BUT AT THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
2961-960-0019 HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE AND NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAS NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
2961-960-0020 AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORTS OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS
2961-960-0021 THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURED AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIER WRITINGS
2961-960-0022 PLATO HAD NOT THIS COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
2961-961-0000 SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSITION
2961-961-0001 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
2961-961-0002 AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIAS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISGRACE
2961-961-0003 I WILL IF TIMAEUS APPROVES I RECEIVE
2961-961-0004 LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SOLON WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF TROPIDUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME
2961-961-0005 SOME POEMS OF SALINE WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
2961-961-0006 AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POLE SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
2961-961-0007 A SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
2961-961-0008 BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ASTERS
2961-961-0009 TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SELLEN HEARD THAT STORY
2961-961-0010 FOR IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOREVER IN OUR TEMPLES
2961-961-0011 THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNALS SOLON ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY
2961-961-0012 FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF THE HEAVEN
2961-961-0013 SELLE MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
2961-961-0014 NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED OURS AS OUR ANNALS RECORD IT
2961-961-0015 MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF HERS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME
2961-961-0016 I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THAT SACRED REGISTERS
2961-961-0017 OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE THE LAW TOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING AFTER THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN
2961-961-0018 THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF AN ISLAND OF ATLANTIS
2961-961-0019 FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE OTHER HELLENE HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS
2961-961-0020 THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE GIGANTIC OCEAN
2961-961-0021 BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO CHERISH MY MEMORY
2961-961-0022 THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM IT HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORDS SPOKE
3570-5694-0000 BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE LIFE SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM
3570-5694-0001 THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF GROWTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH
3570-5694-0002 SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTLY TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULLNESS OF LIFE
3570-5694-0003 WITH THE FURTHER ADVANCED IN CULTURE THIS TABOO MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABOO OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
3570-5694-0004 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE MEASURE CLASS
3570-5694-0005 UNDER THE TABOO CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE ALTOGETHER CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS
3570-5694-0006 DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AND BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
3570-5694-0007 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS IN THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
3570-5694-0008 THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTLY TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
3570-5694-0009 WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MOST QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
3570-5694-0010 THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS IN HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL
3570-5694-0011 THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THAT LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
3570-5694-0012 THERE IS THE MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK IN GRATES
3570-5694-0013 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE AND GENTILITY
3570-5694-0014 MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS
3570-5694-0015 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS WITHOUT QUALIFICATIONS
3570-5694-0016 MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF VICARIOUS CONSUMERS IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
3570-5694-0017 THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIVE
3570-5694-0018 THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE REAL AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
3570-5694-0019 BUT THE GREATER DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
3570-5694-0020 SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE IMPORTANT SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS
3570-5694-0021 WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THIS MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONORIFIC CHARACTER
3570-5694-0022 THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL YOU ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
3570-5695-0000 IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE FOUR GROUPS COINCIDE
3570-5695-0001 THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS FOR WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
3570-5695-0002 BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS SUDDENLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
3570-5695-0003 IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POSITION IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
3570-5695-0004 IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES THROUGH THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFECT
3570-5695-0005 THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FROM APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY
3570-5695-0006 VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKETS OR THE LAST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY
3570-5695-0007 THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SUPERIOR NEED
3570-5695-0008 THAT QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT
3570-5695-0009 EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES IN SOCIAL GROWTH
3570-5695-0010 THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BUT ANOTHER LINE
3570-5695-0011 IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH THE LEISURE
3570-5695-0012 IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION WAS GREATEST
3570-5695-0013 CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LOWER ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
3570-5695-0014 AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEIGHBOURHOOD GOSSIPS SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LAST GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE
3570-5695-0015 THE RESULT IS OF GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
3570-5696-0000 UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THIS FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
3570-5696-0001 BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE CORSEN PEACEABLE CULTURE
3570-5696-0002 OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOUR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF COMMON USE
3570-5696-0003 A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS EFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MANY INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMELIORATION EMBODIED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STYLE AND TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TORCHIS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
3570-5696-0004 THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC OFFICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
3570-5696-0005 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE REVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVICES ON HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUMER'S GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
3570-5696-0006 AS USED IN THEIR SPEECH OF EVERY DAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0007 THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONSPICUOUS EFFECT
3570-5696-0008 BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECIATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL
3570-5696-0009 IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF SIMPLICITY WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
3570-5696-0010 AN ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND HASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS
3575-170457-0000 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID THOUGH ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
3575-170457-0001 WHY ARE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY I
3575-170457-0002 I ARE WE TO BE DIVIDED
3575-170457-0003 SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE'RE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR THE IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
3575-170457-0004 WE USED TO DISPUTE ABOUT POLITICS AND TRADITION
3575-170457-0005 SHE A TORIAN CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN OUR HOUSE OF VIOLENT DESCENT IN RADICALISM
3575-170457-0006 HER FEEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE ANYONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR A STRUGGLE
3575-170457-0007 HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY AND TALKING THE BROADEST YORKSHIRE
3575-170457-0008 AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THAT CIRCLE OF VIOLENT RADICALS AND DISSENTERS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AND HONORED
3575-170457-0009 JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY OF SOUTHEY
3575-170457-0010 I AM NOT DEPRECIATING IT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE TIMES IT IS NOT RAIN
3575-170457-0011 BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINGUISH THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN HAPPINESS
3575-170457-0012 YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A DISCUSSION THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
3575-170457-0013 THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LESS LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EXCEPT AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
3575-170457-0014 TO THOSE PARTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR CELEBRITY
3575-170457-0015 BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARAGE THIS GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM EXERCISING IT I ONLY EXHORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCIVE TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD
3575-170457-0016 FAREWELL THEN MADAME
3575-170457-0017 THOUGH I MAY BE BUT AN UNGRACIOUS ADVISER YOU WILL ALLOW ME THEREFORE TO SUBSCRIBE MYSELF WITH THE BEST WISHES FOR YOUR HAPPINESS HERE AND HEREAFTER OUR TRUE FRIEND ROBERT SOUTHEY
3575-170457-0018 OUR MARCH SIXTEENTH
3575-170457-0019 I HAVE NOT VENTURED TO HOPE FOR SUCH A REPLY SO CONSIDERATE IN ITS TONE SO NOBLE IN ITS EXPRESSION
3575-170457-0020 I KNOW THE FIRST LETTER I WROTE TO YOU IS ALL SENSELESS TRASH FROM BEGINNING TO END BUT I AM NOT ALTOGETHER A IDLE DREAMING BEING IT WOULD SEEM TO DENOTE
3575-170457-0021 I THOUGHT IT THEREFORE MY DUTY WHEN I LEAVE SCHOOL TO BECOME A GOVERNESS
3575-170457-0022 IN THE EVENINGS I CONFESS I DO THINK BUT I NEVER TRUST ANY ONE ELSE WITH MY THOUGHTS
3575-170457-0023 I CAREFULLY AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PREOCCUPATION AND ECCENTRICITY WHICH MIGHT LEAD THOSE I LIVE AMONGST TO SUSPECT THE NATURE OF MY VISITS
3575-170457-0024 I DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED FOR SOMETIMES WHEN I'M PREACHING OR SEWING I WOULD RATHER BE READING OR WRITING BUT I TRY TO DENY MYSELF AND MY FATHER'S APPROBATION AMPLY REWARDED ME FOR THE PRIVATION
3575-170457-0025 AGAIN I THANK YOU THIS INCIDENT I SUPPOSE WILL BE RENEWED NO MORE IF I LIVE TO BE AN OLD WOMAN I SHALL REMEMBER IT THIRTY YEARS HENCE AS A BLACK DREAM
3575-170457-0026 P S PRAY SIR EXCUSE ME FOR WRITING TO YOU A SECOND TIME I COULD NOT HELP WRITING PARTLY TO TELL YOU HOW THANKFULLY I AM FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND PARTLY TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOUR ADVICE SHALL NOT BE WASTED HOWEVER SORROWFULLY AND RELUCTANTLY IT MAY BE AT FIRST FOLLOWED C B
3575-170457-0027 I I CANNOT DENY MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION OF INSERTING SOUTHEY'S REPLY
3575-170457-0028 KESWICK MARCH TWENTY SECOND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN DEAR MADAME
3575-170457-0029 YOUR LETTER HAS GIVEN ME GREAT PLEASURE AND I SHOULD NOT FORGIVE MYSELF IF I DARED NOT TELL YOU SO
3575-170457-0030 OF THIS SECOND LETTER HOWEVER SHE SPOKE AND TOLD ME THAT IT CONTAINED AN INVITATION FOR HER TO GO AND SEE THE POET IF EVER SHE VISITED THE LAKES
3575-170457-0031 FROM AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SHE WRITES
3575-170457-0032 COME TO I'M GETTING REALLY TIRED OF YOUR ABSENCE
3575-170457-0033 SATURDAY AFTER SATURDAY COMES AROUND AND I CAN HAVE NO HOPE OF HEARING YOUR KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND THEN BEING TOLD THAT MISS E IS GONE OH DEAR
3575-170457-0034 IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MAN THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
3575-170457-0035 I WISH IT WOULD RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS THE ESTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR OFF
3575-170457-0036 MY EYES FILL WITH TEARS WHEN I CONTRAST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE THIS BRIGHTENED MY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WANDERING IN THOUGHT AND DEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SMITTEN AT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT GHASTLY CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ARE TRUE DARKENED IN SHORT BY THE VERY SHADOWS OF SPIRITUAL DEATH
3575-170457-0037 IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I CAN NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOT BED FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON AN ACTION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REDEEMER FOR DIRECTION
3575-170457-0038 AND MEANTIME I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JEHOVAH I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY RIGHT
3575-170457-0039 THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THEIR PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELLED UP MORE OR LESS
3575-170457-0040 INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT APPROACHING THE SAME RESULT
3575-170457-0041 SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ERRAND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE DEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON THE ICE AND SHE FELL IT WAS DARK AND NO ONE SAW HER MISCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSER BY
3575-170457-0042 UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACTURE CANNOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT OUR HOUSE IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND DANGEROUS STATE
3575-170457-0043 HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD CONDEMNED THE MATTER TO A HIGHER DECISION THAN OURS AND THAT YOU WERE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT AND MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST
3575-170457-0044 AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENTS OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
3575-170457-0045 I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF SO INTIMATE SOCIETY
3575-170457-0046 A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BRONTEES A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHIRE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGGIST SHOP IN HAWORTH FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE IN EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTOR AND NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLDS ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBY'S FRACTURED LEGS
3575-170457-0047 TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND HE WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
3575-170457-0048 HE REFUSED AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THIS CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
3575-170457-0049 THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE POLICE
3575-170457-0050 TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND ONE OTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY AND AGE
3575-170457-0051 AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SAT AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT AWAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
3575-170457-0052 SHE HAD ANOTHER THOUGHT ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
3575-170457-0053 BUT ANNE HAD BEGUN TO SUFFER JUST BEFORE HER HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCHED OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG
3575-170457-0054 STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR HIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRAIDED MISS WOOD FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO ANNE'S STATE OF HEALTH
3575-170457-0055 STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLLOWS SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FOND ANXIETY WHICH IS SO FULL OF SUDDEN PANGS OF FEAR
3575-170457-0056 I DOUBT WHETHER BRANWELL HAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
3729-6852-0000 TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HIS SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3729-6852-0001 WITHOUT SINGING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
3729-6852-0002 IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBE CONTI AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TEN LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
3729-6852-0003 MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR MY PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SKEVERA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SKURRYA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
3729-6852-0004 HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA FOR IT INSPIRED EVERY ONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE IS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
3729-6852-0005 SILVIA WAS THE ADORATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MARINVAUX FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMEDIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO POSTERITY
3729-6852-0006 SILVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HER SELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY SUPERIORITY TOWARDS HER THEATRICAL SISTERS ALTHOUGH SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TALENT OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THE VIRTUE
3729-6852-0007 TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARIANNE IN THE COMEDY OF MARIBOUX AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
3729-6852-0008 SHE WAS HONOURABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT SAUVERT WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTI CHRISTIAN INTOLERANCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOUR OF ALL MANKIND
3729-6852-0009 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SYLVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SIVIA DIES
3729-6852-0010 BUT I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
3729-6852-0011 I GOT A NAME I BELIEVE IN MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
3729-6852-0012 I SHALL CALL YOU ESPREE
3729-6852-0013 YOU DON ME A GREAT HONOR
3729-6852-0014 HERE GO AND GOT ME CHANGE FOR A LOUIS I HAVE IT SIR
3729-6852-0015 AT YOUR SERVICE SON
3729-6852-0016 MADAME QUINSON BESIDES CAN ANSWER YOUR DIFFICULTIES
3729-6852-0017 I SEE A QUANTITY OF CHAIRS FOR HIRE AT THE RATE OF ONE SOUS MEN READING THE NEWSPAPERS UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES GIRLS AND MEN BREAKFASTING EITHER ALONE OR IN COMPANY WAITERS WHO ARE RAPIDLY GOING UP AND DOWN A NARROW STAIR CASE HIDDEN UNDER THE FOLIAGE
3729-6852-0018 I SIT DOWN AT THE SMALL TABLE A WAITER COMES IMMEDIATELY TO ENQUIRE MY WISHES
3729-6852-0019 I TELL HIM TO MAKE ME SOME COFFEE IF IT IS GOOD
3729-6852-0020 THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COURT TO THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0021 I THEN THANK HIM AND TAKE MY LEAVE
3729-6852-0022 I ADDRESS HIM IN THE ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WITTILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
3729-6852-0023 MY WORK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
3729-6852-0024 I SEE A CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GROUND EVERYBODY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
3729-6852-0025 FOR IS THERE NOT A MERIDIAN EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0026 YES BY THE MERIDIAN OF THE PALAIS ROYAL IS THE MOST EXACT
3729-6852-0027 THAT IS TRUE BAD DILT GRIE
3729-6852-0028 ALL THESE HONEST GENTLEMEN ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FILLED
3729-6852-0029 IT IS SOLD EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE CEVETTE CATT
3729-6852-0030 IS IT A BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
3729-6852-0031 BUT HOW DID SHE MANAGE TO RENDER IT MORE FASHIONABLE
3729-6852-0032 SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HER SNUFF BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HER SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
3729-6852-0033 YOU ARE NOW IN THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR A FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVES THE WELCOME OF INTELLIGENT AND TALENTED PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT FOR SILLINESS IS TRULY A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PEOPLE HERE AND HOWEVER DREADFUL IT MAY APPEAR SILLINESS IS THE DAUGHTER OF WIT
3729-6852-0034 LET A MAN RUN IN EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MAD BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE
3729-6852-0035 IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH APPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ET CETERA IS RATHER A PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THIS AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM INFALLIBLE
3729-6852-0036 WHEN THE KING COMES TO PARIS EVERYBODY CALLS OUT VIVE LE ROE
3729-6852-0037 SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING ANY ONE OF THEM
3729-6852-0038 IT SIR I SAID TO HIM AM I FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
3729-6852-0039 HE HIMSELF RECITED THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT WE HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
3729-6852-0040 FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE THE RAPID PROGRESS
3729-6852-0041 I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR MYSELF THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
3729-6852-0042 I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INSATIABLE AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULD MEET WITH THAT TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY HIM
3729-6852-0043 I RESIDED IN THE MARAIS RUE DES DUPORT
3729-6852-0044 I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FRENCH AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF THEIR FINDING YOU INSATIABLE
3729-6852-0045 HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GREAT STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY REPARTEES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANY ONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
3729-6852-0046 HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYBODY SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
4077-13751-0000 ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS WAS FORMERLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK UP A LEGAL EXISTENCE
4077-13751-0001 ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEED AND HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
4077-13751-0002 INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY AFFILIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORES OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TODAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
4077-13751-0003 IN PLACE OF A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGREGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OF ZION AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WARDS EACH WARD OR STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLEMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRIESTHOOD ORGANIZATIONS
4077-13751-0004 THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ITS PROSELYTES INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BUILDING UP AND STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOM MET WITH ABROAD AND VERY ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
4077-13751-0005 NEVERTHELESS THE MUSTARD SEED AMONG THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEDS HAS ATTAINED THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW AN OAK OFFERING PROTECTION AND THE SWEETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY EARNEST PILGRIM JOURNEYING ITS WAY IN TRUTH
4077-13751-0006 THE EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARDS THE EVENING SUN NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSELYTING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED
4077-13751-0007 THE BOOK O MORMON HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TOWARD THIS DARK SKINNED REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMONISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH THEIR EYES WENT TO THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
4077-13751-0008 IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THE RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS WITH FAVOUR SEEING IN THE BOOK O' ORMON STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
4077-13751-0009 THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF KURETLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE ERIE AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
4077-13751-0010 TO THE FERVENT LETTER DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR A RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
4077-13751-0011 SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES IN MISSOURI INDEPENDENTLY JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISSOURIANS
4077-13751-0012 THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LILBURN W BOGGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MORMON HATER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TRIALS HE MANIFESTS HIS SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTORS
4077-13751-0013 THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FITLY CHRONICLED WITH HUMAN SCRIBE
4077-13751-0014 MAKING HIS WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEES FOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN CAULDWELL COUNTY THEREIN FOUNDING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
4077-13751-0015 A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON FAMILIES ON SHOAL CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPLESS SETTLERS AND BUTCHERED A SCORE
4077-13751-0016 BE IT SAID TO THE HONOUR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH A TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNT ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGNED THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
4077-13751-0017 OH WHAT A TREASURE TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT
4077-13751-0018 AMERICAN SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ABBAYNZES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH THE PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE VAUDOIS HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF THE ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE
4077-13751-0019 WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS THERE THE MORMONS
4077-13751-0020 AS A SAMPLE OF THE PRESSING COMMENTS AGAINST THE BRUTALITY OF THE MISSOURIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
4077-13751-0021 IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISSOURI WITH GOVERNOR BOGGS AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INCITED FOR IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVES OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE
4077-13754-0000 THAT ARMY FOUND THE PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND LEFT THEM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
4077-13754-0001 BUT THE WORD FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL
4077-13754-0002 IT WAS THROUGH FLOYD'S ADVICE THAT BUCHANAN ORDERED THEIR MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH OSTENSIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN ALLEGED INFANTILE REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THE SECESSIONISTS
4077-13754-0003 MOREOVER HAD THE WOMEN BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHAT GREATER OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISHED
4077-13754-0004 REALLY A NORTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF WHY NOT SET UP ALSO A WEST
4077-13754-0005 THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH NO EAST NO WEST THEY STOOD POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN IN ARMS FOR THEIR COUNTRY'S NEED
4077-13754-0006 WHAT THE LATTER DAY SAINTS CALLED CELESTIAL MARRIAGE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTISE BUT OF CELESTIAL MARRIAGE PLURALITY OF WIVES WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
4077-13754-0007 WE BELIEVE IN A LITERAL RESURRECTION AS AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATE SHALL BE RECOGNISED EVERY SANCTIFIED AND AUTHORIZED RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
4077-13754-0008 IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE AND I HAVE YET TO FIND THE PLACE AND MEET THE PEOPLE WHEREIN WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE MALIGNED MORMONS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST
4077-13754-0009 TO THE INCEPTION OF PLURAL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTICE
4077-13754-0010 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS ENACTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING PLURAL MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRIOR TO THEIR PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER
4077-13754-0011 FEDERAL JUDGES OR UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS IN UTAH WHO WERE NOT MORMONS NOR LOVERS OF MORMONISM REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN COMPLAINTS OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND INADEQUACY
4077-13754-0012 THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISDEMEANOUR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE AYE FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COUNT'S POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTEND SO FAR AND MIGHT BE FINED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
4077-13754-0013 BEFORE THIS TRAVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THERE MET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT DESERVED MEN WERE IMPRISONED UNDER SENTENCE OF THREE YEARS DURATION
4077-13754-0014 THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE A DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE
4077-13754-0015 THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND INITIATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THIS PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL ESTATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY
4077-13754-0016 AND SO THE STORY OF MORMONISM RUNS ON ITS FINALE HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE CURRENT PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPS OF ITS PLAN
4446-2271-0000 MAINCALL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0001 HE HAD PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT WE SHOULD BE ENGINEERS OR MECHANICS
4446-2271-0002 IT'S TREMENDOUSLY WELL PUT ON SO
4446-2271-0003 IT'S BEEN ON ONLY TWO WEEKS THAT I'VE BEEN HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY
4446-2271-0004 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MADHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISMS SERIOUSLY MYSELF
4446-2271-0005 SHE SAVES HER HAND TOO SHE'S AT HER BEST AT THE SECOND ACT
4446-2271-0006 HE'S BEEN WANTING TO MARRY HILDA THESE THREE WEEKS AND MORE
4446-2271-0007 SHE DOESN'T TAKE UP WITH ANYBODY YOU
4446-2271-0008 IRENE BURGOYNE SOME OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
4446-2271-0009 MAINHALL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF PROUD EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
4446-2271-0010 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT OUR LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
4446-2271-0011 SIR HARRY TOWNE MISTER BARTLEY ELEANOR THE AMERICAN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0012 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TODAY ISN'T SHE
4446-2271-0013 YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE A BIT CONSCIOUS TON NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME
4446-2271-0014 WESTMERE AND I ARE BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
4446-2271-0015 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY AND
4446-2271-0016 HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A KEEN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WIND THROUGH A HILLY FIELD
4446-2271-0017 ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WINIFRED WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD HER THAT THING HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
4446-2271-0018 SHE CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT THO I AM GLAD YOU ASK ME
4446-2271-0019 AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO THINK
4446-2271-0020 OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY AND SENSIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY OLD AND DAFT
4446-2271-0021 SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THE THEATRE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE WISHED TO
4446-2271-0022 I'M GLAD SHE'S HALF HER OWN SINCE
4446-2271-0023 AFTER ALL WE WERE AWFULLY LONG
4446-2271-0024 I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT IN ME NOW
4446-2273-0000 HILDA WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HER CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVOUSLY OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR
4446-2273-0001 THEY ASKED HIM TO COME TO SEE THEM IN CHELSEA AND THEY SPOKE VERY TENDERLY OF LILDA
4446-2273-0002 LAMB WOULDN'T CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MANY OF US I FANCY
4446-2273-0003 WHEN BARTLEY ARRIVED AT BEDFORD SQUARE ON SUNDAY EVENING MARIE THE PRETTY LITTLE FRENCH GIRL MET HIM AT A DOOR AND CONDUCTED HIM UP STAIRS
4446-2273-0004 I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF MOLLY HAD BEEN HERE FOR I REMEMBER YOU DON'T LIKE ENGLISH COOKY
4446-2273-0005 I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE YET TO TELL YOU WHAT A CHARMING LITTLE PLACE I THINK THIS IS
4446-2273-0006 THEY ARE ALL SKETCHES MADE ABOUT THE VILLADESTIS YOU SEE
4446-2273-0007 THOSE FELLOWS ARE ALL VERY LOYAL EVEN MAINLY HALL
4446-2273-0008 I'VE MANAGED TO SAVE SOMETHING EVERY YEAR AND THAT WITH HELPING MY THREE SISTERS NOW AND THEN AND TILDYING POOR COUSIN MIKE OVER BAD SEASONS
4446-2273-0009 IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY FAIR SHE SAID BUT SOME OF IT WAS MY MOTHER'S
4446-2273-0010 THERE WAS THE WATERCRESS SOUP AND SOLE AND A DELIGHTFUL OMELETTE STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS AND TRUFFLES AND TWO SMALL RARE DUCKLINGS AND ARTICHOKES AND A DRY YELLOW ROAN WINE OF WHICH BARTLEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND
4446-2273-0011 THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT LOOKS TOO JOLLY
4446-2273-0012 THANK YOU BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT SO WELL AS THIS
4446-2273-0013 AND HAVE YOU BEEN IN PARIS MUCH THESE LATE YEARS
4446-2273-0014 THERE ARE A FEW CHANCES IN THE OLD QUARTER
4446-2273-0015 DON'T I THOUGH I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR IT HOW DID YOUR WIFE TURN OUT
4446-2273-0016 HER HAIR IS STILL LIKE FLAX AND HER BLUE EYES ARE JUST LIKE A BABY'S AND SHE HAS THE SAME THREE FRECKLES ON HER LITTLE NOSE AND TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO HER BE DES MERES
4446-2273-0017 HOW JOLLY IT WAS BEING YOUNG HIL

4446-2273-0019 COME WE'LL HAVE OUR COFFEE IN THE OTHER ROOM AND YE CAN SMOKE
4446-2273-0020 I DO THINK WE DID SHE ANSWERED DEMURELY
4446-2273-0021 WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US WAS NEITHER OUR FLOWERS NOR OUR TREES BUT JUST OUR YOUTH
4446-2273-0022 THEY WAS BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE
4446-2273-0023 THE STRANGE WOMAN AND HER PASSIONATE SENTENCE THAT RANG OUT SO SHARPLY HAD STRICKEN THEM BOTH
4446-2273-0024 BARTLEY STARTED WHEN HILDA RANG THE LITTLE BELL BESIDE HER DEAR ME WHAT DID YOU DO THAT
4446-2273-0025 IT WERE VERY JOLLY HE MURMURED LAZILY AS MARIE CAME IN TO TAKE AWAY THE COFFEE
4446-2273-0026 HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY REAL PLAY
4446-2273-0027 WHEN SHE FINISHED ALEXANDER SHOOK HIMSELF OUT OF THEIR REVERIE
4446-2273-0028 NONSENSE OF COURSE I CAN'T REALLY SING UP THE WAY MY MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER DID BEFORE ME
4446-2273-0029 IT'S REALLY TOO WARM IN THIS ROOM TO SWIM DON'T YOU FEEL IT
4446-2273-0030 ALEXANDER WENT OVER AND OPENED THE WINDOW FOR THE
4446-2273-0031 BUT THERE JUST IN FRONT
4446-2273-0032 HE STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND HER AND TRIED TO STEADY HIMSELF AS HE SAID IT'S SOFT AND MISTY SEE HOW QUIET THE STARS ARE
4446-2273-0033 FOR A LONG TIME NEITHER HILDA NOR BOTLEY SPOKE
4446-2273-0034 HE FELT A TREMOR RUN THROUGH THE SLENDER DARK FIGURE IN FRONT OF HIM
4446-2273-0035 CHARTLEY LEANED OVER HER SHOULDER WITHOUT TOUCHING HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR YOU ARE GIVING ME A CHANCE YES
4446-2273-0036 ALEXANDER CLENCHED THE OTHER HANDS AT HIS SIDES
4446-2275-0000 THE STOP AT QUEENSTOWN THE TEDIOUS PASSAGE UP THE MERCY WERE THINGS THAT HE NOTED GRIMLY THROUGH HIS GROWING IMPATIENCE
4446-2275-0001 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD INTO HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
4446-2275-0002 ALEXANDER PACED UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAY BUTTONING AND UNBUTTONING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO HILMA'S LIVING ROOM
4446-2275-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE RETURNED
4446-2275-0004 ALEXANDER DID NOT SIT DOWN THERE
4446-2275-0005 I FELT IT IN MY BONES WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING BUT SOMETHING SPLENDID WAS GOING TO TURN UP
4446-2275-0006 I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE MY SISTER KATE OR COUSIN MIKE WOULD BE HAPPENING ALONG
4446-2275-0007 SHE PUSHED HIM TOWARD THE BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEARTH HER KNEES DRAWN UP TO THE CHIN LAUGHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL
4446-2275-0008 WHEN DID YOU GET BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
4446-2275-0009 I GOT IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AGO
4446-2275-0010 ALEXANDER LEANED FORWARD AND WARMED HIS HANDS BEFORE THAT BLAZE
4446-2275-0011 BARTLAND BENT LOWERED OVER THE FIRE
4446-2275-0012 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED NECK THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
4446-2275-0013 I'LL DO ANY THING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
4446-2275-0014 I CAN'T STAND SEEING US MISERABLE
4446-2275-0015 HE PICKED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
4446-2275-0016 HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM THE CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES AT
4446-2275-0017 BUT IT'S WARM NOW IT'S UNBEARABLE
4446-2275-0018 I SHALL GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
4446-2275-0019 THAT WORLD IS ALL THERE JUST AS IT USED TO BE BUT I CAN'T GET AT IT ANY MORE
4446-2275-0020 IT WAS FOR MYSELF I WAS DEFYING HILDA
4446-2275-0021 HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK HE MUST HAVE BEEN
4446-2275-0022 BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT YOU WERE HERE IN THE SUMMER
4446-2275-0023 ALEXANDER GROANED I HAD MEANT TO BUT SOMEHOW I COULDN'T
4446-2275-0024 SHE PRESSED HIS HAIR GENTLY IN GRATITUDE
4446-2275-0025 WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN IN ALL
4446-2275-0026 SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH AS IF TO DRAW IN AGAIN THE FRAGRANCE OF THOSE PLACES
4446-2275-0027 HE MOVED UNEASILY AND HIS TAIL CREAKED
4446-2275-0028 YES YES SHE HURRIED THROWING HER HAND GENTLY AWAY FROM HIM
4446-2275-0029 PLEASE TELL ME ONE THING BARTLEY AT LEAST TELL ME THAT YOU BELIEVE I THOUGHT HE WAS MAKING YOU HAPPY
4446-2275-0030 YES HILDA I SEE THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
4446-2275-0031 I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY IT WAS WRONG
4446-2275-0032 IF I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'VE ONLY TO TELL ME NOW
4446-2275-0033 WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I WANT YOU TO PROMISE NEVER TO SEE ME AGAIN NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I COME NO MATTER HOW HARD I BEG IT
4446-2275-0034 KEEP AWAY IF YOU WISH WHEN HAVE I EVER FINISHED YOU
4446-2275-0035 ALEXANDER ROSE AND SHOOK HIMSELF ANGRILY YES I KNEW I'M COWARDLY
4446-2275-0036 HE TOOK HER ROUGHLY IN HIS ARMS DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
4446-2275-0037 OH BETLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
4446-2275-0038 I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLY BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
4446-2275-0039 I MUST SAY ABOUT YOU
4446-2275-0040 THE SIGHT OF YOU BARTLIE TO SEE YOU LIVING AND HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL CAN I NEVER MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME
4446-2275-0041 YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU IT MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
4446-2275-0042 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH IF IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
4446-2275-0043 BARTLEY BENT OVER AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS KISSING HER MOUTH AND HER WET TIRED ARMS
4446-2275-0044 WELL DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
4446-2275-0045 WE'RE TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TO NIGHT
4507-16021-0000 CHAPTER ONE OUR ORIGIN
4507-16021-0001 IT ENGENDERS A WHOLE WORLD LA PEGUERE FOR WHICH RED THEFT AND A HELL LA PEGRINE FOR WHICH RED HUNGER
4507-16021-0002 THUS EVILNESS IS THE MOTHER
4507-16021-0003 SHE HAS A SON FROM THEFT AND A DAUGHTER HUNGER
4507-16021-0004 HOW IS SLANG
4507-16021-0005 WE HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THIS SORT OF OBLIGATIONS
4507-16021-0006 SLANG IS ODIOUS TO
4507-16021-0007 SLANG MAKES ONE SUFFER
4507-16021-0008 BUT DENIES THAT OF COURSE IT DOES
4507-16021-0009 WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF PROBING A WOUND A GULF A SOCIETY SINCE WHEN HAS IT BEEN CONSIDERED WRONG TO GO TOO FAR TO GO TO A BOTTOM
4507-16021-0010 WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST A SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH DUTY ACCEPTED WHEN FULFILLED MERITS
4507-16021-0011 WHY SHOULD ONE NEVER EXPLORE EVERYTHING AND STUDY EVERYTHING
4507-16021-0012 WHY SHOULD ONE HUNT ON THE WAY
4507-16021-0013 NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE PROBABLE SWARMING OF SLANG
4507-16021-0014 NOW WHEN HAS HORROR EVER EXCLUDED STUDYING
4507-16021-0015 SINCE WHEN HAS MALADY BANISHED MEDICINE AND
4507-16021-0016 CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIPER THE BAT THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDES THE TARANTULA AND ONE WHO WOULD CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT IS
4507-16021-0017 HE WOULD BE LIKE A PHILOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PROFESSOR HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
4507-16021-0018 WHAT IS THAT SLANG PROPERLY SPEAKING
4507-16021-0019 IT IS THE LANGUAGE OF NATURALNESS
4507-16021-0020 WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACTS MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ATTENUATING IT WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALL TRADES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND ALL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE THEIR OWN SLANG
4507-16021-0021 THE PAINTER WHO SAYS MY GRINDER THE NOTARY WHO SAYS MY SKIFF THE GUTTER THE HAIRDRESSER WHO SAYS MY MEALY BACK THE COBBLER WHO SAYS MY CUB TALKS SLANG
4507-16021-0022 THERE IS THE SLANG OF THE AFFECTED LADY AS WELL AS OF THE PRECIATES
4507-16021-0023 THE SUGAR MANUFACTURER WHO SAYS LOAF CLARIFIED LUMPS BASTARD COMMON BURNT IT THIS HONEST MANUFACTURER TALKS SLANG
4507-16021-0024 ALGEBRA OR MEDICINE BOTANY HAVE EACH THEIR SLANG
4507-16021-0025 TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS CONFLICT WRETCHEDNESS HAS INVENTED A LANGUAGE OF COMBAT WHICH HAS SLANG
4507-16021-0026 TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MAN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF WHICH CIVILIZATION IS COMPOSED OR BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO EXTEND THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION IT IS TO SERVE CIVILIZATION ITSELF
4507-16021-0027 AND PHOENICIAN VERY GOOD
4507-16021-0028 EVEN DIALECT LET THAT PASS IT
4507-16021-0029 TO THIS WE APPLY IN ONE WORD ONLY
4507-16021-0030 ASSUREDLY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION OR STUDY
4507-16021-0031 AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT A STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH A VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICE IS PERMITTED
4507-16021-0032 HE MUST DESCEND WITH HIS HEART FULL OF CHARITY AND SEVERITY AT THE SAME TIME AS A BROTHER AND AS A JUDGE TO THOSE IMPENETRABLE CASEMATES WHERE CRAWL PELL MELL THOSE WHO BLEED AND THOSE WHO DEAL THE BLOW THOSE WHO WEEP AND THOSE WHO CURSE THOSE WHO PASS AND THOSE WHO DEVOUR THOSE WHO ENDURE EVIL AND THOSE WHO INFLICT IT
4507-16021-0033 DO WE REALLY KNOW THE ISLAND WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CAVERN
4507-16021-0034 THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPONDS TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS INTERLACED AND WHICH OFTEN BRING FORTH RESULTS
4507-16021-0035 TRULY HISTORY BEING A MIXTURE OF ALL THINGS THE TRUE HISTORIAN MINGLES IN EVERY THING
4507-16021-0036 FACTS FORM FROM ONE OF THESE AND IDEAS THE OTHER
4507-16021-0037 THERE IT CLOTHES ITSELF IN WORD MASKS OF METAPHOR RAGS
4507-16021-0038 IN THIS GUISE IT BECOMES NATURAL
4507-16021-0039 ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT A HIDEOUS MURMUR SOUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN AN ARTICULATE WORD
4507-16021-0040 ONE THINKS ONE HEARS HYDRAS TALKING TO
4507-16021-0041 IT IS UNINTELLIGIBLE WITH THE DARK
4507-16021-0042 IT IS BLACK IN MISFORTUNE IT IS BLACKER STILL IN CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED TO COMPOSE SLANG
4507-16021-0043 THE HEART IS NOT DEVOID OF RESEMBLANCE TO A JAIL
4507-16021-0044 LOOK CLOSELY AT ONE
4507-16021-0045 IT IS SO MADE THAT EVERYWHERE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENTS
4507-16021-0046 EACH DAY HAS ITS OWN GREAT GRIEF FOR ITS LITTLE SAKE
4507-16021-0047 YESTERDAY YOU WERE TREMBLING FOR A HEALTH THAT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR OWN TO MORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE DIATRIBE OF A SLANDERER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THEN THE QUARRELING WEATHER THEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN OR LOST THEN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE AND YOUR VERTEBRAL COLUMN REPROACHING YOU AGAIN THE COURSE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
4507-16021-0048 THIS WITHOUT RECKONING AT THE PAINS OF THE HEART AND SO IT GOES ON
4507-16021-0049 THERE IS HARDLY ONE WAY OUT OF A HUNDRED WHICH IS WHOLLY JOYOUS AND SUNNY
4507-16021-0050 AND YOU BELONG TO THAT SMALL CLASSES WHO ARE HAPPY
4507-16021-0051 IN THIS WORLD'S EVIDENTLY THE VESTIBULE OF ANOTHER THERE ARE NO LONGER
4507-16021-0052 THE REALLY HUMAN DIVISION IS THIS THE LUMINOUS AND THE SHADY
4507-16021-0053 TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF A SHADY TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF THE LUMINOUS THAT IS THE OBJECT
4507-16021-0054 THAT IS WHY WE CRY CRIED EDUCATION SCIENCE
4507-16021-0055 TO TEACH READING MEANS TO LIGHT THE FIRE EVERY SYLLABLE SPELT OUT SPARKIES
4507-16021-0056 HOWEVER HE WHO SAYS LIGHT DOES NOT NECESSARILY SAY JOYS
4507-16021-0057 THAT PEOPLE SUFFER IN THE LIGHT EXCESS BURNS
4507-16021-0058 THE FLAME IS THE MEMORY OF THE WING
4507-16021-0059 TO BURN IT WITHOUT CEASING TO FLY THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF GENIUS
4970-29093-0000 YOU'LL NEVER DIG IT OUT AT THE ASTOR LIBRARY
4970-29093-0001 TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN HERE OR ELSEWHERE THE PATHS TO FORTUNE ARE INNUMERABLE AND ALL OPEN THERE WAS INVITATION IN THE AIR AND SUCCESS IN ALL HIS WIDE HORIZON
4970-29093-0002 HE HAS NO TRADITIONS TO BIND HIM OR GUIDE HIM AND HIS IMPULSE IS TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE OCCUPATION HIS FATHER HAS FOLLOWED AND MAKE NEW WAY FOR HIMSELF
4970-29093-0003 THE MODEST FELLOW WOULD HAVE LIKED FAME THRUST UPON HIM FOR SOME WORTHY ACHIEVEMENT IT MIGHT BE FOR A BOOK OR FOR THE SKILLFUL MANAGEMENT OF SOME GREAT NEWSPAPER OR FOR SOME DARING EXPEDITION LIKE THAT OF LIEUTENANT STROYNE OR DOCTOR KANE
4970-29093-0004 HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE DIRECTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE
4970-29093-0005 SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A CONSPICUOUS PULPIT AND HUMBLY PREACH THE GOSPEL OF REPENTANCE AND IT EVEN CROSSED HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISSIONARY LIFE TO SOME BENIGHTED REGION WHERE THE DATE PALM GROWS AND THE NIGHTINGALE'S VOICE IS IN TUNE AND THE BULBUL SINGS ON THE OFTNITES
4970-29093-0006 LAW SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SCIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENTS WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK IN THE ANTEROOM OF THE LAW OFFICE WHERE HE WAS WRITING PHILIP INVARIABLY ADVISED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE GREATLY TO THE DISGUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTICE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN COULD ONLY BE ATTAINED BY THE RECOGNISED PROCESSES WITH THE TENANT FEES
4970-29093-0007 BUT IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
4970-29093-0008 HE WANTED TO BEGIN AT THE TOP OF THE BATTER
4970-29093-0009 PHILIP THEREFORE READ DILIGENTLY IN THE ASTOR LIBRARY PLANNED LITERARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPEL ATTENTION AND NURSED THEIR GENIUS
4970-29093-0010 HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO STEP INTO THE DORKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY GRAPEVINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GIVE A LINE FOR IT
4970-29093-0011 OH VERY WELL SAID GRINGO TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD A SENTENCE LIKE THAT
4970-29093-0012 BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THANKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL OR OUGHT TO FAIL
4970-29093-0013 AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS BOOKS AND TO HIS WAITING FOR AN OPENING LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIS DIGNIFIED ENTRANCE INTO THE LIBRARY WORLD
4970-29093-0014 WELL I'M GOING AS AN ENGINEER WE COULD GO AS ONE
4970-29093-0015 YOU CAN BEGIN BY CARRYING A ROD AND LOOKING DOWN THE FIGURES
4970-29093-0016 NO IT'S MUCH TOO SOON
4970-29093-0017 I'VE BEEN READY TO GO AWAY FOR SIX MONTHS
4970-29093-0018 THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BY THE TIME FULL OF THE ADVENTURE WENT DOWN TO THE WALL STREET OFFICE OF HENRY'S UNCLE AND HAD A TALK WITH THAT WILY OPERATOR
4970-29093-0019 THE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN PACKING UP AND WRITING LETTERS FOR PHILIP WOULD NEVER TAKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT INFORMING HIS FRIENDS
4970-29093-0020 WHY IT'S IN MISSOURI SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER I THINK WE'LL MAKE A MAP
4970-29093-0021 I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEARER ON
4970-29093-0022 HE KNEW HIS UNCLE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE HAD AT LAST CHANGED HIS THOUGHTS TO A PRACTICAL MATTER
4970-29093-0023 HE WELL KNEW THE PERILS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATES OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF FEVER
4970-29095-0000 SHE WAS TIRED OF OTHER TIMES
4970-29095-0001 SHE TRIED THIS MORNING AN AIR OR TWO UPON THE PIANO SANG HER SIMPLE SONG IN A SWEET BUT SLIGHTLY METALLIC VOICE AND THEN SEATING HERSELF BY THE OPEN WINDOW READ PHILIP'S LETTER
4970-29095-0002 WELL MOTHER SAID THE OLD STUDENT LOOKING UP WITH A SHADE OF IMPATIENCE
4970-29095-0003 I WANT THEE TOLD THE ELDERS THAT FATHER AND I ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIANO AND THAT MUCH AS THEE LOVES MUSIC THEE IS NEVER IN THE ROOM WHEN IT IS PLAYED
4970-29095-0004 I HEARD MY FATHER TELL COUSIN ABNER THAT HE WAS WHIPPED SO OFTEN FOR WHISTLING WHEN HE WAS A BOY THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE WHAT COMPENSATION HE COULD GET NOW
4970-29095-0005 THY WAYS GREATLY TRY ME SOOTH AND ALL THY RELATIONS
4970-29095-0006 IS THY FATHER WILLING THEE SHOULD GET AWAY TO A SCHOOL OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE
4970-29095-0007 I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY THAT SHE IS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS
4970-29095-0008 COME MOTHER I AM GOING TO STUDY MEDICINE
4970-29095-0009 MARGARET BOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUALLY PLACIDITY
4970-29095-0010 IF THEE STUDY MEDICINE
4970-29095-0011 DOES THEE THINK THEE COULD STAND AT SIX MONTHS
4970-29095-0012 AND AND BESIDES SUPPOSE THEE DOES LEARN MEDICINE
4970-29095-0013 I WILL CATCH IT
4970-29095-0014 WHERE THEE AND THY FAMILY IS KNOWN
4970-29095-0015 IF I CAN GET AT PATIENCE
4970-29095-0016 RUTH SAT QUITE STILL FOR A MOMENT WITH FACE INTENT AND FLUSHED IT WAS OUT NOW
4970-29095-0017 THE SIGHTSEERS RETIRED IN HIGH SPIRITS FROM THE CITY
4970-29095-0018 RUTH ASKED THE ENTHUSIASTS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN SUCH A SOUNDED MAUSOLEUM WITH ITS GREAT HALLS AND ECHOING ROOMS AND NO COMFORTABLE PLACE IN IT FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF ANY BODY
4970-29095-0019 AND THEN THERE WAS BROADLY STREET
4970-29095-0020 THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO END TO IT AND EVEN RUTH WAS PHILADELPHIAN ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT A STORY OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARCHITECTURAL POINT UPON WHICH THE WEARY EYE COULD REST
4970-29095-0021 BUT NEITHER SAINT GERARD NOR BROAD STREET NEITHER WONDERS OF THE MINT NOR THE GLORIES OF THE HALL WHERE THE GHOSTS OF OUR FATHERS SIT ALWAYS SIGNING A DECLARATION IMPRESSED THE VISITORS SO MUCH AS THE SPLENDORS OF THE CHESTNUT STREET WINDOWS AND THE BARGAINS ON EIGHTH STREET
4970-29095-0022 IS THEE GOING TO THE YEARLY MEETING RUTH ASKED ONE OF THE OTHERS
4970-29095-0023 I HAVE NOTHING TO HEAR REPLIED THAT DEMURE PERSON
4970-29095-0024 IT HAS OCCUPIED MOTHER A LONG TIME TO FIND AT THE SHOPS THE EXACT CHANGE FOR HER NEW BONNET
4970-29095-0025 AND THEE WON'T GO WHY SHOULD HE
4970-29095-0026 IF I GO TO MEETING AT ALL I LIKE BEST TO SIT IN MY QUIET OLD HOUSE IN GERMANTOWN WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE ALL OPEN AND I CAN SEE THE TREES AND HEAR THE STIR OF THE LEAVES
4970-29095-0027 IT'S SUCH A CRUSH AT THE YEARLY MEETINGS AT ARCH STREET AND THEN THERE'S THE ROW OF SLEEK LOOKING YOUNG MEN WHO LINE THE CURBSTONE AND STARE AT US AS WE COME OUT
4970-29095-0028 HE DOESN'T SAY BUT IT'S ON THE FRONTIER AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESSERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLATE AS A WEDNESDAY MEETING HUGH IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING
4970-29095-0029 IS HE GOING TO START A DAILY NEWSPAPER UP AMONG THE KICKAPOOS
4970-29095-0030 FATHER THEE'S UNJUST TO FILL UP HE'S GOING IN BUSINESS
4970-29095-0031 HE DOESN'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SAID RUTH A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT LAND AND RAILROADS AND THEE KNOWS FATHER THAT FORTUNES ARE MADE NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW AND A NEW COUNTRY
4970-29095-0032 BUT PHILIP IS HONEST AND HE HAS TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRAMBLING TO MAKE HIS WAY
4970-29095-0033 WHAT A BOX WOMEN ARE PUT INTO OR MEASURED FOR IT AND PUT IN YOUNG IF WE GO ANYWHERE IT'S IN A BOX VEILED AND PINIONED AND SHUT IN BY DISABILITIES
4970-29095-0034 WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN INACTION BECAUSE I WAS A GIRL
4970-29095-0035 AND IF I HAD THAT FORTUNE WOULD THEE WANT ME TO LEAD A USELESS LIFE
4970-29095-0036 HAS THEE CONSULTED THY MOTHER ABOUT A CAREER I SUPPOSE IT IS A CAREER OF THEE MUCH
4970-29095-0037 BUT THAT WISE AND PLACID WOMAN UNDERSTOOD THAT SWEET REBEL A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN RUTH UNDERSTOOD HERSELF
4970-29095-0038 RUTH WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT PHILIP HAD MADE A PUSH INTO THIS WORLD AND SHE WAS SURE THAT HIS TALENT AND COURAGE WOULD MAKE A WAY FOR HIM
4992-23283-0000 BUT THE MORE FORGETFULNESS HAD THEN PREVAILED THE MORE POWERFUL WAS THIS FORCE OF REMEMBRANCE WHEN SHE AWOKE
4992-23283-0001 MISS MISNER'S HEALTH IS NOT GOOD
4992-23283-0002 SAID MISSUS HORSTON A FEW MINUTES AFTER
4992-23283-0003 SO HERE IS TO ME ADDED SAMFORD WITH A SARCASTIC SNEER
4992-23283-0004 AND YET YOU MUST OWN HER BEHAVIOUR HAS WARRANTED THEM HAS IT NOT BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR INCOHERENT AND UNACCOUNTABLE AND
4992-23283-0005 NOT THAT I KNOW OF NOT ONE MORE THAT I KNOW OF I REPLIED WITH ASTONISHMENT AT WHAT SHE HAD INSINUATED AND YET WITH A PERFECT ASSURANCE THAT SHE WAS IN THE WRONG
4992-23283-0006 OH PERHAPS I AM MISTAKEN ANSWERED SHE
4992-23283-0007 TO ASK ANY MORE QUESTIONS OF YOU I BELIEVE WOULD BE VERY UNFAIR
4992-23283-0008 SHE SEEMED TO WAIT FOR HER REPLY BUT AS SHE MADE NONE HE PROCEEDED
4992-23283-0009 OH MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODSLEY WITH A MOST FORCIBLE ACCENT YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH SHE WOULD PARDON ME FOR INTRUSTING
4992-23283-0010 BUT IN SUCH A CASE MISS MILNER'S ELECTION OF A HUSBAND SHALL NOT REACH MINE
4992-23283-0011 IF HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO ESTIMATE HER OWN VALUE I DO
4992-23283-0012 INDEPENDENT OF HER FORTUNE SHE HAS BEAUTY TO CAPTIVATE THE HEARTS OF ANY MAN AND WITH ALL HER FOLLIES SHE HAS A FRANKNESS IN HER MANNER AN UNAFFECTED WISDOM IN HER THOUGHTS A VIVACITY IN HER CONVERSATION AND WITHAL A SOFTNESS IN HER DEMEANOUR THAT MIGHT ALONE ENGAGE THE AFFECTIONS OF A MAN OF THE NICEST SENTIMENTS AND THE STRONGEST UNDERSTANDING
4992-23283-0013 MY LORD MISS MILNER'S FACE IS NOT A DEPRAVED ONE IT IS BUT TOO REFINED
4992-23283-0014 WHAT CAN YOU MEAN BY THAT OF MISS WOODLEY YOU TALK MYSTERIOUSLY
4992-23283-0015 IS SHE NOT AWARE THAT I WILL THWART HER INCLINATIONS
4992-23283-0016 AGAIN HE SEARCHED HIS OWN THOUGHTS WHILE INEFFECTUALLY AS BEFORE
4992-23283-0017 MISS WOODLEY WAS TOO LITTLE VERSED IN THE SUBJECT TO KNOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT TO LOVE AT ALL AT LEAST NOT TO THE EXTENT OF BREAKING THROUGH ENGAGEMENTS AND ALL THE VARIOUS OBSTACLES THAT STILL MITIGATED AGAINST OUR UNION
4992-23283-0018 TO RELIEVE HER FROM BOTH HE LAID HIS HAND WITH FORCE UPON HIS HEART AND SAID DO YOU HEAR ME
4992-23283-0019 I WILL MAKE NO USELESS USE OF WHAT I KNOW HE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS I BELIEVE YOU MY LORD
4992-23283-0020 I HAVE NEVER YET HOWEVER BEEN VANQUISHED BY THEM AND EVEN UPON THIS OCCASION MY REASON SHALL COMBAT THEM AT THE LAST AND MY REASON SHALL FAIL ME BEFORE I DO WRONG
4992-41797-0000 YA'S DEAD THESE FOUR YEARS AND A GOOD JOB FOR HER TOO
4992-41797-0001 WELL AS I SAY IT'S AN AWFUL QUEER WORLD THEY CLAP ALL THE BURGLARS IN JAIL AND THE MURDERERS AND THE WIFE BEATERS I ALLERS THOUGHT A GENTLE REPROOF WOULD BE ENOUGH PUNISHMENT FOR A WIFE BEATER COS HE PROB'LY HAS A LOT OF PROVOCATIONS THAT NOBODY KNOWS AND THE FIRE BUGS CAN'T THINK O THE RIGHT NAME SOMETHIN LIKE SENDIARIES AND THE BREAKERS OF THE PEACE AND WHAT NOT AND YET THE LAW HAS NOTHING TO SAY TO A MAN LIKE HEN LORD
4992-41797-0002 HIS GRANDFATHER WAS ALEXANDER CAREY L L D DOCTOR OF LAWS THAT IS
4992-41797-0003 MISTER POPHAM LAID DOWN HIS BRUSHE
4992-41797-0004 A I SWAIN TO MAN HE EJACULATED IF YOU DON'T WORK HARD YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES DOCTOR OF LAWS

4992-41797-0008 MISTER POPHAM EXAGGERATED NOTHING BUT ON THE CONTRARY LEFT MUCH UNSAID IN HIS NARRATIVE OF THE FAMILY AS THE HOUSE OF LORDS
4992-41797-0009 HENRY LORD WITH THE DEGREE OF P H B TO HIS CREDIT HAD BEEN PROFESSOR OF ZOOLOGY AT A NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE BUT HAD RESIGNED HIS POST IN ORDER TO WRITE A SERIES OF SCIENTIFIC TEXT BOOKS
4992-41797-0010 ALWAYS IRRITABLE COLD INDIFFERENT HE HAD GROWN GREATLY MORE SO AS YEARS WENT ON
4992-41797-0011 AND WHATEVER APPEALED TO HER SENSE OF BEAUTY WAS STRAIGHTWAY TRANSFERRED TO PAPER OR CANVAS
4992-41797-0012 SHE HAS WILD TO KNOW HOW TO DO THINGS
4992-41797-0013 SHE MAKES EFFORT AFTER EFFORT TREMBLING WITH EAGERNESS AND WHEN SHE FAILS TO REPRODUCE WHAT SHE SEES SHE WORKS HERSELF UP INTO A FRENZY OF GRIEF AND DISAPPOINTMENT
4992-41797-0014 AS SHE COULD NOT MAKE A RABBIT OR A BIRD LOOK REAL ON PAPER SHE SEARCHED IN HER FATHER'S BOOKS FOR PICTURES OF ITS BONES
4992-41797-0015 CYRIL THERE MUST BE SOME BETTER WAY OF DOING I JUST DRAW THE OUTLINE OF AN ENEMY AND THEN I PUT HAIRS OR FEATHERS ON IT THEY HAVE NO BODIES

4992-41806-0001 TONIGHT THERE WAS NO NEED OF EXTRA HEAT AND THERE WERE GREAT CEREMONIES TO BE OBSERVED IN LIGHTING THE FIRES ON THE HEARTH STUBS

5105-28233-0002 IT MUST BE OWNED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS HIM THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITERARY ATTAINMENTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDER
5105-28233-0003 WE DON'T SPIN TOPS IT IS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVADAC BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS
5105-28233-0004 ONCE IN ACTION SHE WAS LEADING A DETACHMENT OF INFANTRY THROUGH AN INTRENCHMENT
5105-28233-0005 SOMETIMES HE WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHORE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY A RIDE ALONG THE SUMMIT OF THAT CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
5105-28233-0006 NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BURGOS ITSELF COULD VIE WITH A CHURCH AT MONTMATRA
5105-28233-0007 BEN ZOOF'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVADAC'S EARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THE EIGHTEENTH ARRONDISSEMENT OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMARTRE WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
5105-28233-0008 WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED AN ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVADAC
5105-28233-0009 THE BOND OF UNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BEN ZOOF'S ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM A RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONOURS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
5105-28233-0010 UNLIKE HIS MASTER HE HAD MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANECDOTES AND TROOPERS TALES HE WAS MATCHLESS
5105-28240-0000 AND FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM SERVADAC HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
5105-28240-0001 IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE FROM THE EARTH'S CONVEXITY AND THE CONSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THE RANGE OF VISION THE RIGGING OF THE TOPMASTS ALONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER
5105-28240-0002 EXCLAIMED SERVADAC PUTTING HIS EYE UNMOVED AT HIS TELESCOPE
5105-28240-0003 SHE IS UNDER SAIL BUT SHE IS COUNT TIMASCHEFF'S YACHT IT WAS RIGHT
5105-28240-0004 IF THE COUNT WERE ON BOARD A LARGE FATALITY WAS BRINGING HIM TO THE PRESENCE OF HIS RIVAL
5105-28240-0005 HE RECKONED THEREFORE NOT ONLY UPON ASCERTAINING THE EXTENT OF THE DEAD CATASTROPHE BUT UPON LEARNING ITS CAUSE
5105-28240-0006 THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOBRYNA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED COLD AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
5105-28240-0007 SERVADAC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE DOBRYNA WAS ENDEAVOURING TO PUT IT IN
5105-28240-0008 A NARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THAT RIDGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE ROUGHEST WEATHER WOULD INSURE THE CALMNESS OF ITS WATERS
5105-28240-0009 SLIGHTLY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK HER MAINSAIL AND IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HELMSMAN SOON CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOPSAILS THE BRIGANTINE AND JIB
5105-28240-0010 CAPTAIN SERVADAC HASTENED BESIDE HIM
5105-28240-0011 I LEFT YOU ON A CONTINENT AND HERE I HAVE THE HONOUR OF FINDING YOU AN ISLAND
5105-28240-0012 NEVER MIND NOW INTERPOSED THE CAPTAIN WE SHALL TALK OF THAT BY AND BYE
5105-28240-0013 NEVER MORE THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
5105-28240-0014 AND ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEDITERRANEAN
5105-28240-0015 FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SEEMED PERFECTLY STUPEFIED AND THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF HE BEGAN TO OVERWHELM THE COUCH WITH A TORRENT OF QUESTIONS
5105-28240-0016 TO ALL HIS INQUIRIES THE COUNT RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
5105-28240-0017 SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A CONVULSION OF THESE ELEMENTS
5105-28240-0018 YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD TO COUNT WILL YOU NOT
5105-28240-0019 MY YACHT IS AT YOUR SERVICE MISTER EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRE TO MAKE A TOUR ROUND THE WORLD
5105-28240-0020 THE COUNT SHOOK HIS HAT
5105-28240-0021 BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE ENGINE OF THE DOBRYNA SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVAS ONLY WOULD IN CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS BE BOTH TEDIOUS OR DIFFICULT
5105-28240-0022 IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY AND THE REPAIRS OF THE SCHOONER WERE COMPLETED
5105-28240-0023 A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO SOME ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
5105-28240-0024 DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BEN ZOOM TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
5105-28241-0000 HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED IN A CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE GLOBE
5105-28241-0001 AFTER AN APPRENTICESHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHEN THE COUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YACHT IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FAR THE GREAT PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHILST IN THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS
5105-28241-0002 THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOPE MANIFESTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE CAMP SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
5105-28241-0003 STEAM UP AND CANVAS SPREAD THE SCHOONER DARTING EASTWARDS
5105-28241-0004 ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THE AIR WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMINUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARTICLES SO BUOYANT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF OSCILLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THAT WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED
5105-28241-0005 FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALGERIA BUT NOW LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
5105-28241-0006 THE LOG AND THE COMPASSES THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SEXTANT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS
5105-28241-0007 THERE'S NO FEAR OF THAT SISTER
5105-28241-0008 THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON THE NEW ORBIT BUT SHE IS NOT INCURRING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED ON TO THE SUN
5105-28241-0009 AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED SERVADAC EAGERLY THAT IT CAN NOT HAPPEN
5105-28241-0010 THAT OCEAN REIGNED SUPREME
5105-28241-0011 ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UP HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE DEPTHS OF OCEAN WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE ALGERIAN METROPOLIS
5105-28241-0012 IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT ANY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO QUICKLY
5105-28241-0013 HAD NOT THE LOFTIEST EMINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
5105-28241-0014 ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE BUT MOST REMARKABLE
5105-28241-0015 TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM DEPTH OF FROM FOUR TO FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SITE OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRACED LIKE THE GATES OF AN AMPHITHEATRE
5105-28241-0016 YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALGERIA AS YOU IMAGINED
5105-28241-0017 AFTER PONDERING A WHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF TWELVE FATHOMS FIVE FATHOMS
5105-28241-0018 ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARREN OF MARINE PRODUCTION IN ANY TYPE
5105-28241-0019 NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN IN DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARDS THE NORTHERN
5142-33396-0000 AT ANOTHER TIME HAROLD ASKS
5142-33396-0001 WHAT IS THIS COUNTRY OLAF HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN A THRALL THE THRALL'S EYES FLASHED
5142-33396-0002 TWO HUNDRED WARRIORS FEASTED IN HIS WALLS AND FOLLOWED HIM TO BATTLE
5142-33396-0003 THE REST OF YOU OFF A VIKING HE HAD THREE FACES
5142-33396-0004 THESE HE GAVE TO MANY OF MY BROTHERS
5142-33396-0005 BUT I STAYED THAT SPRING AND BUILT ME A HOUSE
5142-33396-0006 I MADE HER FOR ONLY TWELVE OARS BECAUSE I THOUGHT FEW MEN WOULD FOLLOW ME FOR I WAS YOUNG FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
5142-33396-0007 AT THE PROW I CARVED THE HAND WITH OPEN MOUTH AND FORKED TONGUE THRUST OUT
5142-33396-0008 I POINTED THE EYES RED FOR ANGER
5142-33396-0009 THERE STOP SO I SAID AND GLARE AND HISS AT MY FOES
5142-33396-0010 IN THE STERN I CARVED THE TAIL UP ALMOST AS HIGH AS THE FOOT
5142-33396-0011 THERE SHE SAT UP ON THE ROLLERS AS FAIR A SHIP AS I EVER SAW
5142-33396-0012 THEN I WILL GET ME A FARMER AND WILL WIN HER IN THAT LAND NOW WHO WILL FOLLOW ME
5142-33396-0013 HE HAS BUT A BOY THE MAN SAID
5142-33396-0014 THIRTY MEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER RAISED THEIR HORNS IN SAID
5142-33396-0015 AS OUR BOAT FLASHED DOWN THE ROLLS INTO THE WATER I MADE THIS SONG AND SANG IT
5142-33396-0016 NOT SO WE HARRIED THE COAST OF NORWAY
5142-33396-0017 WE ATE AT MANY MEN'S TABLES UNINVIDED
5142-33396-0018 MY DRAGON'S BELLY IS NEVER FULL AND ON A BOARD WENT THE GOLD
5142-33396-0019 OH IT IS BETTER TO LIVE ON THAT SEA AND LET OTHER MEN RAISE YOUR CROPS AND COOK YOUR MEALS
5142-33396-0020 A HOUSE SMELLS OF SMOKE A CHURCH SMELLS OF FROLIC
5142-33396-0021 UP AN DOWN THE WATER WE WENT TO GET MUCH WEALTH AND MUCH FROLIC
5142-33396-0022 WHAT OF THE FARM OLOFT NOT YET I ANSWERED VIKING IS BETTER FOR SUMMER
5142-33396-0023 IT WAS SO DARK THAT I SHOULD SEE NOTHING BUT A FEW SPARKS ON THE HEARTH
5142-33396-0024 I STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL FOR I WANTED NO SWORD REACHING OUT THE DARK FOR ME
5142-33396-0025 COME COME I CALLED WHEN NO ONE OBEYED A CRY
5142-33396-0026 MY MOTHER LAUGHED YES A STINGY HOST
5142-33396-0027 HE ACTS AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT AFFECTED US
5142-33396-0028 ON A BENCH IN A FAIR CORNER WERE A DOZEN PEOPLE HUDDLED TOGETHER
5142-33396-0029 BRINGS IN THE TABLE WE ARE HUNGRY
5142-33396-0030 THE THRALLS WERE BRINGING IN A GREAT AMOUNT OF MEAT
5142-33396-0031 THEY SET UP A CRANE ON THE FIRE AND HUNG THE POT UPON IT AND WE SAT AND WATCHED IT BOIL WHILE WE JOKED AT LAST THE SUPPER BEGAN
5142-33396-0032 THE FARMER SAT GLOOMILY ON THE BENCH AND WOULD NOT EAT AND YOU NOT WONDER FOR HE SAW US PUTTING POTFULS OF HIS GOOD BEEF AND BASKET LOADS OF BREAD INTO OUR BIG MOUTHS
5142-33396-0033 YOU WOULD NOT EAT WITH US YOU CANNOT SAY NO AT HALF OF MY ALE I DRINK THIS TO YOUR HEALTH
5142-33396-0034 THEN I DRANK HALF OF THIS HORNFUL AND SET THE REST ACROSS THE FIRE TO THE FARMER HE TOOK IT AND SMILED SAYING
5142-33396-0035 DID YOU EVER HAVE SUCH A LORDLY CHEST BEFORE I WENT ON
5142-33396-0036 SO I WILL GIVE OUT THIS LAW THAT MY MEN SHALL NEVER LEAVE ME ALONE
5142-33396-0037 HOCKING THERE SHOULD BE YOUR CONSTANT COMPANION FRIEND FARMER
5142-33396-0038 HE SHALL NOT LEAVE YOU DAY OR NIGHT WHETHER WE ARE WORKING OR PLAYING OR SLEEPING
5142-33396-0039 I NAMED NINE HOURS AND SAID
5142-33396-0040 AND HE SHALL FOLLOW YOUR THRALLS IN THE SAME WAY
5142-33396-0041 BUT I SET GUARDS OVER EVERY ONE IN THAT HOUSE
5142-33396-0042 SO NO TALES GOT OUT TO THE NEIGHBORS BESIDES IT WAS A LONELY PLACE AND BY GOOD LUCK NO ONE CAME THE WAY
5142-33396-0043 THEIR EYES DANCED BIG TORE LEAF STOOD UP AND STRETCHED HERSELF
5142-33396-0044 I'M STIFF WITH LONG SITTING HE SAID I ITCH FOR A FIGHT I TURNED TO THE FARM
5142-33396-0045 THIS IS OUR LAST FEAST WITHOUT YOU I SAID
5142-33396-0046 BY THE BEARD OF ODIN SHE CRIED YOU HAVE TAKEN OUR JOKE LIKE A MAN
5142-33396-0047 MY MEN POUNDED THE TABLE WITH HIS FISTS
5142-33396-0048 BY THE HAMMER OF THOR SHOUTED GRIM THERE IS NO DINGY COWARD
5142-33396-0049 HERE FRIEND TAKE IT AS HE THRUST IT INTO THE FARMER'S HAND
5142-33396-0050 MAY YOU DRINK HEART'S EASE THROUGH IT FOR MANY YEARS
5142-33396-0051 AND WITH IT I LEAVE YOU A NAME SYP THE FRIENDLY I SHALL HOPE TO DRINK WITH YOU SOME TIME IN VALHALLA
5142-33396-0052 HERE IS A RING FOR SIFT AND FRIENDLY AND HERE IS A BRACELET AND A SWORD WOULD NOT BE ASHAMED TO HANG AT YOUR SIDE
5142-33396-0053 I TOOK SIX GREAT BRACELETS OF GOLD FROM OUR TREASURE CHEST AND GAVE THEM TO HIM
5142-33396-0054 THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DECIDE FOR THE SPEAR WILL ALWAYS POINT SOMEHOW AND ONE THING IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER
5142-33396-0055 THAT TIME YOU POINTED US INTO YOUR FATHER'S SHIPS
5142-33396-0056 HERE THEY SAID IS A RASCAL WHO HAS BEEN HARRYING OUR COURTS
5142-33396-0057 WE SUNK HIS SHIP AND MEN BUT HIM WE BOUGHT TO YOU
5142-33396-0058 A ROBBER VIKING SAID THE KING AND HE SCOWLED AT THEM
5142-33396-0059 YES AND WITH ALL YOUR FINGERS IT TOOK YOU A YEAR TO PATCH ME THE KING FROWNED MORE ANGRILY
5142-33396-0060 TAKE HIM OUT TORQUILL AND LET HIM TASTE YOUR SWORD
5142-33396-0061 YOUR MAMMA THE QUEEN WAS STANDING BY
5142-33396-0062 OH SHE PUT HER HAND ON HIS ARM AND SMILED AND SAID
5142-33396-0063 OR WOULD HE NOT BE A GOOD GIFT FOR OUR BABY
5142-33396-0064 HER FATHER THOUGHT A MOMENT THEN LOOKED AT YOUR MOTHER AND SMILED
5142-33396-0065 SOFT HEART HE SAID GENTLY TO HER THEN TO TORKELL WELL LET US GO TORKELL
5142-33396-0066 THEN HE WENT TO ME AGAIN FROWNING
5142-33396-0067 BUT YOUNG SHARP TONGUE NOW THAT WE HAVE CAUGHT YOU WE WILL PUT YOU INTO A TRAP THAT WE CANNOT GET OUT OF
5142-33396-0068 SO I LIVED AND NOW I'M YOUR TOOTH THRALL THEN IT IS THE LUCK OF WAR
5142-36377-0000 IT WAS ONE OF THE MASTERLY AND CHARMING STORIES OF DU MOR THE ELDER
5142-36377-0001 IN FIVE MINUTES I WAS IN A NEW WORLD AND MY MELANCHOLY LITTLE ROOM WAS FULL OF THE LIVELIEST FRENCH COMPANY
5142-36377-0002 THE SOUND OF AN IMPERATIVE AND UNCOMPROMISING BELL RECALLED ME IN DUE TIME TO THE REGIONS OF GRAVITY
5142-36377-0003 AMBROSE MET ME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND SHOWED ME THE WAY TO THE OTHER ROOM
5142-36377-0004 SHE SIGNING TO ME WITH A GHOSTLY SOLEMNITY TO TAKE THE VACANT PLACE ON THE LEFT OF HER FATHER
5142-36377-0005 THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN WHILE I WAS STILL STUDYING THE TWO BROTHERS WITHOUT I HONESTLY CONFESS BEING VERY FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY EACH OF THEM
5142-36377-0006 A NEW MEMBER OF THE ARMY CIRCLE WHO INSTANTLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION ENTERED THE ROOM
5142-36377-0007 A LITTLE CRACKED THAT IN THE POPULAR PHRASE IS MY IMPRESSION OF THE STRANGER WHO NOW MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE SUPPER ROOM
5142-36377-0008 MISTER MEADOWCROFT THE ELDER HAVING NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD THUS FOR HIMSELF INTRODUCED THE NEW COMER TO ME WITH A SIDE GLANCE AT HIS SONS WHICH HAD SOMETHING LIKE DEFIANCE IN IT A GLANCE WHICH AS I WAS SORRY TO NOTICE WAS RETURNED WITH A DEFIANCE ON THEIR SIDE BY THE TWO YOUNG MEN
5142-36377-0009 PHILIPP LA FRANK THIS IS MY OVERLOOKER MISTER JAGO SAID THE OLD MAN FORMALLY PRESENTING US
5142-36377-0010 HE IS NOT WELL HE HAS COME OVER THE OCEAN FOR REST OR CHANGE OF SCENE
5142-36377-0011 MISTER JAGO IS AN AMERICAN FELLOW
5142-36377-0012 MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER IAGO SIT BEFORE
5142-36377-0013 THEY POINTEDLY DREW BACK FROM JOHN STAGO AS HE APPROACHED THE EMPTY CHAIR NEXT TO ME AND MOVED ROUND TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE
5142-36377-0014 A PRETTY GIRL AND SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE BY APPEARANCES A GOOD GIRL TOO DESCRIBING HER JOURNEY I MAY SAY THAT SHE HAD A SMALL HEAD WELL CARRIED AND WELL SET ON HER SHOULDERS BRIGHT GREY EYES THAT LOOKED AT YOU HONESTLY AND MEANT WHAT THEY LOOKED A TRIM SLIGHT LITTLE FIGURE TOO SLIGHT FOR OUR ENGLISH NOTIONS OF BEAUTY A STRONG AMERICAN ACCENT AND A RARE THING IN AMERICA A PLEASANTLY TONED VOICE WHICH MADE THE ACCENT AGREEABLE TO ENGLISH EARS
5142-36377-0015 OUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF PEOPLE ARE IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN THAT RIGHT IMPRESSIONS
5142-36377-0016 FOR ONCE IN A WAY I PROVED A TRUE WIFE
5142-36377-0017 THE ONLY CHEERFUL CONVERSATION WAS IN THE CONVERSATION ACROSS THE TABLE BETWEEN NAOMI AND ME
5142-36377-0018 HE LOOKED UP AT NAOMI DOUBTINGLY FROM HIS PLATE HE LOOKED DOWN AGAIN SLOWLY WITH A FROWN
5142-36377-0019 WHEN I ADDRESSED HIM HE ANSWERED CONSTRAINDLY
5142-36377-0020 A MORE DREARY AND MORE DISUNITED FAMILY PARTY I HAVE NEVER SAT AT TABLE WITH
5142-36377-0021 ENVY HATRED MALICE AND UNCHARITABLENESS ARE NEVER SO ESSENTIALLY DETESTABLE TO MY MIND AS WHEN THEY ARE ANIMATED BY THE SENSE OF PROPRIETY AND WORK UNDER THE SURFACE BUT FOR MY INTEREST IN NAOMI AND MY OTHER INTERESTS IN THE LITTLE LOVE LOOKS WHICH I NOW AND THEN SURPRISED PASSING BETWEEN HER AND AMBROSE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SAT THROUGH THAT SUPPER
5142-36377-0022 I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT SHE LAID HER BONY HANDS ON THE BACK OF MISTER MEADOWCROFT'S INVALID CHAIR CUT HIM SHORT IN HIS FAREWELL SALUTATION TO ME AND WHEELED HIM DOWN TO HIS BED AS IF SHE WERE WHEELING HIM OUT TO HIS GRAVE
5142-36377-0023 YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT TO SAY NO AMBROSE BEGAN NEVER SMOKE WITH JAN IAGO HIS CIGARS WILL POISON YOU
5142-36377-0024 NAOMI SHOOK HER FOREFINGER REPROACHFULLY AT THEM AS IF HER TWO STURDY YOUNG FARMERS HAD BEEN TWO CHILDREN
5142-36377-0025 SILAS SLUNK AWAY WITHOUT A WORD OF PROTEST AMBROSE STOOD HIS GROUND EVIDENTLY BENT ON MAKING HIS PEACE WITH NAOMI BEFORE HE LEFT HER SEEING THAT I WAS IN THE WAY I WALK ASIDE TOWARD A GLASS DOOR AT THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM
5142-36586-0000 IT IS MANIFEST THAT MAN IS NOW SUBJECT TO ANY VARIABILITY
5142-36586-0001 SO IT IS WITH THESE LOWER ANIMALS
5142-36586-0002 THE VARIABILITY OF MULTIPLE PARTS AND
5142-36586-0003 BUT THIS SUBJECT WILL BE MORE SHARPLY DISCUSSED WHEN WE TREAT OF THE DIFFERENT RACES OF MANKIND
5142-36586-0004 FACTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUSE OF PARTS
5142-36600-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN FROM THE RACES OF MAN
5142-36600-0001 IN DETERMINING WHETHER TWO OR MORE ALLIED FORMS OUGHT TO BE RANKED AS SPECIES OR VARIETIES NATURALISTS ARE PRACTICALLY GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS NAMELY THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND WHETHER SUCH DIFFERENCES RELATE TO FEW OR MANY POINTS OF STRUCTURE AND WHETHER THEY ARE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE BUT MORE PARTICULARLY WHETHER THEY ARE CONSTANT
5639-40744-0000 ELEVEN O'CLOCK HAD STRUCK IT WAS A FINE CLEAR NIGHT THERE WERE THE ONLY PERSONS ON THE ROAD AND THEY SAUNTERED LEISURELY ALONG TO AVOID PAYING THE PRICE OF FATIGUE FOR THE RECREATION PROVIDED FOR THE TOLEDANS IN THE VALLEY OR UPON THE BANKS OF THEIR RIVER
5639-40744-0001 SECURE AS HE THOUGHT IN THE CAREFUL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THAT CITY AND THE CHARACTER OF ITS WELL DISPOSED INHABITANTS THE GOOD HIDALGO WAS FAR FROM THINKING THAT ANY DISASTER COULD BEFALL HIS FAMILIES
5639-40744-0002 RUDOLPHO AND HIS COMPANIONS WITH THEIR FACES MUFFLED IN THEIR CLOAKS STARED RUDELY AND INSOLENTLY AT THE MOTHER THE DAUGHTER OF THE SERVANT MAID
5639-40744-0003 IN A MOMENT HE COMMUNICATED HIS THOUGHTS TO HIS COMPANIONS AND THE NEXT MOMENT THEY RESOLVED TO TURN BACK AND CARRY HER OFF TO PLEASE RUDOLPHO FOR THE RICH WHO ARE OPEN HANDED ALWAYS FIND PARASITES READY TO ENCOURAGE THEIR BAD PROPENSITIES AND THUS TO CONCEIVE THIS WICKED DESIGN TO COMMUNICATE IT APPROVE IT RESOLVE ON RAVISHING LEOCADIA AND TO CARRY THE DESIGN INTO EFFECT WAS THE WORK OF A MOMENT
5639-40744-0004 THEY DREW THEIR SWORDS HID THEIR FACES ON THE FLAPS OF THEIR CLOAKS TURNED BACK AND SOON CAME IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE PARTY WHO HAD NOT YET DONE GIVING THANKS TO GOD FOR THEIR ESCAPE FROM THOSE AUDACIOUS MEN
5639-40744-0005 FINALLY THE ONE PARTY RAN OFF EXULTING AND THE OTHER WAS LEFT IN DESOLATION AND WOE
5639-40744-0006 UDOLPHO ARRIVED AT HIS OWN HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT AND LEOKADIA'S PARENTS REACHED THEIRS HEART BROKEN AND DESPAIRING
5639-40744-0007 MEANWHILE RUDOLPHO HAD LEOCADIA SAFE IN HIS CUSTODY AND IN HIS OWN APARTMENT
5639-40744-0008 WHO TOUCHES ME AM I IN DEBT
5639-40744-0009 MOTHER DEAR FATHER DO YOU BELIEVE ME
5639-40744-0010 IT IS THE ONLY AMENDS I ASK OF YOU FOR THE WRONG YOU HAVE DONE TO ME
5639-40744-0011 SHE FOUND THEIR DOOR BUT IT WAS LOCKED OUTSIDE
5639-40744-0012 SHE SUCCEEDED IN OPEN THE WINDOW AND THE MOONLIGHT SHONE IN SO BRIGHTLY THAT SHE COULD DISTINGUISH THE COLOUR OF SOME DAMASK HANGING IN THE ROOM
5639-40744-0013 SHE SAW THAT THE BREAD WAS GILDED AND SO RICH THAT IT SEEMED THAT OF A PRINCE RATHER THAN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN
5639-40744-0014 AMONG OTHER THINGS ON WHICH SHE CASTS HER EYES WAS A SMALL CRUCIFIX OF SOLID SILVER STANDING ON A CABINET NEAR THE WINDOW
5639-40744-0015 THIS PERSON WAS RODOLPHO WHO THOUGH HE HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR HIS FRIENDS HAD CHANGED HIS MIND IN THIS RESPECT NOT THINKING IT ADVISABLE TO ACQUAINT THEM WITH WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE GIRL
5639-40744-0016 ON THE CONTRARY HE RESOLVED TO TELL THEM THAT REPENTING OF HIS VIOLENCE AND MOVED BY A TEARS HE HAD ONLY CARRIED HER HALFWAY TOWARDS HIS HOUSE AND THEN LET HER GO
5639-40744-0017 CHOKING WITH EMOTION LENOCADIA MADE A SIGN TO HER PARENTS THAT SHE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH THEM
5639-40744-0018 THAT WOULD BE VERY WELL MY CHILD REPLIED HER FATHER IF YOUR PLAN WERE NOT LIABLE TO BE FRUSTRATED BY ORDINARY CUNNING BUT NO DOUBT THAT IMAGE HAD BEEN ALREADY MISSED BY ITS OWNER AND HE WILL HAVE SET IT DOWN FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE ROOM BY THE PERSON HE LOCKED UP THERE
5639-40744-0019 WHAT YOU HAD BEST DO MY CHILD IS TO GIVE IT AND PRAY TO IT THAT SINCE IT WAS A WITNESS TO YOUR UNDOING IT WILL DEIGN TO VINDICATE YOUR CAUSE BY ITS RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT
5639-40744-0020 THUS DID A HUMANE AND RIGHT MINDED FATHER COMFORT HIS UNHAPPY DAUGHTER AND HER MOTHER EMBRACING HER AGAIN DID ALL SHE COULD TO SOOTHE THE FEELINGS
5639-40744-0021 SHE MEANWHILE PASSED HER LIFE WITH HER PARENTS IN THE STRICTEST RETIREMENT NEVER LETTING HERSELF BE SEEN BUT SHUNNING EVERY EYE LEST IT SHOULD BRING HER MISFORTUNE IN HER FACE
5639-40744-0022 TIME ROLLED ON THE HOUR OF HER DELIVERY ARRIVED IT TOOK PLACE IN THE UTMOST SECRECY HER MOTHER TAKING UPON HER THE OFFICE OF MIDWIFE AND SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL NEVER SEEN
5639-40744-0023 WHEN THE BOY WENT THROUGH THE STREETS BLESSINGS WERE SHOWERED UPON HIM BY ALL WHO SAW HIM BLESSING UPON HIS BEAUTY UPON THE MOTHER THAT BORE HIM UPON THE FATHER THAT BEGOT HIM UPON THOSE WHO BROUGHT HIM UP SO WELL
5639-40744-0024 ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS SENT BY HIS GRANDFATHER WITH A MESSAGE TO A RELATION HE PASSED LONG A STREET IN WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT CONCOURSE OF HORSEMEN
5639-40744-0025 THE BEDS SHE TOO WELL REMEMBERED WAS THERE AND ABOVE ALL THE CABINET ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAGE SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS STILL ON THE SAME SPOT
5639-40744-0026 LEWIS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT IN A MONTH HE ROSE FROM HIS BED AND DURING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THE OWN CHILD
5639-40744-0027 THUS SAYING AND PRESSING THE CRUCIFIX TO HER BREAST SHE FELL FAINTING INTO THE ARMS OF DONA ESTAHANIA WHO WAS A GENTLEWOMAN TO WHOSE SEX PITY IS AS NATURAL AS CRUELTY AS TO A MAN INSTANTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO THOSE OF THE FAINTING GIRL SHEDDING OVER HER SO MANY TEARS THAT THERE NEEDED NO OTHER SPRINKLING OF WATER TO RECOVER LEO CADIA FROM HER SWOON
5639-40744-0028 I HAVE GREAT THINGS TO TELL YOU SENOR SAID DONA STEPHANIA TO HER HUSBAND THE CREAM AND SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS THIS THE FAINTING GIRL BEFORE YOU IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND THIS BOY IS YOUR GRANDSON
5639-40744-0029 THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAVE LEARNED FROM HER LIPS IS CONFIRMED BY HIS FACE IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH HELD THAT OF OUR SON
5639-40744-0030 JUST THEN LEOCADIA CAME TO HERSELF AND EMBRACING THE CROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO THE SEA OF TEARS AND THE GENTLEMAN REMAINING IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END LEOCADIA'S WHOLE STORY AND HE BELIEVED IT THROUGH THE BLESSED DISPENSATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONFIRMED IT BY SO MANY CONVINCING TESTIMONIES
5639-40744-0031 SO PERSUASIVE WERE HER ENTREATIES AND SO STRONG HER ASSURANCES THAT NO HARM WHATEVER COULD RESULT TO THEM FROM THE INFORMATION SHE SOUGHT THEY WERE INDUCED TO CONFESS THAT ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MENTIONED THEMSELVES AND ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON A STROLL WITH RODOLPHO THEY HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN THE ABDUCTION OF A GIRL WHOM UDOLPHO CARRIED OFF WHILE THE REST OF THEM DETAINED HER FAMILY WHO MADE A GREAT OUTCRY AND WOULD HAVE DEFENDED HER IF THEY COULD
5639-40744-0032 FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LADY MOTHER GIVE ME A WIFE WHO WOULD BE AN AGREEABLE COMPANION NOT ONE WHO WOULD DISGUST ME SO THAT WE MAY BOTH BEAR EVENLY AND WITH MUTUAL GOODWILL THE YOKE IMPOSED ON US BY HEAVEN INSTEAD OF PULLING THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AND FRETTING EACH OTHER TO DEATH
5639-40744-0033 HER BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE HELD HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MAIDS WITH WAX LIGHTS AND SILVER CANDLESTICKS
5639-40744-0034 AND ALL ROSE TO DO HER REVERENCE AS IF SOMETHING FROM HEAVEN HAD MIRACULOUSLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM BUT GAZING ON HER ENTRANCED WITH ADMIRATION NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS A SINGLE WORD TO HER
5639-40744-0035 SHE REFLECTED HOW NEAR SHE STOOD TO THE CRISIS WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED OR UNHAPPY FOREVER AND RACKED BY THE INTENSITY OF HER EMOTIONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOUR HER HEAD DROPPED AND SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SWOON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DISMAYED ASTAFFHANIA
5639-40744-0036 HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DESTINED PROTECTORS BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS INSENSIBLE SHE WAS NEAR MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD HE NOT COME TO HIMSELF
5639-40744-0037 KNOW THEN SON OF MY HEART THAT THIS FAINTING LADY IS YOUR REAL BRIDE I SAY REAL BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE WHO YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOU AND THE PORTRAIT WAS A PRETENCE
5639-40744-0038 JUST AT THAT MOMENT WHEN THE TEARS OF THE PITYING BEHOLDERS FLOWED FASTEST AND THEIR EJACULATIONS WERE THE MOST EXPRESSIVE OF DESPAIR LEOCADIA GAVE SIGNS OF RECOVERY AND BROUGHT BACK GLADNESS TO THE HEARTS OF ALL
5639-40744-0039 WHEN SHE CAME TO HER SENSES AND BLUSHING TO FIND HERSELF IN RODOLPHO'S ARMS WOULD HAVE DISENGAGED HERSELF NO SENORA HE SAID THAT MUST NOT BE STRIVE NOT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE ARMS OF HIM WHO HOLDS YOU IN THIS SOUL
5639-40744-0040 THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF A MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH ARE NOW SO PROPERLY RECOGNIZED
5639-40744-0041 NOR WAS RODOLPHO LESS SURPRISED THAN THEY AND THE BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF SO WONDERFUL A FACT HE BEGGED LOCAEDIA TO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENTICATED BY HIS PARENTS
5683-32865-0000 YOU YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LEAK
5683-32865-0001 SAID LORD CHELFORD ADDRESSING TO ME
5683-32865-0002 HE HAD HIS HAND UPON LEG'S SHOULDER
5683-32865-0003 THEY ARE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE BOTH COUSINS
5683-32865-0004 WHATEVER LORD CHELFORD SAID MISS BRANDON RECEIVED ME VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
5683-32865-0005 BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN LEEK WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY BROAD AND PALE
5683-32865-0006 AT DINNER LAKEL WAS EASY AND AMUSING
5683-32865-0007 I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WYLDER CHUCKLING BENIGNANTLY ON THAT OVER HIS SHOULDER
5683-32865-0008 I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REALS YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS
5683-32865-0009 AND HE PLACED IT IN A GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALLELOGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLY AMUSEMENT
5683-32865-0010 I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS SAID THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
5683-32865-0011 WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON HER ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES
5683-32865-0012 AND WYLDER LAUGHED TOO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOUR OF THE JOKES SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES ON LEAK BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DOROTHY ONLY REMARKING
5683-32865-0013 DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY
5683-32865-0014 HE'S NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY WAYS
5683-32865-0015 I HAD HAD A HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THAT
5683-32865-0016 OH I KNOW THAT'S LORRN BRANDON
5683-32865-0017 ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LEAKS
5683-32866-0000 MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TONY
5683-32866-0001 AND HE ADDED SOMETHING AND STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY
5683-32866-0002 BUT DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT RATHER FOOLISHLY
5683-32866-0003 IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORMED A REAL IDEA OF HER
5683-32866-0004 BY THIS TIME LORD CHELFORD AND WYLDER RETURNED AND DISGUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED AT MY WANT OF GENERALSHIP
5683-32866-0005 AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CANE TOWARD BRANDON HALL OVER HIS SHOULDERS
5683-32866-0006 YES SO THEY HAD SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORSE
5683-32866-0007 IF A FELLOW'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILDER HE'S BEELZEBUB AT ONCE
5683-32866-0008 BRACHTON'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU
5683-32866-0009 I DON'T KNOW AND CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FINE GENTLEMEN DEFINE WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMALE I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LIGHTS AND HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WEAKEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY
5683-32866-0010 WELL YOU KNOW RADIE WOMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS IT IS CONTRAST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND I'M SURE FROM WHAT BRACTON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY AND DORCAS LIKES HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED
5683-32866-0011 THEIR WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHEL AT LAST SAID I
5683-32866-0012 NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE RADIE FOR I REALLY DIDN'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING
5683-32866-0013 THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOONLIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOUGHS AND WITHERED LEAVES AND THE MOTTLED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED ODDLY ACROSS THE PALE FEATURES
5683-32866-0014 DON'T INSULT ME STANLEY BY TALKING AGAIN AS WE DID THIS MORNING
5683-32866-0015 WHAT I SAY IS RIDICULOUS ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
5683-32866-0016 MARK MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU AYE AND TOO BIG
5683-32866-0017 I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN'T TELL IT
5683-32866-0018 TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FEELING FEUDS
5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVE THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTHED MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEWBORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN OR ESPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
5683-32866-0020 THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED A GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
5683-32866-0021 MY BED WAS UNEXCEPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL LESS MODERN
5683-32866-0022 ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FASTENED TAPESTRY
5683-32866-0023 ALL THE FURNITURE BELONGED TO TWO OTHER TIMES
5683-32866-0024 I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN A GHOST STORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY IN A HAUNTED CHAIR
5683-32866-0025 HE DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNEY
5683-32866-0026 THIS I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY CHEROOT
5683-32866-0027 A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING AND CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
5683-32866-0028 THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC HIRSE PLUMES BLACK AND AWFUL
5683-32866-0029 SOMEHOW I HAD GROWN CARELESS
5683-32866-0030 BUT A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
5683-32879-0000 IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRANDON DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMANN'S FARM
5683-32879-0001 WELL SHE WAS DEAD THOUGH SHE HAD HAD A BAD NIGHT
5683-32879-0002 SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSTLING OF FAMILIAR DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF WELCOME
5683-32879-0003 WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS FIRES INTO THE DREADFUL CHALICE
5683-32879-0004 BUT POOR RACHEL LAKE HAD MORE THAN THAT STOICAL HYPOCRISY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SILENCE
5683-32879-0005 THIS TRANSIENT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOUR BEGUILING THE SENSES
5683-32879-0006 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEW TO RACHAEL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED HIS GREETING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORMER SELF
5683-32879-0007 RACHAEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED EYE STRUCK HER WITH A POWERFUL SURPRISE
5683-32879-0008 YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POOR DEAR RACHAEL
5683-32879-0009 ILL AND TROUBLED DEAR TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISERABLY JEALOUS
5683-32879-0010 POOR RACHAEL HER NATURE RECOILED FROM DECEIT AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TRUTH AS HE DARED
5683-32879-0011 AND SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK OF FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH
5683-32879-0012 THANK YOU RACHAEL MY COUSIN RACHAEL MY ONLY SISTER
5683-32879-0013 CHELFORD HAD A NOTE FROM MISTER WYLDER THIS MORNING ANOTHER NOTE HIS COMING DELAYED AND SOMETHING OF HIS HAVING TO SEE SOME PERSON WHO HAS ABROAD CONTINUED DORCAS AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
5683-32879-0014 YES SOMETHING EVERYTHING SAID RACHEL HURRIEDLY LOOKING FROWNINGLY AT A FLOWER WHICH SHE WAS TWIRLING HER FINGERS
5683-32879-0015 YES SIR SAID RACHEL
5683-32879-0016 BUT THE WAN ORACLE HAVING SPOKEN SHE SAT DOWN IN THE SAME SORT OF ABSTRACTION AGAIN BESIDE DORCAS AND SHE LOOKED FULL IN HER COUSIN'S EYES
5683-32879-0017 OF MARK WYLDER I SAY THIS HIS NAME HAS BEEN FOR YEARS HATEFUL TO ME AND RECENTLY IT HAS BECOME FRIGHTFUL AND YOU WILL PROMISE ME SIMPLY THIS THAT YOU WILL NEVER ASK ME TO SPEAK ABOUT HIM
5683-32879-0018 IT IS AN ANTIPATHY AN ANTIPATHY I CAN NOT GET OVER DEAR DORCAS YOU MAY THINK IT MADNESS BUT DON'T BLAME ME
5683-32879-0019 I HAVE VERY FEW TO LOVE YOU NOW AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LOVE ME AS I HAVE BEGUN TO LOVE YOU
5683-32879-0020 AND SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HER COUSIN'S NECK AND BRAVE RACHEL AT LAST BURSTS INTO TEARS
5683-32879-0021 DORCAS IN HER STRANGE VOICE WAS MOVED
5683-32879-0022 I LIKE YOU STILL RACH I'M SURE I'LL ALWAYS LIKE YOU
5683-32879-0023 YOU RESEMBLE ME RACHAEL YOU ARE FEARLESS AND INFLEXIBLE AND JUST

61-70968-0028 THE HEAD AND CHIEF OF THE RIOT THE NOTTINGHAM APPRENTICE WITH CLENCHED FISTS THREATENED MONTFIQUET
61-70968-0029 THE SQUIRE HELPED TO THRUST THEM ALL IN AND REACHED SWIFTLY HIMSELF

61-70970-0001 THERE BEFELL AN ANXIOUS INTERVIEW MISTRESS FITZOOTH ARGUING FOR AND AGAINST THE SQUIRE'S PROJECT OF A BREATH
61-70970-0002 MOST OF ALL ROBIN THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER WHAT WOULD HE FEEL

61-70970-0012 HERE HE WILL TEACH YOU A FEW TRICKS WHEN MORNING IS COME
61-70970-0013 THERE WAS A CHANCE TO ALTER HIS SLEEPING ROOM TO ONE NEARER TO GAMEWELL'S CHAMBER
61-70970-0014 PRESENTLY HE CROSSED THE FLOOR OF ITS ROOM WITH DECIDED STEP
61-70970-0015 WILL CRIED HE SOFTLY AND STUTELEY WHO HAD CHOSEN HIS COUCH ACROSS THE DOOR OF HIS YOUNG MASTER'S CHAMBER SPRANG UP AT ONCE TO ANSWER
61-70970-0016 WE WILL GO OUT TOGETHER TO THE BOWER THERE IS A WAY DOWN TO THE PORT FROM MY WINDOW

61-70970-0020 WILL WHISPERED ROBIN OPENING HIS DOORS AS HE SPOKE ARE YOU READY
61-70970-0021 THEY THEN RENEWED THEIR JOURNEY AND UNDER THE BETTER LIGHT MADE A SAFE CROSSING OF A STABLE ROOFS
61-70970-0022 AND ROBIN ENTERED THE HUT DRAGGING THE UNWILLING ESQUIRE AFTER HIM
61-70970-0023 TO BE NOT SO FOOLISH FRIEND SAID FITZOOTH CROSSLY
61-70970-0024 THEY MOVED THEREAFTER CAUTIOUSLY ABOUT THE HUT GROPING BEFORE AND ABOUT THEM TO FIND SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT WARRENTON HAD FULFILLED HIS MISSIONS
61-70970-0025 THEY WERE UPON THE VERGE OF AN OPEN TRAP IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE HUT AND STUTELEY HAD TRIPPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE REVERSED FLAP MOUTH OF THAT PIT
61-70970-0026 FITZOOTH'S HAND RESTED AT LAST UPON THE TOP RUNG OF A LADDER AND SLOWLY THE TRUTH CAME TO THEM
61-70970-0027 ROBINSON CAREFULLY DESCENDED THE LADDER AND FOUND HIMSELF SOON UPON FIRM ROCKY GROUND
61-70970-0028 STUTELEY WAS BY ITS SIDE IN A FLASH AND THEN THEY BOTH BEGAN FEELING ABOUT THEM TO ASCERTAIN THE SHAPE AND CHARACTER OF THIS VAULT
61-70970-0029 FROM THE BLACKNESS BEHIND THE LIGHT THEY HEARD A VOICE WARRENSON'S
61-70970-0030 SAVE ME ME MASTERS BUT YOU STARTLED ME RARELY
61-70970-0031 CRIED HE WAVING THE LANTHORN BEFORE HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WERE NO GHOSTS IN FRONT OF HIM

61-70970-0035 WARRENTON SPOKE THUS WITH SIGNIFICANCE TO SHOW ROBIN THAT HE WAS NOT TO THINK JEFFREY'S CLAIMS TO THE ESTATE WOULD BE PASSED UPON
61-70970-0036 ROBIN FITZOOTH SAW THAT HIS DOUBT OF WARRENTON HAD BEEN UNFAIR AND HE BECAME ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR HARBOURING THEM
61-70970-0037 HIS TONES RANG PLEASANTLY ON A WARRENTON'S EARS AND FORTHWITH A GOOD FELLOWSHIP WAS HERALDED BETWEEN THEM
61-70970-0038 THE OLD SERVANT TOLD HIM QUIETLY AS THEY CREPT BACK TO GAMEWELL THAT THIS PASSAGEWAY LED FROM THE HUT IN THE PLEASAUNCE TO SHERWOOD AND THAT JEFFREY FOR THIS TIME WAS HIDING WITH THE OUTLAWS IN THE FOREST
61-70970-0039 HE IMPLORES US TO BE DISCREET AS THE GRAVE IN THIS MATTER FOR IN SOOTH HIS LIFE IS IN THE HOLLOW OF THEIR HANDS
61-70970-0040 THEY REGAINED THEIR APARTMENTS APPARENTLY WITHOUT DISTURBING THE HOUSEHOLD OF GENWELL
672-122797-0000 OUT IN THE WOOD STOOD A NEAT LITTLE FIR TREE
672-122797-0001 THE PLACE HE HAD WAS A VERY GOOD ONE THE SUN SHONE ON HIM AS TO FRESH AIR THERE WAS ENOUGH OF THAT AND ROUND HIM GREW MANY LARGE SIZED COMRADES PINE AS WELL AS FIRS
672-122797-0002 HE DID NOT THINK OF THE WARM SUN AND OF THE FRESH AIR HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE LITTLE COTTAGE CHILDREN THAT RAN ROUND AND PRATTLED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WOODS LOOKING FOR WILD STRAWBERRIES
672-122797-0003 BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE WOULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR
672-122797-0004 IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY GLITTERING ON THE GROUND A HARE WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING ON AND JUMP RIGHT OVER THE LITTLE TREE
672-122797-0005 OH OH THAT MADE HIM SO ANGRY
672-122797-0006 TO GROW AND GROW TO GET OLDER AND BE TALL TOO THE TREE THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL THING IN THE WORLD
672-122797-0007 IN AUTUMN THE WOODCUTTERS ALWAYS CAME AND FELLED SOME OF THE LATEST TREES
672-122797-0008 THIS HAPPENED EVERY YEAR AND THE YOUNG FIR TREE THAT HAD NOW GROWN TO A VERY COMELY SIZE TREMBLED AT THE SIGHT FOR THE MAGNIFICENT GREAT TREES FELL TO THE EARTH WITH NOISE AND CRACKING THE BRANCHES WERE LOPPED OFF AND THE TREES LOOKED LONG AND BARE THEY WERE HARDLY TO BE RECOGNIZED AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARTS AND THE HORSES DRAGGED THEM OUT OF THE WATER
672-122797-0009 HAVE YOU NOT MET THEM BEFORE
672-122797-0010 REJOICE IN THY GRACE SAID THE SUNBEAMS
672-122797-0011 AND THEN IT HAPPENS THEN
672-122797-0012 I WOULD FAIN KNOW IF I AM DESTINED FOR SO GLORIOUS A CAREER CRIED THE TREE TREMBLING
672-122797-0013 I AM NOW TALL AND MY BRANCHES SPREAD LIKE THE OTHERS THAT WERE CARRIED OFF LAST YEAR WHEN
672-122797-0014 WERE I THEN ALREADY ON THE CART
672-122797-0015 WERE I IN THE WARM ROOM WITH ALL THOSE SPLENDOR AND MAGNIFICENCE
672-122797-0016 YES THEN SOMETHING MUCH BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDER WILL SURELY FOLLOW OR WHEREFORE SHOULD THEY THUS ORNAMENT ME
672-122797-0017 SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDER MUST FOLLOWED BUT WHAT
672-122797-0018 REJOICE IN OUR PRESENCE SAID THE SEA AND THE SUNLIGHT
672-122797-0019 REJOICE IN THINE OWN FRESH YOUTH
672-122797-0020 BUT THE TREE DID NOT REJOICE AT ALL HE GREW AND GREW AND WAS GREEN WITH WINTER AND SUMMER
672-122797-0021 AND TOWARD CHRISTMAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS CAST DOWN
672-122797-0022 THE AXE STRUCK DEEP INTO THE VERY PITH THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANG IT WAS LIKE A SWOON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATE FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPRUNG UP
672-122797-0023 HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THEIR LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANY MORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS
672-122797-0024 TO DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE
672-122797-0025 THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT MAN IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
672-122797-0026 THERE TOO ARE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WORTH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO
672-122797-0027 THE SERVANTS AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LADIES DECORATED THIS
672-122797-0028 THIS EVENING THEY ALL STOOD
672-122797-0029 HOW IT WILL SHINE ALL EVENING
672-122797-0030 PERHAPS THE LITTLE TREES FROM THE FOREST WILL COME TO LOOK AT ME
672-122797-0031 IT BLAZED UP FAMOUSLY HELP HELPS
672-122797-0032 CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT FIRE
672-122797-0033 AN STORY
672-122797-0034 THE STORY CRIED THE CHILDREN DRAWING A LITTLE FAT MAN TOWARD THE TREE
672-122797-0035 WHAT I SHALL TELL ONLY ONE STORY
672-122797-0036 HUMPY DUMPY FELL DOWNSTAIRS AND YET HE MARRIED THE PRINCESSES
672-122797-0037 THAT'S THE WAY OF THE LORD
672-122797-0038 THOUGHT THE FIR TREE AND BELIEVED IT ALL BECAUSE THE MAN WHO TOLD THE STORY WAS SO GREAT LOOKING WELL WELL
672-122797-0039 I WON'T TREMBLE T MORROW THOUGHT THE FIR TREE
672-122797-0040 AND THIS WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT
672-122797-0041 IN THE MORNING THE SERVANT AND THE HOUSEMAID CAME INTO
672-122797-0042 BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRCASE INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM
672-122797-0043 WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE MAN
672-122797-0044 HAD HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIE
672-122797-0045 TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN ONE CORNER OUT OF THE WAY
672-122797-0046 TIS NOW WINTER OUT OF DOORS WHAT THE TREE
672-122797-0047 HOW A KIND MAN IS AFTER ALL
672-122797-0048 IF IT ONLY WERE NOT SO DEEP HERE AND SO TERRIBLY LONELY
672-122797-0049 ' SQUEAK SQUEAK
672-122797-0050 THEY SNUFFED ABOUT THE FIR TREE AND RUSTLED AMONG THE TREES
672-122797-0051 I AM BY NO MEANS OLD SAID THE FIRRY TREE
672-122797-0052 OH THERE'S MANY A ONE CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN I AM
672-122797-0053 THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY NUMEROUS
672-122797-0054 I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE CHILD
672-122797-0055 AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LISTENED AND SAYS
672-122797-0056 SAID THE FIR TREE THINKING OUT WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF RELATED
672-122797-0057 YES IN REALITY THOSE WERE HAPPY TIME
672-122797-0058 WHO IS IT HUMPY DUMPY ASKED THE MICE
672-122797-0059 ONLY THAT ONE ANSWER THE TREE
672-122797-0060 IT IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL STORY
672-122797-0061 DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BACON AND TALLOW CANDLES CAN'T YOU TELL ANY LARDER BOYS
672-122797-0062 NO SAID THE TRAIN
672-122797-0063 THEN GOOD BY SAID THE RATS AND THEY WENT AWAY
672-122797-0064 AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALSO BUT THE TREE SIGHED AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN THE SLEEK LITTLE MICE SAT ROUND ME AND LISTENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM
672-122797-0065 NOW THAT TOO TOO IS OVER
672-122797-0066 ONLY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT
672-122797-0067 THE TRUNKS ARE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE
672-122797-0068 BUT IT WAS NOT OF THE FIR TREE THAT THEY MEANT
672-122797-0069 IT IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG WEEDS AND NETTLES
672-122797-0070 THE GOLDEN STAR OF TINZEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE
672-122797-0071 IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MERRIAT CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS AROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
672-122797-0072 AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES HERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE
672-122797-0073 THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY IN THE LARGE BREWING COPPER AND IT SIGHED SO DEEPLY
672-122797-0074 HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE DAY GONE THE STORY AT AN END
6829-68769-0000 KENNETH AND BETH REFRAINED FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD BILL ROGERS'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORGING A CHECK
6829-68769-0001 IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM AT THE STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
6829-68769-0002 BUT I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER
6829-68769-0003 IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PRETEND A GIRL HE LOVED
6829-68769-0004 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY THAT SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
6829-68769-0005 HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT A COST
6829-68769-0006 IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGER CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68769-0007 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
6829-68769-0008 FAIRVIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY STREET
6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE SEIZED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
6829-68769-0010 WE WISH TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWERED KENNETH DO
6829-68769-0011 I'M RUNNING FOR REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REPUBLICAN TICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
6829-68769-0012 YOU SAY THAT'S DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING HIS DEMEANOUR
6829-68769-0013 MAY WE SEE GATES AT ONCE ASKED KENETH
6829-68769-0014 THEY FOLLOWED THAT JAILER ALONG A SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES
6829-68769-0015 SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARNING FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AN I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORTH DRYIN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
6829-68769-0016 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HERE'S PETERS TOM
6829-68769-0017 WORSE TOM WORSE MORE'N EVER REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY
6829-68769-0018 MISS DE GRAF SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THEIR PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
6829-68769-0019 AND SORRY WE HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE JAIL
6829-68769-0020 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID KATES IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A BENCH HERE
6829-68769-0021 A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WAS PAUL GATES WITH STEADY GRAY EYES AN INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH
6829-68769-0022 WE HAVE HEARD SOME OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT
6829-68769-0023 I DIDN'T STOP TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT
6829-68769-0024 OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER
6829-68769-0025 THE ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEAD HER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN
6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN HIS NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
6829-68769-0027 WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE CHEQUE AS KENNETH
6829-68769-0028 HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL OF THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERN
6829-68769-0029 IT'S A STOCK COMPANY ENRIQUE
6829-68769-0030 I WAS A BIG KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0031 AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE TIME
6829-68769-0032 I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARSHALL NEVER EVEN CHECKED ME
6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO SEE THE GIRL UNFEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
6829-68769-0034 I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU DEAR
6829-68769-0035 HE WON'T BE MUCH BUT I'M GRATEFUL TO FIND A FRIEND
6829-68769-0036 THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THEIR OFFICE
6829-68769-0037 I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN YOUR DAY
6829-68769-0038 AND IT RUNS A MAN'S DISPOSITION
6829-68769-0039 HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACIOUSLY BUT MOTIONLED THEM TO BE SEATED
6829-68769-0040 SOME GIRL HAS BEEN OUT HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
6829-68769-0041 I'M NOT ELECTIONEERING YET NOW
6829-68769-0042 WHY WELL SIR WHAT ABOUT HIM
6829-68769-0043 AND HE DESERVES A TREAT IN STATE'S PRISON
6829-68769-0044 IT HAD COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS IN ANNOYANCE
6829-68769-0045 I'LL PAY ALL THE COSTS BEFORE
6829-68769-0046 YOU'RE FOOLISH WHY COULD YOU DO ALL THIS
6829-68769-0047 I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARKALL
6829-68769-0048 GIVE ME A CHEQUE FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGED CHECK AND QUASH FURTHER PROCEEDING
6829-68769-0049 HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP THE YOUNG GATES
6829-68769-0050 BETH UNEASY AT HIS SILENCE NUDGED HIMSELF
6829-68769-0051 THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS STUPID FACE
6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE PUT THAT FORGED CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
6829-68769-0053 AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS
6829-68771-0000 SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORD'S AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY HOURS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
6829-68771-0001 ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMEN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVASS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICTS TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
6829-68771-0002 THE WEAK AID CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM OPPOSITION
6829-68771-0003 THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS THING
6829-68771-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS REYNOLDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ERECT HOPKINS
6829-68771-0005 THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH REYNOLDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED HIM PERSONALLY
6829-68771-0006 AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN ON THE BUGGY
6829-68771-0007 THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S MILITARY LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
6829-68771-0008 THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN ADOPTING MISTER FORBES
6829-68771-0009 LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE COURSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
6829-68771-0010 THE FAIRVIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISGRACE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESTS
6829-68771-0011 TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIAL REPAST SEEMED TO BE SERVED
6829-68771-0012 THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBOURS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUEST
6829-68771-0013 THE ATTENDANCE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FORESEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THAT FIGHT
6829-68771-0014 WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTENDANCE BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING THE COUSIN
6829-68771-0015 DON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS
6829-68771-0016 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE OLD LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER ESPECIAL FAVORITE
6829-68771-0017 THE NEWSPAPER LED THE WAY AND BETH FOLLOWED
6829-68771-0018 FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND A PLEASANT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
6829-68771-0019 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST AND PLAIN BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP
6829-68771-0020 THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND REPLIED NO NO MISS BETH I'M ELIZABETH PARSONS
6829-68771-0021 BUT IT CAN'T BE PROTESTING THE GIRL
6829-68771-0022 I ATTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD MENDING YOU KNOW AND CARE TO THE LINEN
6829-68771-0023 AND YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE IS YOUR HOME
6829-68771-0024 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AS HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITOR
6829-68771-0025 SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROCKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BET
6829-68771-0026 SHE ELIZA PARSONS SHOOK HER HEAD
6829-68771-0027 THEY THEY STRIKE ME IN SOME WAY AND I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
6829-68771-0028 SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION THAT SHE ATTRACTED
6829-68771-0029 BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELIZA SURPASSED HER IN THE NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT
6829-68771-0030 HER MIND WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
6829-68771-0031 HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAID'S LIPS
6829-68771-0032 HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORM MIGHT REPRESS AN EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
6829-68771-0033 SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT LET HER VISITOR CATCH HER BREATH
6829-68771-0034 I WISH I WAS MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY
6829-68771-0035 WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE ME
6829-68771-0036 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK
6930-75918-0000 CONCORD RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE CONTENTS
6930-75918-0001 THE ENGLISH FOURETED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
6930-75918-0002 CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESSE EVERYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
6930-75918-0003 FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATIONS WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UNHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCE
6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD ALL BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPENED FOR THEM
6930-75918-0005 THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS ARMS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN A HARASSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FATHER
6930-75918-0007 YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS AM AND
6930-75918-0008 HOW CAN YOU IMAGINE WHY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO VIOLENT I SUSPECT
6930-75918-0009 IT IS YOU WHO ARE MISTAKEN RAOUL I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE TIME
6930-75918-0010 I CAN PERCEIVE HIS LOVE CLEARLY ENOUGH
6930-75918-0011 IM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE COUNT
6930-75918-0012 IT IS ANNOYOUS THEN
6930-75918-0013 OF THOSE VERY TERMS I EVEN ADDED MORE
6930-75918-0014 BUT CONTINUED RAOUL NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS BROTHER HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AND INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
6930-75918-0015 THUS IT IS THAT THE HONOR OF FREE IS SAVED OUR COUNTRY OUR MASTERS AND OUR OWN
6930-75918-0016 YES I NEED REPOSE MANY MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
6930-75918-0017 BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE RAH COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT
6930-75918-0018 THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLIT AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERY
6930-75918-0019 UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORM AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGSTONES
6930-75918-0020 BRAGELONNE WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVIL SLUMBERS OF MANI SEMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT
6930-76324-0000 GOLIATH MAKES EVERY DISCOVERY
6930-76324-0001 THEY WERE PROBABLY NO NEARER THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM
6930-76324-0002 THE POOR LITTLE THINGS CRIED CYNTHIA THINK OF THEM HAVE BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS

6930-76324-0011 THEY'D WORRY ME TERRIBLY AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKED LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEME SIN
6930-76324-0012 WE'LL COME IN HERE THIS AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOTH ON AND HAVE A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING
6930-76324-0013 IT CAN'T HURT ANYTHING I'M SURE IF WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL
6930-76324-0014 THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC KING
6930-76324-0015 SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PARAPHERNALIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND A DUST PAN TO THE OUTFIT
6930-76324-0016 THE LURE PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A YOUNG KITTEN MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
6930-76324-0017 OH LET HIM COME AWAY SHE URGED I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSE
6930-76324-0018 HE MAKES IT SORT OF COESIER
6930-76324-0019 AND NOW LET'S DUST THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES
6930-76324-0020 NOT LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM
6930-76324-0021 THE SURFACE DUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH
6930-76324-0022 THEN SHE SUDDENLY STOPPED
6930-76324-0023 AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT TO AS USUAL
6930-76324-0024 THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLE LIGHTNING IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD
6930-76324-0025 WHY IT'S GOLIATH AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING UP
6930-76324-0026 ISN'T HE THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO BAD CORNERS
6930-76324-0027 FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND SCURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FIGHTING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER
6930-76324-0028 WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH SIXTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
6930-81414-0000 NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY BUT NOT IN REALITY
6930-81414-0001 I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW KATHIR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
6930-81414-0002 ONWARD SAID A SHORT VOICE
6930-81414-0003 NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE LIGHT
6930-81414-0004 THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHY THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
6930-81414-0005 WHAT WAS THAT TO
6930-81414-0006 WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEAR DISTINCTLY UPON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
6930-81414-0007 NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST TO WHICH IT WOULD BE ATTACHED
6930-81414-0008 IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND IN DEATH
6930-81414-0009 I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH A PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS KATIR
6930-81414-0010 WAS A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT
6930-81414-0011 THAT FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHERE
6930-81414-0012 SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNISED AS VOLTAIRE'S KATIR
6930-81414-0013 I HAD SCARCELY KNOW WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
6930-81414-0014 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND THE HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLORED
6930-81414-0015 I DO NOT KNOW FOR I AM DAZED BEWILDERED
6930-81414-0016 BUT IT IS KAFIR'S KNIFE
6930-81414-0017 I KNOW HE HAD IT IS THIS VERY EVENING
6930-81414-0018 I REMEMBERED SAYING HAVE WE BEEN TALKING TOGETHER
6930-81414-0019 VOLTAIRE PICKED UP EVERYTHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
6930-81414-0020 I SAY YOU WILL KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
6930-81414-0021 A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHES INTO MY MIND
6930-81414-0022 I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A MAN'S POWER
6930-81414-0023 PERCHANCE TOO KAFFIR'S HEAD MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
6930-81414-0024 MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEFT ME A
6930-81414-0025 MY POSITION WAS TOO DESPERATE
6930-81414-0026 MY OVERBROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST
6930-81414-0027 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE DISTINCTLY
7021-79730-0000 THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT I
7021-79730-0001 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS MEASURE AND DESIGN
7021-79730-0002 BY REASON AND SUFFERING
7021-79730-0003 AS THE CHAISE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE MASTER DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT AND VEXATIONS AND ILL HUMOUR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY
7021-79730-0004 THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHAISE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARIAN CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE
7021-79730-0005 SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT TO MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
7021-79730-0006 THE MOTHER IN MANAGING HER CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
7021-79730-0007 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU UP SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
7021-79730-0008 BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNHAPPY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
7021-79730-0009 IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASONS AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTIONS CANNOT BE OVERRATED
7021-79740-0000 TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TREATING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
7021-79740-0001 DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MORIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
7021-79740-0002 NOW DELIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THEIR CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
7021-79740-0003 TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE COMBINATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
7021-79740-0004 YOU HAVE COME ANDELLA AND STELLA WITH THE NAME OF JANE'S DOLL TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT
7021-79740-0005 AND I AM VERY GLAD
7021-79740-0006 I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY VERY GOOD GIRL ANDELLA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
7021-79740-0007 THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JOHN
7021-79740-0008 FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR AND THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
7021-79740-0009 THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLLS INTO THE PARLOUR
7021-79740-0010 DELIA CAME TO THE PARLOUR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSALIE HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD
7021-79740-0011 SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND BOUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE
7021-79740-0012 SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHINGS YOU
7021-79740-0013 PUT THESE PLAYTHINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR SEEING THEM OUT
7021-79740-0014 AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE
7021-79759-0000 NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPROVEMENTS
7021-79759-0001 THAT THIS IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
7021-79759-0002 THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE EMOTIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
7021-79759-0003 VASTLY IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
7021-79759-0004 WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION AND MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND
7021-79759-0005 THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SOUL MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
7021-85628-0000 THEN ANDERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
7021-85628-0001 HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDOS
7021-85628-0002 HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKKNAFE
7021-85628-0003 NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH A HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKKNIFE
7021-85628-0004 YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDERSEN
7021-85628-0005 SEEING THAT I AM SO FRIGHTENED I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
7021-85628-0006 IM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDERS
7021-85628-0007 AND SHE TOOK ANDER'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREEVER HE WENT
7021-85628-0008 FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A FRIEND WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
7021-85628-0009 AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES AND LONG ROWS
7021-85628-0010 ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND A RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
7021-85628-0011 THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET ANDER SET IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
7021-85628-0012 BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND I WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF
7021-85628-0013 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE SHAPE WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
7021-85628-0014 HE ONLY SHOOK HIS FOOT
7021-85628-0015 WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCE AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
7021-85628-0016 THAT'S A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID
7021-85628-0017 SO IT IS SAID HEERS
7021-85628-0018 AND IT IS MADE OF THE MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
7021-85628-0019 WITH ONE JUMP ANDERS GOT OUT IN HIS CHAIR
7021-85628-0020 I DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
7021-85628-0021 HE STILL HELD ONTO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED TO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
7021-85628-0022 AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD DOWN AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
7021-85628-0023 BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS HAND FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID
7021-85628-0024 ANDER'S HAIR GREW RED
7021-85628-0025 BUT HIS MOTHER HUGGS HIM CLOSE
7021-85628-0026 NO MY LITTLE MOTHER SHE SAID
7021-85628-0027 IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAPS
7127-75946-0000 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH IS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT
7127-75946-0001 A AH VERY WELL
7127-75946-0002 LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AU COURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE INTERRUPTED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
7127-75946-0003 GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT ANON AND VILLAROIS TOOK THEIR LEAVE
7127-75946-0004 CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO NOT WHAT
7127-75946-0005 WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LEE
7127-75946-0006 HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS A CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
7127-75946-0007 IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWNED AND
7127-75946-0008 DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYAL CONTEMPT
7127-75946-0009 NOT ON ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME
7127-75946-0010 YOUR MAJESTY'S PLAN BUT IN THIS AFFAIR IS
7127-75946-0011 YOU WILL TAKE THIS FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
7127-75946-0012 THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AND DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF COQUETRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
7127-75946-0013 THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILET BY TEN O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
7127-75946-0014 THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT DAIS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATRE OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTIONS
7127-75946-0015 AND SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PEACE AND ORDER SPRING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
7127-75946-0016 THE SEASONS THE ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUADRILLE WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DANCE
7127-75946-0017 HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLOURED SILKEN HOSE OF MILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
7127-75946-0018 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BUOYANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND THEY DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEM TO SOAR ALONG
7127-75946-0019 YES SIR IT IS SUPPRESSED
7127-75946-0020 AND FAR FROM IT SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HAVING GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINED IT
7127-75946-0021 YES SIRE AND READY DRESSING FOR THE BALLET
7127-75946-0022 SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SIMILAR ZEAL THAT HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELDS OF BATTLE
7127-75946-0023 THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY PERSON PRESENT
7127-75946-0024 MONSIEUR WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATCH
7127-75946-0025 THE BALLET BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN DOUBTFUL
7127-75946-0026 WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATRES SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
7127-75946-0027 DISDAINFUL OF A SUCCESS AT WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKED PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
7127-75946-0028 BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND AMAZEMENT SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
7127-75946-0029 THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN THE QUADRILLE CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL
7127-75947-0000 EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY AT HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BEDIMMED
7127-75947-0001 UPON THIS MADAME DEIGNED TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE COMTE OBSERVING AND
7127-75947-0002 DO NOT THINK SO SHE REPLIED WITH INDIFFERENCE
7127-75947-0003 YES THE CHARACTER WHICH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS HAD ASSUMED IS IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH YOUR OWN
7127-75947-0004 EXPLAIN YOURSELF YOU
7127-75947-0005 I ALLUDE TO THE GODDESS'
7127-75947-0006 THE PRINCESS INQUIRED NO ONE
7127-75947-0007 SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR TO WHICH SHE WAS PRESENTLY GONE TO DANCE
7127-75947-0008 THE ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART IT WOUNDED HIM MORTALLY
7127-75947-0009 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATER BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FROM LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART
7127-75947-0010 WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THIS YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISED IN THE MIDST OF IDEAS SHE WAS DESIROUS OF CONCEALING FROM HERSELF
7127-75947-0011 REMAIN I IMPLORE YOU THE EVENING IS NOT LOVELY
7127-75947-0012 INDEED WHAT
7127-75947-0013 I REMEMBER NOW BUT I CONGRATULATE MYSELF DO YOU LOVE ANY ONE
7127-75947-0014 FORGIVE ME I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING A THOUSAND TIMES FORGIVE ME MADAME HAS RIGHT QUITE RIGHT THIS BRUTAL EXILE HAS COMPLETELY TURNED MY BRAIN
7127-75947-0015 THERE CANNOT BE A DOUBT THEY RECEIVED YOU KINDLY FOR IN FACT YOU RETURNED WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION
7127-75947-0016 NOW MADEMOISELLE WHY HAVE I NOT A DEVOTED SISTER OR A TRUE FRIEND SUCH AS YOURSELF
7127-75947-0017 WHAT ALREADY HERE THEY HAD SAID TO HER

7127-75947-0023 IT IS TOO DIFFICULT REPLIED MADEMOISELLE DE TOURNAY CHARADE LAUGHING LOUDLY
7127-75947-0024 LOOK YONDER DO YOU NOT SEE THE MOON STILL RISING SILVERING THE TOPMOST BRANCHES OF THE CHESTNUTS AND THE OAKS
7127-75947-0025 EXQUISITELY SOFT TURF OF THE WOODS THE HAPPINESS WHICH YOUR FRIENDSHIP CONFERS UPON ME
7127-75947-0026 WELL SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TOURNAYCHALET I ALSO THINK A GOOD DEAL BUT I TAKE CARE
7127-75947-0027 TO SAY NOTHING SAID MONTALAIS SO THAT WHEN MADEMOISELLE DE TOURNAY CHARON THINKS ATHENAY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS IT
7127-75947-0028 QUICK QUICK THEN AMONG THE HIGH REED GRASS SAID MONTALAIS STOOP AHENE YOU ARE SO TALL
7127-75947-0029 THE YOUNG GIRLS HAD INDEED MADE THEMSELVES SMALL INDEED AND VISIBLE
7127-75947-0030 SHE WAS HERE JUST NOW SIR SAID THE COUNT
7127-75947-0031 YOU ARE POSSIBLY THEN
7127-75947-0032 YES BUT PERHAPS I FRIGHTENED HER IN YOUR WAY
7127-75947-0033 HOW IS IT LA VALLIERE SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TONASCHANANT THAT THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE SPOKE OF YOU AS LOUISE
7127-75947-0034 THAT SEEMS THE KING WILL NOT CONSENT TO IT
7127-75947-0035 GOD GRACIOUS HAS THE KING ANY RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN MATTERS OF THAT KIND
7127-75947-0036 I TOOK MY CONSENT
7127-75947-0037 OH I AM SPEAKING SERIOUSLY REPLIED MONTALAIS AND MY OPINION IN THIS CASE IS QUITE AS GOOD AS THE COUNT'S I SUPPOSE IS IT NOT LOUISE
7127-75947-0038 LET US RIDE THEN SAID ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR SILK DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE THICKEST COVERT OF THE PARK
7127-75947-0039 IN FACT THE SOUND OF MOSDAMS AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTAIN CAVALIERS
7127-75947-0040 IN THIS WAY THE FETE OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FETE ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER IN THE BRAKE THE PHEASANT ON A BRANCH THE FOX IN ITS HOLE WERE ALL LISTENING
7176-88083-0000 ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOR SCATTERED INTO BROAD SPLASHES
7176-88083-0001 THE MERGANSER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF IRIDESCENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PENCILED AND BLACK AND WHITE AND A BREAST OF RICH CHESTNUT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK
7176-88083-0002 HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW TOOTHED RIDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
7176-88083-0003 BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS AND THE EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS
7176-88083-0004 BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMORANT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH ITS SURFACE
7176-88083-0005 ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR THIS PERCH
7176-88083-0006 IT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
7176-88083-0007 BUT SUCH IS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS ENGORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY
7176-88083-0008 IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO TOO SOON
7176-88083-0009 THE GREAT HULK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY RETRIEVE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND
7176-88083-0010 THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE IN HER JAWS AND TROTTED IT INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT
7176-88083-0011 IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM AROUND HIS STRAINED GULLET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
7176-88083-0012 THE HAWK ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT AND MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED
7176-88083-0013 LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE WONDERFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
7176-88083-0014 THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THAT SURFACE
7176-88083-0015 ALMOST INSTANTLY HE WAS BROUGHT TO THE TOP
7176-88083-0016 STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK GLIDED FROM HIS PERCH AND DART AFTER HIM
7176-88083-0017 BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY ON
7176-88083-0018 AND THIS FREQUENTER OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOUR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
7176-88083-0019 AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOUT THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD
7176-88083-0020 WHERE THE FLAMES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH
7176-88083-0021 BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
7176-88083-0022 THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGGED IN THE PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED
7176-88083-0023 HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CASTE BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEASTING
7176-88083-0024 THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT GOT JUST IN THAT CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY
7176-88083-0025 AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN ON THE BANK
7176-88083-0026 THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHUCK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING
7176-88083-0027 THEN THE LIEUTENANT PARTED FROM THE LINE
7176-92135-0000 HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY EXCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO A SYMPOSIUM ON THE PRICE OF GOLF BALLS
7176-92135-0001 IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL PROBABLY WILL SAY SO
7176-92135-0002 BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMATIST HAVE HIS MOMENTS
7176-92135-0003 YOUR PLAY SHALL BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE
7176-92135-0004 FRANKLY I CANNOT ALWAYS PAY
7176-92135-0005 BUT SUPPOSE SHE SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH
7176-92135-0006 I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMEN AND BUT PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
7176-92135-0007 ANYHOW IT'S JOLLY EXCITING AND I CAN DO THE DIALOGUE ALREADY
7176-92135-0008 LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGES CRAFT IS
7176-92135-0009 AND SHE SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HOMILY ON SOLILOQUY
7176-92135-0010 HIM TO BE OR NOT
7176-92135-0011 NOW THE OBJECT OF THIS SOLILOQUY IS CLEAR
7176-92135-0012 INDEED IRRESOLUTION BEING THE KEYNOTE OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINEST SHADES OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEANING
7176-92135-0013 WE MODERNS THEREFORE SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT
7176-92135-0014 IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHT OF A CERTAIN CHARACTERS SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STAGE TECHNIQUE HOW SHALL A SOLILOQUY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY
7176-92135-0015 AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN OPHELIA MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON COMMITTTAL OF THAT SORT
7176-92135-0016 THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT FOR IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF
7176-92135-0017 IN THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE ARTIST INTO HIS CONFIDENCE
7176-92135-0018 IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS HIM WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL
7176-92135-0019 I WANT DOUBLE O NINE HELLO
7176-92135-0020 DOUBLE NINETY TWO THREE ELSINORE DOUBLE NOT YES HELLO IS THAT YOU HORATIO HAMLET SPEAKING
7176-92135-0021 AND SAY I'VE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT THIS BUSINESS
7176-92135-0022 TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER TIS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO SUFFER THE SLINGS AND ARROWS WHAT NO HAMLET SPEAKINGS
7176-92135-0023 YOU GAVE ME DOUBLE FIVE I WANT DOUBLE NINE HELLO IS THAT YOU HORATIO HAMLET SPEAKING OF
7176-92135-0024 TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER TIS NOBLEL
7176-92135-0025 IT IS TO LET HAMLET IF THAT HAPPEN TO BE THE NAME OF YOUR CHARACTER ENTER WITH A SMALL DOG PET FALCON MONGOOSE TAME BEAR OR WHATEVER ANIMAL IS MOST IN KEEPING WITH THE PART AND CONFIDE IN THIS ANIMAL SUCH SORROWS HOPES OR SECRET HISTORY AS THE AUDIENCE HAS NOT TO KNOW
7176-92135-0026 ENTER HAMLET WITH HIS FAVOURITE BAARHOUND
7176-92135-0027 LADY LARKSBORO STARTS SUDDENLY AND TURNS TOWARD HIM
7176-92135-0028 LARKSPUR BITS ME AGAIN THIS MORNING FOR THE THIRD TIME
7176-92135-0029 I WANT TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL SWINE
7176-92135-0030 ENTER LADY ARTHUR FLUFFANO'S
7176-92135-0031 AND THERE YOU ARE YOU WILL OF COURSE APPRECIATE THAT THE UNFINISHED SENTENCES NOT ONLY SAVE TIME BUT ALSO MAKE THE MANOEUVRE VERY MUCH MORE NATURAL
7176-92135-0032 WHILE YOU MAY BE WONDERING ARE YOU TO BEGIN YOUR MASTERPIECE
7176-92135-0033 RELAPSES INTO SILENCE WITH THE REST OF THE EVENING
7176-92135-0034 THE DUCHESS OF SOUTHBRIDGE TO LORD REGGIE SO REGGIE WHAT DID YOU SAY
7176-92135-0035 THEN LORD TUPPINAY WELL WHAT ABOUT AUCTION
7176-92135-0036 THE CROWD DRIFTS OFF LEAVING THE HERO AND HEROINE ALONE IN THE MIDST OF THE STAGE AND THEN YOU CAN BEGIN
7176-92135-0037 THEN IS THE TIME TO INTRODUCE A GIRL ON THE STAGE
7176-92135-0038 A STAGE WHEEL IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVES TO THE AUDIENCE THAT THE ACTORS EVEN WHEN CALLED CHARLES HOLTREE OR OWEN NAIRS ARE REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME
7176-92135-0039 A TEA PLEASE MATTHEWS BUTLER IMPASSIVELY
7176-92135-0040 HOSTESS REPLACES A LUMP AND INCLINES EMPTY TEAPOT OVER TRAY FOR A MOMENT THEN HANDS HIM A CUP PAINTED BROWN INSIDE THUS DECEIVING THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE TELESCOPE IN THE UPPER CIRCLE
7176-92135-0041 REENTER BUTLER AND THREE FOOTMEN WHO IMPROVE THE TEA THINGS HOSTESS TO GUEST
7176-92135-0042 IN NOVELS THE HERO HAS OFTEN PUSHED HIS MEALS AWAY UNTASTED BUT NO STEVE HERO WOULD DO ANYTHING SO UNNATURAL AS THIS
7176-92135-0043 TWO BITES ARE MADE AND THE BREAD IS CRUMBLED WITH AN AIR OF GREAT EAGERNESS INDEED ONE FEELS THAT IN REAL LIFE THE GUEST WOULD CLUTCH HOLD OF THE FOOTMAN AND SAY HALF AN O OLD CHAP I HAVEN'T NEARLY FINISHED BUT THE ACTOR IS BETTER SCHOOLED THAN THIS
7176-92135-0044 BUT THAT IS THE CIGARETTE WHICH CHIEFLY HAS BROUGHT THE MODERN DRAMA TO ITS PRESENT STATE OF PERFECTION
7176-92135-0045 LORD JOHN TAKING OUT GOLD CIGARETTE CASE FROM HIS LEFT HAND UPPER WAISTCOAT
7729-102255-0000 THE BOGUS LEGEND NUMBERED THIRTY SIX MEMBERS
7729-102255-0001 THIS WAS AT THE MARCH ELECTION EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE
7729-102255-0002 AND SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STATES GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES
7729-102255-0003 FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT SOME TIME EASILY TURN THE SCALE
7729-102255-0004 THE THREE STATE MEN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEIR COURAGE AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD ITS SECRET COMBINATION THE TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS THE LEGISLATURE THE BOGUS LAWS THE COURTS THE MILITIA OFFICERS THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMY
7729-102255-0005 THIS WAS A FORMABLE ARRAY OF ADVANTAGES SLAVERY WAS PLAYING WITH LIGHTED DICE
7729-102255-0006 COMING IN BY WAY OF THE MISSOURI RIVER TOWNS HE FELL FIRST AMONG BORDER RUFFIAN COMPANIONSHIP AND INFLUENCES AND PERHAPS HAVING HIS INCLINATIONS ALREADY MOLDED BY HIS WASHINGTON INSTRUCTIONS HIS EARLY IMPRESSIONS WERE DECIDEDLY ADVERSE TO THE FREE STATE CAUSE
7729-102255-0007 HIS RECEPTION SPEECH AT WESTPORT IN WHICH HE MAINTAINED THE LEGALITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND HIS DETERMINATION TO ENFORCE THEIR LAWS DELIGHTED HIS PRO SLAVERY ADITORS
7729-102255-0008 ALL THE TERRITORIAL DIGNITARIES WERE PRESENT GOVERNOR SHANNON PRESIDED JOHN CALHOUN THE SURVEYOR GENERAL MADE THE PRINCIPAL SPEECH A DENUNCIATION OF THE ABOLITIONISTS SUPPORTING THE TOPEKA MOVEMENT AND CHIEF JUSTICE LE COMTE DIGNIFIED THE OCCASION WITH APPROVING REMARKS
7729-102255-0009 ALL DISSENT ALL NON COMPLIANCE ALL HESITATION ALL MERE VIOLENCE EVEN WERE IN THEIR STRONGHOLD TOWNS LIKE LEAVENWORTH BRANDED AS ABOLITIONISM DECLARED TO BE HOSTILITY TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND PUNISHED WITH PROSCRIPTION PERSONAL VIOLENCE EXPULSION AND FREQUENTLY DEATH
7729-102255-0010 OF THE LYNCHINGS THE MOBS AND THE MURDERS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE EXCEPT IN A VERY SLENDER WORK TO NOTE THE FREQUENT AND ATROCIOUS DETAILS
7729-102255-0011 THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH UPON THE MORE SALIENT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN KANSAS WHICH HAPPILY ARE NOT SANGUINARY IF HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE ISOLATED CASES OF BLOODSHED COULD BE DESCRIBED THEY WOULD SHEW A STARTLING AGGREGATE OF BARBARITY AND A LOSS OF LIFE FOR OPINION'S SAKE
7729-102255-0012 SEVERAL HUNDRED FREE STATE MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THESE SUMMONS
7729-102255-0013 IT WAS IN FACT THE BEST WELCOME OF ITS DAY
7729-102255-0014 THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY BECAME MISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN
7729-102255-0015 ONE OF HIS MILITIA GENERALS SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR SHOULD REQUIRE THE OUTLAWS AT LAURENCE AND ELSEWHERE TO SURRENDER THE SHARP'S RIFLES ANOTHER WROTE ASKING HIM TO CALL OUT THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS AT FORT LEAVENWORTH
7729-102255-0016 THE GOVERNOR ON HIS PART BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF A LEGALITY OF EMPLOYING MISSOURI MILITIA TO ENFORCE KANSAS LAWS WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HELP OF FEDERAL TROOPS
7729-102255-0017 SHERIFF JONES HAD HIS POCKETS ALWAYS FULL OF WRITS ISSUED IN THE SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION BUT WAS OFTEN BAFFLED BY THE SHARP WITS AND READY RESOURCES OF A FREE STATE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES DEFIED OUTRIGHT
7729-102255-0018 LITTLE BY LITTLE HOWEVER THE LATTER BECAME HEMMED AND BOUND IN THE MESHES OF THE VARIOUS DEVICES AND PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS EVOLVED FROM THE BOGUS STATES
7729-102255-0019 TO EMBARRASS THIS DAMAGING EXPOSURE JUDGE LE COMTE ISSUED A WRIT AGAINST THE EX GOVERNOR ON A FRIVOLOUS CHARGE OF CONTEMPT AND
7729-102255-0020 THE INCIDENT WAS NOT VIOLENT NOR EVEN DRAMATIC NO POSSE WAS SUMMONED NO FURTHER EFFORTS MADE AND RICHARD FEARING PERSONAL VIOLENCE SOON FLED IN DISGUISE
7729-102255-0021 BUT THE AIR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE FREE STATE MEN WERE INSURRECTIONISTS AND OUTLAWS
7729-102255-0022 FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICADED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMPS AND SCOUT PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GUERRILLA BANDS HALF PARTISAN HALF PREDATOR
7729-102255-0023 THEIR DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS HOWEVER DISPLAY ONE BROAD AND UNFAILING REFERENCE
7729-102255-0024 THE THREE STATE MEN CLUNG TO THEIR PRAIRIE TOWNS AND PRAIRIE RAVINES WITH ALL THE OBSTINACY AND COURAGE OF TRUE DEFENDERS OF THEIR HOMES AND FIRESIDES
7729-102255-0025 OUR ASSUMED CHARACTER CHANGED WITH THEIR CHANGING OPPORTUNITIES OR NECESSITIES
7729-102255-0026 IN THE SHOOTING OF SHERIFF JONES IN LAWRENCE AND IN THE REFUSAL OF EX GOVERNOR READER TO ALLOW A DEPUTY MARSHAL TO ARREST HIM THEY DISCOVERED GRAVE OFFENCES AGAINST THE TERRITORIAL AND THE UNITED STATES LAWS
7729-102255-0027 FOOTNOTE SUMNER TO SHANNON MAY TWELFTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY
7729-102255-0028 PRIVATE PERSONS WHO HAD LEASED THE FREE STATE HOTEL VAINLY BESOUGHT THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES TO PRESENT THE DESTRUCTION OF HER PROPERTY
7729-102255-0029 TEN DAYS WERE CONSUMED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE SPIRIT OF THE VENGEANCE REFUSED TO YIELD
7729-102255-0030 HE SUMMONED HALF A DOZEN CITIZENS TO JOIN IN HIS POSSE WHO FOLLOWED OBEYED AND ASSISTED HIM
7729-102255-0031 HE CONTINUED HIS PRETENDED SEARCH AND TO GIVE A COLOUR TO HIS ERRAND MADE TWO ARRESTS
7729-102255-0032 THE FREE STATE HOTEL A STONE BUILDING IN DIMENSIONS FIFTY BY SEVENTY FEET THREE STOREYS HIGH AND HANDSOMELY FURNISHED PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED ONLY FOR LODGING ROOMS ON THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME OPENED ITS TABLE ACCOMMODATION TO THE PUBLIC AND PROVIDED A FREE DINNER IN HONOR OF THE OCCASION
7729-102255-0033 AS HE HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE HOTEL THE REASSURED CITIZENS BEGAN TO LAUGH IN THEIR OWN FEARS
7729-102255-0034 TO THEIR OWN SORROW THEY WERE SOON UNDECEIVED
7729-102255-0035 THE MILITARY FORCE PARTLY BABBLE PARTLY ORGANIZED HAD MEANWHILE MOVED INTO THE TOWN
7729-102255-0036 HE PLANTED A COMPANY BEFORE THE HOTEL AND DEMANDED A SURRENDER OF THE ARMS BELONGING TO HIS FREE STATE MILITARY COMPANIES
7729-102255-0037 HALF AN HOUR LATER TURNING A DEAF EAR TO ALL REMONSTRANCE HE GAVE THE PROPRIETORS UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK TO REMOVE THEIR FAMILIES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE FREE STATE HOSPITAL
7729-102255-0038 ATCHEN WHO HAD BEEN HARANGUING THE MOB PLANTED HIS TWO GUNS BEFORE THE BUILDING AND TRAINED THEM UPON IT
7729-102255-0039 THE INMATES BEING REMOVED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR A FEW CANNON BALLS WERE FIRED THROUGH THE SNOW WALLS
7729-102255-0040 IN THIS ACCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATIVE AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSETTS FINDS ITS MOST HONORABLE AND TRIUMPHANT VINDICATION
7729-102255-0041 THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOT SO TRANSPARENT THE LANGUAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISGUST TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND ACCESSORIES
7729-102255-0042 RELOCATED FOOTNOTE GOVERNOR ROBINSON BEING ON HIS WAY EAST THE STEAMBOAT ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELLING STOPPED IN LEXINGTON MISSOURI
7729-102255-0043 IN A FEW DAYS AN OFFICER CAME WITH A REQUISITION FROM GOVERNOR SHANNON AND TOOK THE PRISONER BY LAND OFF WESTPORT AND AFTERWARDS FROM THERE TO KANSAS CITY AND LEAVENWORTH
7729-102255-0044 HERE HE WAS PLACED IN THE CUSTODY OF CAPTAIN MARTIN OF THE KICKAPOO RANGERS WHO PROVED A KIND JAILER AND MATERIALLY ASSISTED IN PROTECTING HIM FROM THE DANGEROUS INTENTIONS OF THE MOB WHICH AT THAT TIME HELD LEAVENWORTH AND THE REIGN OF TERROR
7729-102255-0045 CAPTAIN MARTYN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORST COMES TO WORST
7729-102255-0046 IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINTH A COMPANY OF DRAGOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PRO SLAVERY MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIES TO LE COMPON IN THE CHARGE OF OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY
8224-274381-0000 THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTURBED ROYALISTS
8224-274381-0001 AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF MURCHESTON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY PRODUCED
8224-274381-0002 WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WAS SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED
8224-274381-0003 THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSE'S COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE AT SCOTLAND
8224-274381-0004 FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCOME WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION
8224-274381-0005 DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLEY AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN IMMEDIATELY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0006 THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO OVERCOME HIM
8224-274381-0007 BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTORS
8224-274381-0008 WITH THESE AND SOME REENFORCEMENTS OF THE ATHOL MEN AND MACDONALDS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CASTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD
8224-274381-0009 THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INMERLOCHY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM
8224-274381-0010 BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNERLOCA AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTED COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0011 HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE OCCURRED CONSPICUOUS
8224-274381-0012 MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE INSTANTLY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS
8224-274381-0013 FROM THE SAME WORK NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD RELY ON
8224-274381-0014 BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF TAKING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
8224-274381-0015 THOUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTIONED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS
8224-274381-0016 VALOR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS MAINTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN GREAT MEASURE WANTING
8224-274381-0017 HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANYTHING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOUR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINE SUCCESS
8224-274384-0000 HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILLS
8224-274384-0001 THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SENT A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOUR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
8224-274384-0002 THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE PRINCE
8224-274384-0003 OR HATH HE GIVEN US HIS GIFT
8224-274384-0004 AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE LEFT TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
8224-274384-0005 BUT ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG
8224-274384-0006 THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED OF THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
8224-274384-0007 HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOURED
8224-274384-0008 THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THEIR MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR
8224-274384-0009 A PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
8224-274384-0010 BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
8224-274384-0011 THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST THEREFORE HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS
8224-274384-0012 IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCOUR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUSLY THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY
8224-274384-0013 HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS NO PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
8230-279154-0000 THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IT THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
8230-279154-0001 WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS ON THEIR USUAL CORRELETS ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
8230-279154-0002 WHETHER OR NO THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
8230-279154-0003 AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY DESIRABLE
8230-279154-0004 THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT REMEMBERS A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST
8230-279154-0005 ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE OUR LOGICAL TUNABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
8230-279154-0006 THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN HAVING THE RECORD
8230-279154-0007 HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIORIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE CAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
8230-279154-0008 BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE ARE WARRANTED
8230-279154-0009 OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGES
8230-279154-0010 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUES WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
8230-279154-0011 SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL CHANGED
8230-279154-0012 FAMILIARITY IS A FEELING CAPABLE OF GREAT DEGREES
8230-279154-0013 IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME THOUGHTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS
8230-279154-0014 I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0015 THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS MINUTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0016 IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCURS IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
8230-279154-0017 THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF A PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED
8230-279154-0018 THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME TO ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0019 IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING AND REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0020 IF WE HAD RETAINED THE KNOWLEDGE OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
8230-279154-0021 REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCES IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
8230-279154-0022 SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXT AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
8230-279154-0023 IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS MORE VAGUE
8230-279154-0024 THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE ARE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0025 WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPLANATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMEDIECY
8230-279154-0026 THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT INTO PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
8230-279154-0027 AND GRAMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
8230-279154-0028 I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS THAT I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
8230-279154-0029 THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DID NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
8230-279154-0030 SYMONDS TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY AND
8230-279154-0031 THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DID NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
8230-279154-0032 IT IS THE THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
8230-279154-0033 IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT THIS TIME
8230-279154-0034 WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE ADJUSTMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
8230-279154-0035 THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE REST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
8230-279154-0036 A FURTHER STAGE IS THAT RECOGNITION
8230-279154-0037 RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNISE IN THE CAT OF THAT MOMENT
8230-279154-0038 WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNISE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN HIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
8230-279154-0039 THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH ON ANOTHER IT IS NOT
8230-279154-0040 THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THEM BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
8230-279154-0041 THE DEFINITION OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
8230-279154-0042 THUS IF I RECOGNISE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THIS WORLD
8230-279154-0043 OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVELS OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION
8455-210777-0000 I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE WE LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT
8455-210777-0001 HAD EVA CROSWELLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINGTON OVAL REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BUNNETT AND THE BARKEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND
8455-210777-0002 ON ARRIVING AT HOME AT MY NEW RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT OUR SALON WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY
8455-210777-0003 AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY HIS MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
8455-210777-0004 I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS PRESENT QUARTER OF THE WORLD
8455-210777-0005 WE HAVE OUR LITTLE STRUGGLES HERE AS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY EYES WATER
8455-210777-0006 WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN BATTLE OX SAID MY WIFE
8455-210777-0007 QUITE SATISFIED WITH EVA
8455-210777-0008 THE LADIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HEART WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC ARE ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORD HAS TO BE MANAGED ARE ON THE OTHER
8455-210777-0009 NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE KING WILL FOLLOW
8455-210777-0010 IN THEIR MASTERS SAID MISSUS NEVERBEND
8455-210777-0011 I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN MATTERLAX TO TOUCH ON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
8455-210777-0012 MISSUS NEVERBEND AND YOU MUST INDEED BE PROUD OF YOUR SON
8455-210777-0013 JACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVA AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE WITH HIS PRAISES
8455-210777-0014 LORD KENNINGTON OVAL IS A VERY FINE PLAYER SAID MY WIFE
8455-210777-0015 I AND MY WIFE AND SON IN THE TWO CRESWELLERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINE ON BOARD THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
8455-210777-0016 THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVORED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH SINGULAR HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BEFIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
8455-210777-0017 MY WIFE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMEN A GOOD DINNER
8455-210777-0018 THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I DID NOT AGREE WITH YOU
8455-210777-0019 THIS THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
8455-210777-0020 OH YES SAID DICK AND I'M NOWHERE
8455-210777-0021 BUT I MEAN TO HAVE ONE INNINGS BEFORE LONG
8455-210777-0022 OF WHAT MISSUS NEVERBEND HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND DISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JELLIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROUGH SUCCESS
8455-210777-0023 WE SAT WITH THE HORSES SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT ASHORE
8455-210777-0024 HOW MUCH OF EVIL A REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAD THAT NOT OCCURRED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
8455-210777-0025 WHAT COULD I DO NO BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND DIE
8455-210777-0026 AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DREAMT COULD NOT ARISE
8455-210777-0027 WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSSESSED AT THE FURTHEST SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IN SECLUSION SHOULD I END MY DAYS
8455-210777-0028 JACK WOULD COME EVA'S HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMIDST THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
8455-210777-0029 IN THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP
8455-210777-0030 MISTER NEVERBEND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRIVATE IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
8455-210777-0031 YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT COURTESY AND HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR COUNTRY IN ENGLAND STANDS SO HIGH
8455-210777-0032 IT IS A JOURNEY SAID I
8455-210777-0033 BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN PRODUCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT
8455-210777-0034 NOT A DOUBT BUT HAD YOUR VOICE BEEN ONLY DOUBLE OR TROUBLE OUR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT MY DUTY TO STRUGGLE WITH YOU
8455-210777-0035 THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVERBEND SAID SIR FERDINAND O'RE BROWN
8455-210777-0036 I CAN AFFORD TO SMILE BECAUSE I AM ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS BEFORE YOU BUT I DO NOT THE LESS FEEL THAT IN A MATTER OF WHICH THE PROCESS OF THE WORLD IS CONCERNED I OR RATHER WE HAVE BEEN PUT DOWN BY BRUTE FORCE
8455-210777-0037 BUT YOU HAVE COME TO US THREATENING US WITH ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION
8455-210777-0038 HOWEVER I FEEL MYSELF QUITE ABLE AS PRESIDENT OF THIS REPUBLIC TO RECEIVE YOU WITH A COURTESY DUE TO THE SERVANTS OF A FRIENDLY ALLY
8455-210777-0039 I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE TIGGER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BOARD
8455-210777-0040 THEN SAID SIR FERDINANDO THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT WE MIGHT TAKE YOU WITH HIM
8455-210777-0041 THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET THOUGHT
8455-210777-0042 YOU HEAR WHAT SIR FERDINAND O'BURNE HAS SAID REPLIED CAPTAIN BATTLE AXE
8455-210777-0043 AND WHAT IS THE DELICATE MISSION I ASKED
8455-210777-0044 I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR SOMEWHERE OR DROWNED UPON THE VOYAGE IT MATTERED NOT WHICH
8455-210777-0045 THEN THE REPUBLIC OF BRITANNULA WAS TO BE DECLARED AS NON EXISTENT AND THE BRITISH FLAG WAS TO BE EXALTED AND A BRITISH GOVERNOR INSTALLED ON THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
8455-210777-0046 YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE IT'S THERE SAID CAPTAIN BATTLE X AND THAT I CAN SO USE IT AS TO HALF OBLITERATE YOUR TOWN WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF MY RETURN ON BOARD
8455-210777-0047 YOU PROPOSES TO KIDNAP ME I SAID
8455-210777-0048 WHAT WOULD HAVE BECOME OF YOUR GUN WERE I TO KIDNAP YOU
8455-210777-0049 LIEUTENANT CROSSTRET IS A VERY GALLANT OFFICER
8455-210777-0050 ONE OF US ALWAYS REMAINS ON BOARD WHILE THE ANOTHER IS ON SHORE
8455-210777-0051 WHAT WORLDWIDE INIQUITY SUCH A SPEECH AS THAT DISCLOSES SAID I STILL TURNING MYSELF TO THE CAPTAIN FOR THOUGH I WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THEM BOTH BY MY WORDS HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE MY DISLIKE CENTERED ITSELF ON SIR FERDINANDO
8455-210777-0052 YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO SUGGEST SAID HE THAT THAT IS A MATTER OF OPINION
8455-210777-0053 WERE I TO COMPLY WITH YOUR ORDERS WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY OWN OPINION I SHOULD NOT SEEM TO HAVE DONE SO WILLINGLY HEREAFTER
8455-210777-0054 IN THE LETTER RAN AS FOLLOWS
8455-210777-0055 SO I HAVE IT IN COMMAND TO INFORM YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF THE CROWN COLONY WHICH IS CALLED BRITANNULA
8455-210777-0056 THESE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COLONY ARE WITHIN YOUR EXCELLENCY'S KNOWLEDGE
8455-210777-0057 BUT IN THEIR SELECTION OF A CONSTITUTION THE BRITON ULISTS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY ALLOWED THEMSELVES BUT ONE DELIBERATE ASSEMBLY AND HENCE HAVE SPRUNG THEIR PRESENT DIFFICULTIES
8455-210777-0058 IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVE THAT PERIOD OF LIFE WITH WHICH MEN CEASE TO WORK
8455-210777-0059 BUT IT IS SURMISED THAT YOU WILL FIND DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF YOUR ENTERING AT ONCE INTO YOUR GOVERNOR
8455-210777-0060 THE TOM BRIGHT IS ARMED WITH A WEAPON OF GREAT POWER AGAINST WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRITANNULA SHOULD PREVAIL
8455-210777-0061 YOU WILL CARRY OUT WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED MEN OF THE NORTH NORTHWEST BIRMINGHAM REGIMENT WHICH WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE FOR YOUR OWN SECURITY AS IT IS THOUGHT THAT IF MISTER NEVERBEND BE WITHDRAWN THE PEOPLE WOULD REVERT EASILY TO THEIR OLD HABITS OF OBEDIENCE
8455-210777-0062 WHEN DO YOU INTEND THAT THE PRINCE BRIGHT SHALL START
8455-210777-0063 AND TO DAY I SHOUTED
8455-210777-0064 AND THEN I HAVE NO ONE READY TO WHOM I CAN GIVE UP THE ARCHIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT
8455-210777-0065 I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEM SAID SIR FERDINAND SO
8455-210777-0066 THEY OF COURSE MUST ALL BE AUTERS
8455-210777-0067 OR OF THE HABITS OF OUR PEOPLE HE IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
8455-210777-0068 THEIR POWER IS SUFFICIENT I SAID
8455-210777-0069 IF YOU WILL GIVE US YOUR PROMISE TO MEET CAPTAIN ADOLAX HERE AT THIS TIME TO MORROW WE WILL STRETCH A POINT AND DELAY THE DEPARTURE OF THE JOHN BRIGHT FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
8455-210777-0070 AND THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED TOO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM ME A PROMISE THAT I WOULD DEPART AT PEACE
8463-287645-0000 THIS WAS WHAT DID THE MISCHIEF SO FAR AS THE RING AWAY WAS CONCERNED
8463-287645-0001 IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO KNOW MORE OF THEM HERE
8463-287645-0002 FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD EXPRESSED HIMSELF WITH REGARD TO ROBERT HOLLAND NO MAN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF HIS RECOLLECTIONS WILL BE LONGER REMEMBERED THAN HE HIS ENTHRALLMENT WHILE UNDER HOLLAND WILL HARDLY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
8463-287645-0003 OF THIS PARTY EDWARD A BOY OF SEVENTEEN CALLED FORTH MUCH SYMPATHY HE TOO WAS CLAIMED BY HALLAN
8463-287645-0004 JOHN WELLESLEY COMBASH BISHOP TAYLOR AND THOMAS EDWARD SKINNER
8463-287645-0005 A FEW YEARS BACK ONE OF THEIR SERVANTS A COACHMAN WAS KEPT ON THE COACH BOX ONE COLD NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE OUT AT A BALL UNTIL HE BECAME ALMOST FROZEN TO DEATH IN FACT HE DID DIE IN THE INFIRMARY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE FROST ABOUT ONE WEEK AFTERWARDS
8463-287645-0006 THE DOCTOR WHO ATTENDED THE INJURED CREATURE IN THIS CASE WAS SIMPLY TOLD THAT HE SLIPPED AND FELL DOWN THE STAIRS AS SHE WAS COMING DOWN
8463-287645-0007 ANOTHER CASE SAID YOUNG WELLESLEY WAS A LITTLE GIRL HALF GROWN WHO WAS WASHING WINDOWS UP STAIRS ONE DAY AND UNLUCKILY FELL ASLEEP IN THE WINDOW AND IN THIS POSITION WAS FOUND BY HER MISTRESS IN A RAGE THE MISTRESS HIT HER A HEAVY SLAP KNOCKED HER OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SHE FELL TO THE PAVEMENT AND DIED IN A FEW HOURS FROM THE EFFECTS THEREOF
8463-287645-0008 AS USUAL NOTHING WAS DONE IN THE WAY OF ORNAMENT
8463-287645-0009 I NEVER KNEW OF BUT ONE MAN WHO COULD EVER PERCEIVE HIM
8463-287645-0010 HE WORKED ME VERY HARD AS HE WANTED TO BE BEATING ME ALL THE TIME
8463-287645-0011 SHE WAS A LARGE HOMELY WOMAN THEY WERE COMMON WHITE PEOPLE WITH NO REPUTATION IN HER COMMUNITY
8463-287645-0012 SUBSTANTIALLY THIS WAS JACOB'S UNTARNISHED DESCRIPTION OF HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS
8463-287645-0013 AS TO HIS AGE AND ALSO THE NAME OF HIS MASTER JACOB'S STATEMENT VARIED SOMEWHAT FROM A ADVERTISEMENT
8463-287645-0014 OF STARTING I DIDN'T KNOW MY WAY TO COME
8463-294825-0000 BUT IT'S ALMOST BEYOND CONJECTURE
8463-294825-0001 THIS REALITY BEGINS TO EXPLAIN THE DARK POWER AND OLD WORLDLY FASCINATION OF TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS
8463-294825-0002 FIRST AS A PARIS STOCKBROKER LATER AS A CELEBRATED AUTHOR AND YACHTSMAN HE WENT ON FREQUENT VOYAGES TO BRITAIN AFRICA THE MEDITERRANEAN
8463-294825-0003 NEM BUILDS A FABULOUS FUTURISTIC SUBMARINE THE NAUTILUS THEN CONDUCTS AN UNDERWATER CAMPAIGN OF VENGEANCE AGAINST HIS IMPERIALIST OPPRESSOR
8463-294825-0004 IN ALL THE NOVEL HAD A DIFFICULT GESTANCY
8463-294825-0005 OTHER SUBTLETIES OCCURS INSIDE EACH EPISODE THE TEXTURES SPARKLING WITH WIT INFORMATION AND INSIGHT
8463-294825-0006 HIS SPECIFICATIONS FOR AN OPEN SEA SUBMARINE AND A SELF CONTAINING DIVING SUIT WERE DECADES BEFORE THEIR TIME AND YET MODERN TECHNOLOGY BEARS THEM OUT TRIUMPHANTLY
8463-294825-0007 EVEN THE SUPPORTING CASTE IS SHREWDLY DRAWN PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CAREER SCIENTIST CAUGHT IN AN ETHICAL CONFLICT CONSEIL THE COMPULSIVE CLASSIFIER WHO SUPPLIES HUMOROUS TAG LINES FOR VERNE'S FIRST FACTS THE HARPOONER NED LAND A CREATURE OF CONSTANT APPETITES MAN AS HEROIC ANIMAL
8463-294825-0008 BUT MOST OF THE NOVEL'S BROODING POWER COMES FROM CAPTAIN NEMO
8463-294825-0009 THIS COMPULSION LEADS NEWELL INTO UGLY CONTRADICTIONS HE IS A FIGHTER FOR FREEDOM YET ALL WHO BOARD HIS SHIP ARE IMPRISONED THERE FOR GOOD HE WORKS TO SAVE LIVES BOTH HUMAN AND ANIMAL YET HE HIMSELF CREATES A HOLOCAUST HE DETESTS IMPERIALISM YET HE LAYS PERSONAL CLAIM TO THE SOUTH POLE
8463-294825-0010 AND IN THIS LAST ACTION HE FALLS UPON THE CLASSIC SIN OF PRIDE
8463-294825-0011 HE IS SWIFTLY PUNISH'D
8463-294825-0012 THE NAUTILUS NEARLY PERISHES IN THE ANTARCTICS AND NEMO SINKS INTO A GROWING DEPRESSION
8463-294825-0013 FOR MANY THEN THIS BOOK HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF FASCINATION SURELY ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL NOVELS EVER WRITTEN AN INSPIRATION FOR SUCH SCIENTISTS AND DISCOVERERS AS ENGINEER SIMON LAKE OCEANOGRAPHER WM B B POLAR TRAVELER SIR ERNEST SHACKELTON
8463-294825-0014 FATHOM SIX FEET TWO

8463-294828-0000 AND CHAPTER THREE AS MASTER WISHES
8463-294828-0001 THREE EVENINGS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J B HOBSON'S LETTER I NO MORE DREAMED OF CHASING THE UNICORN THAN OF TRYING FOR THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE
8463-294828-0002 EVEN SO I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY EXHAUSTED AND BADLY NEEDING TO REST
8463-294828-0003 I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE MY COUNTRY AGAIN MY FRIENDS MY DOMESTIC QUARTERS BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS MY DEARLY BELOVED COLLECTIONS
8463-294828-0004 AS NOW NOTHING COULD HOLD ME BACK
8463-294828-0005 AND CONSEIL WAS MY MANSERVANT
8463-294828-0006 FROM RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SCIENTISTS IN OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE BY THE BOTANICAL GROUNDS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWO
8463-294828-0007 CLASSIFYING WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM SO HE KNEW NOTHING ELSE WELL VERSED IN THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION HE WAS POORLY VERSED IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A SPERM WHALE FROM A BALE AND WHALE
8463-294828-0008 AND THINK WHAT A FINE GALLANT LAD
8463-294828-0009 NOT ONCE DID HE COMMENT ON THAT LENGTH OR THE HARDSHIPS OF THE JOURNEY
8463-294828-0010 NEVER DID HE OBJECT TO BUCKLING UP HIS SUIT CASE FOR ANY COUNTRY WHATEVER CHINA OR THE CONCO NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF IT WAS
8463-294828-0011 HE WENT HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE EVERYWHERE IN PERFECT CONTENTMENT
8463-294828-0012 PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THIS UNDERHANDED WAY OF ADMITTING THAT I HAD TALKED FORTY
8463-294828-0013 HE WAS A FANATIC ON FORMALITY AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE THEY GOT TIRESOME
8463-294828-0014 THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO STOP AND THINK EVEN FOR THE WORLD'S MOST EMOTIONALLY MAN
8463-294828-0015 I CONSEIL I CALLED A THIRD TIME CONSEIL APPEARED
8463-294828-0016 DID MASTER SUMMON ME HE SAID ENTER
8463-294828-0017 PACK UP AS MUCH INTO MY TRUNK AS YOU CAN MY TRAVELLING KIT MY SUITS SHIRTS AND SOCKS DON'T BOTHER COUNTING JUST SQUEEZE IT ALL IN AND HURRY
8463-294828-0018 WE'LL DEAL WITH THEM LATER MUCH
8463-294828-0019 ANYHOW WE'LL LEAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO SHIP THE WHOLE MENAGERIES TO FRANCE
8463-294828-0020 HERE WE ARE CERTAINLY I REPLIED EVASIVELY BUT AFTER WE MAKE A DETOUR
8463-294828-0021 A ROUT SLIGHTLY LESS DIRECT THAT'S ALL
8463-294828-0022 WE'RE LEAVING ON THE ABRAHAM
8463-294828-0023 YOU SEE MY FRIEND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE MONSTERS THE NOTORIOUS NARWHALE
8463-294828-0024 WE DON'T KNOW WHENCE IT WILL TAKE US
8463-294828-0025 OH WE'RE GOING JUST THE SAME
8463-294828-0026 WE HAVE A COMMANDER WHO'S GAME AT ANYTHING
8463-294828-0027 I LEFT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING MY CONTAINERS OF STUFFED ANIMALS AND DRIED PLANTS TO PARISIANS
8463-294828-0028 I OPENED A LINE OF CREDIT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE BARPAROUSA AND CONSEIL AT MY HEELS I JUMPED INTO A CARRIAGE
8463-294828-0029 OUR BAGGAGE WAS IMMEDIATELY CARRIED TO THE DECK OF THE FRIGATE I RUSHED A BOARD
8463-294828-0030 I ASKED FOR COMMANDERS FARRAGUT
8463-294828-0031 ONE OF THE SAILORS LED ME TO THE AFTERDECK WHERE I STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF A SMART LOOKING OFFICER WHO EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS ME
8463-294828-0032 IN PERSON WILLIAM ABOARD PROFESSOR YOUR CABIN IS WAITING FOR YOU
8463-294828-0033 I WERE WELL SATISFIED WITH MY CABIN WHICH WAS LOCATED IN THE STERN AND OPENED INTO THE OFFICERS MESS
8463-294828-0034 OH WE'LL BE QUITE COMFORTABLE HERE I TOLD CONSEIL
8463-294828-0035 AND SO IF I HAD BEEN DELAYED BY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR EVEN LESS THE FRIGATE WOULD HAVE GONE WITHOUT ME AND I WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON HIS UNEARTHLY EXTRAORDINARY AND INCONCEIVABLE EXPEDITION WHOSE TRUE STORY MIGHT WELL MEET WITH SOME SKEPTICISM
8463-294828-0036 THE WHARVES OF BROOKLYN AND EVERY PART OF NEW YORK BORDERING THE PEACE RIVER WERE CROWDED WITH CURIOSITY SEEKERS
8463-294828-0037 DEPARTING FROM FIVE HUNDRED A THOUSAND THROATS THREE CHEERS BURST FORTH IN SUCCESSION
8463-294828-0038 THOUSANDS OF HANDKERCHIEFS WERE WAVING ABOVE THESE TIGHTLY PACKED MASSES HAILING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN UNTIL THEY REACHED THE WATERS OF THE HUDSON RIVER AT THE TIP OF THE LONG PENINSULA THAT FORMS NEW YORK CITY
8555-284447-0000 THEN HE RUSHED DOWN STAIRS INTO THE COURTYARD SHOUTING LOUDLY FOR HIS SOLDIERS AND THREATENING TO PATCH EVERYBODY IN HIS DOMINIONS IF THE SAILORMEN WAS NOT RECAPTURED
8555-284447-0001 HOLD HIM FAST MY MEN AND AS SOON AS I'VE HAD MY COFFEE AND OATMEAL I'LL TAKE HIM TO THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE AND PATCH EM
8555-284447-0002 I WOULDN'T MIND A CUP OF COFFEE MYSELF SAID CAP'N BILL I'VE HAD CONSIDERABLE EXERCISE THIS MORNIN AN I'M READY FOR BREAKFAST
8555-284447-0003 BUT CAP'N BILL MADE NO SUCH ATTEMPT KNOWING IT WOULD BE USELESS TO
8555-284447-0004 AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM OF THE GREAT COUNCIL THE BOOLOOROO GAVE A YELL OF DISAPPOINTMENT
8555-284447-0005 THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE WAS HIGH AND BIG AND OVER IT RAN ROWS OF BENCHES FOR THE SPECTATORS TO SIT UPON
8555-284447-0006 IN ONE PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM WAS A RAISED PLATFORM FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY WITH ELEGANT THRONE CHAIRS FOR THE KING AND QUEEN AND SIX SMALLER BUT RICHLY UPHOLSTERED CHAIRS FOR THE SNUB NOSED PRINCES
8555-284447-0007 THEREFORE HER MAJESTY PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANY ONE BUT NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER
8555-284447-0008 RICH JEWELS OR BLUE STONES GLITTERED UPON THEIR PERSONS AND THE ROYAL LADIES WERE FULLY AS GORGEOUS AS THEY WERE HAUGHTY AND OVERBEARING
8555-284447-0009 MORNING GIRLS HELP YOU FEEL AS WELL AS YOU LOOK
8555-284447-0010 CONTROL YOURSELVES MY DEARS REPLIED THE BOOLOOROO THE WORST PUNISHMENT I KNOW HOW TO INFLICT ON ANY ONE THIS STRANGER IS ABOUT TO SUFFER YOU WILL SEE A VERY PRETTY PATCHING MY ROYAL DAUGHTERS
8555-284447-0011 SUPPOSE IT'S A BIRD
8555-284447-0012 THE CAPTAIN SHAKE HIS HEAD
8555-284447-0013 WHY YOU SAID TO FETCH THE FIRST LIVING CREETUR WE MET AN THAT WAS THE SPILLY GOAT REPLIED THE CAPTAIN PANTING HARD AS HE HELD FAST TO ONE OF THE GOATS HORNS
8555-284447-0014 THE IDEA OF FETCHING CAP'N BILL TO A BOAT WAS VASTLY AMUSING TO HIM AND THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE HE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER
8555-284447-0015 THEY LOOKED SOMETHING ALIKE YOU KNOW SUGGESTED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER DOUBTFULLY AND THEY'RE NEARLY THE SAME SIZE IF YOU STAND THE GOAT ON HIS HIND LEGS THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME STYLE OF WHISKERS AND THEY'RE BOTH OF THEM OBSTINATE AND DANGEROUS SO THEY OUGHT TO MAKE A GOOD PATCH SPLENDID
8555-284447-0016 THE FINE GLORIOUS
8555-284447-0017 WHEN THIS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE BOOLOOROO LEANED OVER TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHY THE FRAME RUSHED AWAY SEEMINGLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND HE WAS THE MORE PUZZLED BECAUSE IT HAD NEVER DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE
8555-284447-0018 AT ONCE THE GOAT GAVE A LEAP ESCAPED FROM THE SOLDIERS AND WITH BOWED HEAD RUSHED UPON A BOOLOOROO
8555-284447-0019 BEFORE ANY COULD STOP HIM HE BUTTED HIS MAJESTY SO FIERCELY THAT THE KING SOARED FAR INTO THE AIR AND TUMBLED IN A HEAP AMONG THE BENCHES WHERE HE LAY MOANING AND GROANING
8555-284447-0020 THAT GOAT'S WARLIKE SPIRIT WAS ROUSED BY THIS SUCCESSFUL ATTACK
8555-284447-0021 THEN THEY SPED IN GREAT HASTE FOR THE DOOR AND THE GOAT GAVE A FINAL BUTT THAT SENT THE ROW OF ROYAL LADIES ALL DIVING IN THE CORRIDOR IN ANOTHER TANGLE WHEREUPON THEY SHRIEKED IN A MANNER THAT TERRIFIED EVERY ONE WITHIN SOUND OF THEIR VOICES
8555-284447-0022 I HAD A NOTION IT WAS YOU PAID TO SAVE ME FROM THE KNIFE
8555-284447-0023 I COULDN'T SHIVER MUCH BEING BOUND SO TIGHT BUT WHEN I'M LOOSE I MEAN TO HAVE JUST A GOOD SHIVER TO RELIEVE MY FEELIN'S
8555-284447-0024 COME AND GET THE BOOLOOROO SHE SAID GOING TOWARD THE BOXES
8555-284449-0000 SO THEY WERE QUITE WILLING TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF THEIR GIRL QUEEN AND IN A SHORT TIME THE BLAST OF TRUMPETS AND ROLL OF DRUMS AND CLASHING OF CYMBALS TOLD TROT AND CAP'N BILL THAT THE BLUE BANS HAD ASSEMBLED BEFORE THE PALACE
8555-284449-0001 THEN THEY ALL MARCHED OUT A LITTLE WAY IN THE FIELDS AND FOUND THAT THE ARMY OF PINKIES HAD ALREADY FORMED AND WAS ADVANCING STEADILY TOWARD THEM
8555-284449-0002 AT THE HEAD OF THE PINKIES WERE GHIP GHISIZZLE AND BUTTON BRIGHT WHO HAD THE PARROT ON HIS SHOULDER AND THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY CAPTAIN CORALLEY AND CAPTAIN TINTANT AND ROSALIE THE WITCH
8555-284449-0003 WHEN THE BLUESKINS SAW GHIP GHISIZZLE THEY RAISED ANOTHER GREAT SHOUT FOR HE WAS THE FAVORITE OF THEIR SOLDIERS AND VERY POPULAR WITH ALL THE PEOPLE
8555-284449-0004 SINCE LAST THURSDAY I GHIP GHISIZZLE HAVE BEEN THE LAWFUL BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUE COUNTRY BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE CONQUERED BY QUEEN TROT I SUPPOSE I AM CONQUERED TOO AND YOU ARE NO BOOLOOROO AT ALL
8555-284449-0005 WHEN HE FINISHED SHE SAID TEARFULLY
8555-284449-0006 DON'T WORRY GIZZLE DEAR IT'LL ALL COME RIGHT PRETTY SOON
8555-284449-0007 NOW THEN LET'S ENTER THE CITY AND ENJOY THE GREAT FEAST THAT'S BEING COOKED I'M NEARLY STARVED MYSELF FOR THIS CONQUERIN KINGDOM'S IS HARD WORK
8555-284449-0008 THEN SHE GAVE ROSALIE BACK HER MAGIC WINGS THANKING THE KIND WITCH FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR THEM
8555-284449-0009 YOU ARE MATE REPLIED THE SAILORS
8555-284449-0010 BUT IT WILL BE SUCH A SATISFACTION
8555-284449-0011 THE GUARDS HAD A TERRIBLE STRUGGLE WITH THE GOAT WHICH WAS LOOSE IN THE ROOM AND STILL WANTED TO FIGHT BUT FINALLY THEY SUBDUED THE ANIMAL AND THEN THEY TOOK THE BOOLOOROO OUT OF THE FRAME HE WAS TIED IN AND BROUGHT BOTH HIM AND THE GOAT BEFORE KING TROT WHO AWAITED THEM IN THE THRONE ROOM OF THE PALACE
8555-284449-0012 I'LL GLADLY DO THAT PROMISED THE NEW BOOLOOROO AND I'LL FEED THE HONBLE GOAT ALL THE SHAVINGS AND LEATHER AND TIN CANS HE CAN EAT BESIDES THE GRASS
8555-284449-0013 EXCUSE ME SAID TROT I NEGLECTED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT THE BOOLOOROO ANY WAY
8555-284449-0014 THE FORMER BOOLOOROO CROWNED
8555-284449-0015 I'LL NOT BE WICKED ANY MORE SIGHED THAT OLD BOOLOOROO I'LL REFORM
8555-284449-0016 AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN I SHALL BE A MODEL OF DEPORTMENT AS IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO BE OTHERWISE
8555-284449-0017 WHEN FIRST THEY ENTERED THE THRONE ROOM THEY TRIED TO BE AS HAUGHTY AND SCORNFUL AS EVER BUT THE BULLS WHO WERE ASSEMBLED THERE ALL LAUGHED AT THEM AND JEERED THEM FOR THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN ALL THE BLUE COUNTRY WHO LOVED THE PRINCESSES THE LEAST LITTLE BIT
8555-284449-0018 SO GHIP GHISIZZLE ORDERED THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE A FILE OF SOLDIERS AND ESCORT THE RAVING BEAUTIES TO HIS NEW HOME
8555-284449-0019 THAT EVENING TROT GAVE A GRAND BALL IN THE PALACE TO WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE PINKIE AND THE BLUESKINS WERE INVITED
8555-284449-0020 THE COMBINED BANDS OF BOTH COUNTRIES PLAYED THE MUSIC AND A FINE SUPPER WERE SERVED
8555-292519-0000 BRIGHTER THAN EARLY DAWN'S MOST BRILLIANT DYE IS BLOWN CLEAR BANDS OF COLOR THROUGH THE SKY THAT SWIRL AND SWEEP AND MEET TO BREAK AND FOAM LIKE RAINBOW VEILS UPON A BUBBLE'S DOME
