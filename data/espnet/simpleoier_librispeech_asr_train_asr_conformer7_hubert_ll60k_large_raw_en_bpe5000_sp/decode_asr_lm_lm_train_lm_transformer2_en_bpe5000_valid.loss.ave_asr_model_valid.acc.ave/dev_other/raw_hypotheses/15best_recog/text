116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED A CITY I HEARD THE BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN HIS NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS THE STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SILENT INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FAITHFUL GUIDE
116-288045-0005 YES HE SAID I CONDUCT THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AN IDOL I WISHED TAKEN BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPPED GODS WHO DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAMORED IN MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 YES I SAID IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDOL THEN AND NOT A DOG
116-288045-0011 IT MADE ATHENS A CITY OF LIGHT IT CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELATION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 THEY HAD ONLY ONE FAULT INTERRUPTED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANSWER WOULD BE IT WAS NOT SURE
116-288045-0014 PROTESTING HIM
116-288045-0015 I WHISPERED TO MYSELF WHICH BLASPHEMY
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNING THE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 I DO YOU DOUBT HOMER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOMER OF THE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLLO IS BUT AN IDOL
116-288045-0020 HE HAS A GOD AND THE SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN GLORIOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE THE VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT THE PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTHDAY OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL SAVIOR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH A SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICES
116-288045-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON SHE WAS ONLY AN IDOL
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WAS TO SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWERING TO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JESUS AND HASTEN TURNING TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 WILL IT NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO THEIR WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HANDS TO CLASS HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILLING WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT AND I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF AN IDOL AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH AN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 FOR I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 AND THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CANDIED DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN A MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY GIVE FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN ANY THING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 AND IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 O HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE DOES NOT BUILD UP IS ANOTHER CRITICISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OR PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTED
116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTHS IN A JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF THE STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRINNUL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RITES POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WERE CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WISH YOU WOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 BUT FIRST LET US BE IMPERSONAL THE EPITHETS IRREVERENT BLASPHEMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL IS FLUNG AT A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM ENVY
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE LETTING THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST ANIMATED BY THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BY CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 A MYTH IS A FANCIFUL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHAENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MIND CRAVES FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN INBORN DESIRE TO SEE
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY BECAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS METHOS THE PRIMITIVE MAN WAS SATISFIED UNTIL HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALISED ITS INADEQUACY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALISATION
116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE SIDED PEOPLE LIVING IN INDIA HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE HINDUS
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MYTHES HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JUST A MYTH
116-288047-0007 THERE IS IN MAN A FACULTY OR FICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS THAN IT POSSESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BIT INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURBING ITS PACE AND SUBDUING THE RELENTLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FILL THAT SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE AND AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 WE COVET THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET DO NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH THEIR FIRM GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SIMON WAS NOT BORN UNTIL MAN HAD MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROWN UP PEOPLE WILL CREATE SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FAITH O MANKIND
116-288047-0016 ITS SCHOOL IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SCIENCE OF THE SOUL
116-288047-0018 IN THIS DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTHPIECES AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY THAT MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TO BE REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE VENGEANCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABORING HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DATES WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES AS THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPELS GIVE NO DATE BUT APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET HERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 WHY IS DISCREPANCY IN THE HISTORICAL STATEMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS LED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE TURN TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS ABOUT JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 AND IT IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON LOVES THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN AND THE ZODIAC AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN AUSTRALLIA HAS BECOME THE CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE OR INGEN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SCEPTICAL CELSUS ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISSS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEARED TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYSTICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW WHO WAS
116-288048-0012 THERE WERE JOHN PETER JUDAS AND MARY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXIST
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF THEM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE FIND THE PRESENCE OF A MYTH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEN
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE MOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF THIS TIME DID NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 SHOULD THEY HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 HOW ELSE IS THIS UNANIMOUS SENTIMENT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THOSE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BY THAT SWORD NOW AND BY HELL FIRE HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JUDAS MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY THE MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO BE NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE ANY PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF DELUDED HOPES THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO MAY NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH THE PREACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARRIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISIONS THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YE ASKED ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID THEY NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE MISERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DID NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR METEIA OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAVES
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL BUT IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS DEPRESSING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED BY A BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCUSSABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHIPS WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONLY
1255-138279-0008 NO THREE
1255-138279-0009 FOUR SIX
1255-138279-0010 WITH EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE STOCK STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDDLE LAND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL
1255-138279-0014 THE WHEEL WAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 SUDDENLY A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUS
1255-138279-0017 I ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW TO FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 AND I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 NOW MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 I HAVE DONE
1255-138279-0021 AS WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF HE SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I I FORGOT TO ASK
1255-138279-0024 GOOD MORNING FRANK GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 THOSE ARRANGE THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE CONTEST NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH WAS RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 SO THE GIRL BEGGED FOR SOME DELAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE DISCOVERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS KEEN AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WOULD PUT UP THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LOVELL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR HIM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THEY' ARE POLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY MY GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THERE MASTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MY WATER BOIL MISTER THWAITE SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THIS CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES COULD BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL KNOW HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AN A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN LASS ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAD A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I'D SOONER SEE YOU DARN MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEETHEARS
1255-74899-0021 WE CAN DO THAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AN NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT ON SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NO
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE INQUIRE
1255-90407-0003 I NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH DO YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 WE SHOULD THINK SO
1255-90407-0006 HE'S MY FRIEND INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE NO TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER'S IS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BYE
1255-90407-0009 BUT YOU COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU HEARD SIR
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS APPEARANCE
1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME OF MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 WAS THE THIS EVENING
1255-90407-0014 THERE ON THE NETS THEY LAY
1255-90407-0015 JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULET'S
1255-90407-0016 NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUNMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE HE WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND HAS AN ISLAND STILL
1255-90407-0019 I HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE STEADIED HER GENTLY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHILE THEY WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD BY THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE GLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO TAKE THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF HE SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH THE DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PEARSTONE
1255-90407-0028 SHE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARERS OF THIS ATTIRE
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVIS CARRO
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES I
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS MINAVAN'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WAS NOT
1255-90413-0004 BUT WAS YOU ABLE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH OTHERWISE SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO DRAW IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM HER LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POOL SEEMED COLD THOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD WARE HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN WE WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BEST EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FELT LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WAS AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UNCIVILLY
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY UP AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANELLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSCELYN PIARSTONE
1255-90413-0019 OH DIDN'T HE MARRY
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINEWAN WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 FOR JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY ARRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMP LIGHT NICOLA PINE AVEN
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD SEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED IN A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM AND AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 TO SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JOSCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF THE LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POSTS IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THEIR EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAYS OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST OR PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APAREGIS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVEALED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING A HIGHER GOOD AND IT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LADDERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVETICISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS OF ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN RIGHTENING FAST
1585-131718-0007 YES THE VERY VOGUAL OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LINEING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR THE STREET LINING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDING FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCES WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMAL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES AND THEIR LEADING CITIES
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONGLY OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THIS MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCOLDE BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN IS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ANIMALS
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HUNDREDS OF CITIZENS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST WAS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THEY WERE PLENTY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MIGHT BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE JANIE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM IN THE BALASTON WATTAGE
1585-131718-0023 WAS SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN YOU STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I HAD A CLUE HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NEATLY
1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO ADDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING IN THE CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GORWORTH STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE PARADES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON OORCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMBERLESS OTHER DETAILS
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTE COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN A CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS THE PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE
1585-131718-0033 THE EXPERIENCES WITH THE LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A ROUND
1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEAR SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEEHIVE DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARDONAIS OF THE CLERK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM OFF IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGRS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND OR PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT
1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT A MATTER
1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBER ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO DE NO NOTICE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMESE
1585-131718-0044 HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING A VIOLIN
1585-131718-0045 ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH THE VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME INTO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLINS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRES
1585-131718-0048 HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FLOWER LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLERS DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN'S STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAND FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS ALLING FIRST
1585-131718-0051 I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THAT COAT
1585-131718-0052 THEN THEY GOT PLEURACINE AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF CATCHING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS PROPOSED
1585-157660-0000 LONDON IS GO AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MEN ARE MOADED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECAME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMNS OF THE OLD STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAMS STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UTTERED THE FOLLOWING ORRITORICAL FLIGHT
1585-157660-0003 GLORIOUSLY LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WONDERFUL ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEAT IN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DWELLING COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERING AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE INFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHEUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THE SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD OF GLOWING EXPECTATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPORTATION'S FOULS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST E PROMISES AND OFT HE HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLITS
1585-157660-0009 DOSIS ONE DABIL WHEN SIX IS TREBACOY
1585-157660-0010 WILLEM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CENOPOD WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION
1585-157660-0011 THIS POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE A WORD FOR IT
1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SENT MY LIFE UPON THE CASTE AND WOULD WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BU PAPS SHE WAS FONDLING IN HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD DROPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCIVE
1585-157660-0015 THE PREENIC'S SHOP OF FOWL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVERN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES BURRYBRIDGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS PLUMP MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY RECENT TRAVELS ON THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING HAS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE WORLD
1630-102884-0004 THE PRINCIPALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FROM OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY ACQUIRED A STRONG LOVE OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT EPOCH OF THE SOUL OF A PEOPLE THE MAHABADA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS STIRRED IN MY COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT CONTRADICTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF HER VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ODOR WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND IS IN HARMONY WITH OUR VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 BUT SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GRIP OF AN INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE AND GROWTH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING SOULS INTO A PROMINENT PASSIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEIR OWN INTRINSIC DESIGNS AND OF MASTERING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION IS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING OUR STEPS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND OF FIGHTING IN FRIENDSHIP'S CAUSE
1630-102884-0016 IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECTS OF INERTIA WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUTH AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY BOTH WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND OUTSIDE
1630-141772-0000 ON THE CRADZEN HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAGSTAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND CHILD LIKE MOAN
1630-141772-0001 SUDDENLY SHE AGAIN FELT THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BURNING LACERATING PAIN IN HIS HEAD
1630-141772-0002 WAS HIS LAST THOUGHT
1630-141772-0003 HE FEEBLY MOVED HIS NECK AND UTTERED A WEAK SICKLY GROAN WHICH AROUSED HIS OWN PITY
1630-141772-0004 LIFT THIS YOUNGER MAN UP AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TERRIBLE PAIN OF BEING LIFTED ON TO THE STRETCHER THE JOLTING WHILE BEING SMOOTHED AND THE PROBING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0006 DURING THIS TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPOKE
1630-141772-0007 HE PASSED ON SEEING THE PRISONERS
1630-141772-0008 I COMMANDED AS SQUADRON REPLIED REPNON
1630-141772-0009 PRINCE REPNIN NAMED LIEUTENANT SUCTELL
1630-141772-0010 AFTER LOOKING AT HIM NAPOLEON EXCLAIMED
1630-141772-0011 YOUTH IS NO HINDRANCE TO COURAGE MUTTERED SUCCOLAND IN A FAILING VOICE
1630-141772-0012 A SPLENDID REPLY TO NAPOLEON
1630-141772-0013 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYES TO COMPLETE THE SHOW OF PRISONERS COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHINING WITH SELF SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE
1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD ICORN PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOUR THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY NOW HASTENED TO REPAIR THE HOLY IMAGE
1630-141772-0016 POOR ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED BUT THE LITTLE ICON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT UD BE TO KNOW WHERE TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND WHAT TO EXPECT WITHOUT IT BEYOND THE GRAVE
1630-141772-0018 HOW HAPPY AND CALM I SHOULD BE IF I COULD NOW SAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME
1630-141772-0019 EITHER TO A POWER INDEFINABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHICH I NOT ONLY CANNOT ADDRESS BUT WHICH I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS IN WORDS THE GREAT ALL TO NOTHING SAID HE TO HIMSELF OR TO THAT GOD WHO HAS BEEN SOWN INTO THIS AMULET BY MARY
1630-141772-0020 THE STRETCHERS MOVED
1630-141772-0021 THE QUIET HOME LIFE AND PEACEFUL HAPPINESS OF BUD HILLS PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM
1630-141772-0022 HE IS A NERVOUS BILIOUS SUBJECT SAID LARRY AND MAY NOT RECOVER
1630-73710-0000 IT IS IN THE FOOT OF WOMAN THAT WE LAY THE LAURELS THAT WITHOUT HER SMILE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GAINED IT IS HER IMAGE THAT STRINGS THE LYRE OF THE POET THAT ANIMATES OUR VOICE IN THE BLAZE OF ELOQUENT FACTION AND GUIDES HER BRAIN IN THE AUGUST TOILS OF STATELY COUNCILS
1630-73710-0001 IS THERE NO HOPE FOR THEM AND SO FULL OF HOPE
1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE YET TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO THE IMAGINATION
1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCUR FLITS OVER THE MIND LIKE A THOUGHT OF DEATH OBSCURING ALL OUR GAY FANCIES WITH ITS BAT LIKE WING AND TAINTING THE HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF OUR HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPIRATIONS
1630-73710-0004 MINE ALL
1630-73710-0005 ARE DEAD WHAT COULD YOU DO
1630-73710-0006 I BET ABOUT MY CHAMBER LIKE A FIELDY BIRD IN A CAGE
1630-73710-0007 DO THINK OF MOVING TO DAY
1630-73710-0008 DO NOT KEEP THE MESSENGER IN INSTANT
1630-73710-0009 KISS UP MY PONY
1630-73710-0010 WRITE ONLY ONE WORD TO YOUR SON HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0011 FADNANT TO HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0012 GOD BLESS YOU MY HENRIETTA MY BELOVED MY MATCHLESS HENRIETTO
1630-73710-0013 WHAT HAS THAT SEPARATION NOT COST TO ME
1630-73710-0014 PANGS THAT I SHOULD NOT CONCEIVE ANY HUMAN MISERY COULD OCCASION
1630-73710-0015 AND YET I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT HE WAS UNINJURED
1630-73710-0016 I DARE NOT NOW I OWN HOW FOOLISH I WAS
1630-73710-0017 DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH THE HENRIETTA BUT I'M NERVOUS ABOUT CONCEALING OUR ENGAGEMENT FROM PAPA
1630-73710-0018 DAYS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE YOU CAN REACH BATH AND I KNOW FERDINAND I KNOW YOUR LIFE IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WILL CONFESS
1630-73710-0019 BUT COME BACK MY OWN AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND WRITE TO ME AT THE POST OFFICE AS WE'RE SETTLED
1630-73710-0020 THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YOU'RE SO NEAR MAKE ME RESTLESS
1630-73710-0021 I WISH TO MEET HIM WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS AS I CAN DEMAND
1630-96099-0000 THAT TOO SIR YOU WOULD OF COURSE UNDERTAKE
1630-96099-0001 THEN SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HE HAS SOME FRESH INFORMATION SOME GREAT NEWS
1630-96099-0002 WHEN BLORE APPEARED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH HIM
1630-96099-0003 COME NOW JUST WHEN WE MOST WARNED HIM NEVER
1630-96099-0004 ETIATE TRIPLE ADIATE
1630-96099-0005 YOU SHALL BE DISMISSED DISCHARGED FROM THE CZAR YOU A DISGRACE TO THE FORCE
1630-96099-0006 IT IS THAT OF YOUR GREATEST GLUTTONY
1630-96099-0007 THIS GENTLEMAN MADE HIMSELF MOST PLEASANT
1630-96099-0008 WELL AT ANY RATE OF MY SINS I ACCEPTED
1630-96099-0009 WE ENTERED THE FIRST RESTAURANT THAT OF THE REUNITED TRENTS YOU KNEW IT PERHAPS MISSUS
1630-96099-0010 I HAD NO FEAR OF HIM NOT TILL THE VERY LAST WHEN HE PLAYED ME THIS ILL TURN
1630-96099-0011 I SUSPECTED NOTHING WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT HIS POCKETBOOK IT WAS STUFFED FULL MESSIEURS I SAW THAT AND MY CONFERENCE INCREASED CALLED FOR THE RECKONING AND PAID WITH AN ITALIAN BANK NOTE
1630-96099-0012 EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT I PRAY
1630-96099-0013 HE WENT OUT MESSIER AND PIFFAR HE WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN
1630-96099-0014 WHY LET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIDE
1630-96099-0015 IT WAS ONLY NOW AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR THAT THE ITALIANS HAD BECOME INCULPATED AND THE QUESTION OF HIS POSSIBLE ANXIETY TO ESCAPE HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED
1630-96099-0016 IT LEFT EVERYTHING BEHIND
1630-96099-0017 HAND IT TO ME SAID THE CHIEF AND WHEN IT CAME FROM HIS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES HURRIEDLY
1630-96099-0018 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND NOT MORE THAN A WORD HERE AN THERE
1630-96099-0019 IT IS NO DOUBT ESSENTIAL
1630-96099-0020 OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WOULD NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OR OF MAKING INQUIRY AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE
1630-96099-0021 IT WAS A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED LIRERA A HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS HA
1630-96099-0022 HE WAS MUCH PRESSED IN A GREATER HURRY
1630-96099-0023 DIRECTLY HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED THAT DEVIL
1630-96099-0024 THEY WISHED TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT THEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CAB AND WERE DRIVEN AWAY TOGETHER
1650-157641-0000 THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARD SUFFERING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER WAS CURIOUS
1650-157641-0001 NOW MISSUS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IT IN A SMOKING HUMOR AND SHALL PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHT
1650-157641-0002 BUT SEE WHEN YOU ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU
1650-157641-0003 THE DWARF'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE CAREFUL
1650-157641-0004 BUT KELP AND BRASS WERE NOW IN SOCIETY
1650-157641-0005 THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE OPONETTES AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO
1650-157641-0006 ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THE GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATES SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR SMOKE AMONG OFFICERS OF THE ARMY
1650-157641-0007 THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ODOUR OF TOBACCO AND THE DISTRUSTED MAN WHO SMOKED
1650-157641-0008 HERE IS FIST TUDO'S OR THACKERAY'S COMMENT ON IT WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
1650-157641-0009 I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT THOSE WOMEN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RIVAL
1650-157641-0010 I WOULD LAY A GUINEA BUT THE MAN WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I'M A SMOKER AND SAYS O THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE
1650-157641-0011 GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR THREESCORE YEARS FRANCE SMOKED TO A MAN
1650-157641-0012 PSHAH LOOKING AT HIS PROGRESS
1650-157641-0013 THUS THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS NOW BROUGHT INTO OUR DRAWING ROOM
1650-157641-0014 THE JOURNALISTS AND THE BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THEIR COGERS WERE ABOUT WERE BELOW THE DEEP TASTE OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS
1650-157641-0015 BOTH QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE PRINCE CONSOR DETESTED IT SO TOBACCO WAS TABOOS WHEREVER THE COURT WAS
1650-167613-0000 THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT PRINCE ANDREW APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED HIM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA
1650-167613-0001 SEAS WERE BROUGHT IN AND THE SOIL WAS THIRTY
1650-167613-0002 THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT THE PEER'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF THE MALUSICOTE AND THE POSITION OF OUR ARMY FROM WHICH HE HAD ARISEN
1650-167613-0003 AS YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS
1650-167613-0004 NOW BEING A MILITARY MAN YOU CAN'T SAY YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL POSITION
1650-167613-0005 WELL THEN YOU KNOW MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE BE IT WHO IT MAY SAID POOR ANDREW
1650-167613-0006 AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BRACLAY DE TOLLY
1650-167613-0007 CLEAR LOOKED AT MALCOLM WITH THE CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH EVERYBODY INVOLUNTARILY ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER
1650-167613-0008 WE SEE LIGHT AGAIN SINCE HIS SERENITY HAS BEEN APPOINTED YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID MIKE IN TIMIDLY AND CONTINUALLY TURNING TO GLANCE AT HIS COLONEL
1650-167613-0009 WHY SO AS THE PEER
1650-167613-0010 THE WHY WAS IT FORBIDDEN
1650-167613-0011 AT SMOLENSK TOO HE JUDGED CORRECTLY THAT THE FRENCH MIGHT OUTFLANK US AS WE HAD LARGE FORCES
1650-167613-0012 HE ORDERED US TO RETREAT IN ALL OUR EFFORTS AND ALLOWANCES WENT FOR NOTHING
1650-167613-0013 SOWY THE ASPENS WITH BARLEY
1650-167613-0014 WELL RUSSIAN WAS WELL A FOREIGNER COULD SERVE HER AND BE A SPLENDID A MINISTER BUT AS SOON AS SHE IS IN DANGER SHE NEEDS ONE OF HER OWN KIN
1650-167613-0015 AND THEY SAY HE IS A SKILFUL COMMANDER REJOINED PEERS
1650-167613-0016 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MEANT BY A SKILFUL COMMANDER REPLIED MISTER ANDREW IRONICALLY
1650-167613-0017 A SUCCESSFUL COMMANDER REPLIED THE PEER
1650-167613-0018 PURE LOOKED AT THEM IN SURPRISE
1650-167613-0019 AND YET THEY SAY THAT THE WAR'S LIKE A GAME OF CHESS HE REMARKED
1650-167613-0020 THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF BODIES OF TROOP COULD NEVER BE KNOWN TO ANYONE
1650-167613-0021 SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ON OFFICERS AND THE LEAST OF ALL ON POSITION BUT ON WHAT THEN
1650-167613-0022 AND THE FEELING THAT IS IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMALKIN THAT HE IS SOLDIER
1650-167613-0023 MY BATTLE IS WON BY THOSE WHO FIRMLY RESOLVE TO WIN IT
1650-167613-0024 WHY DID WE LOSE THE BATTLE AT THE OUSBULLAS
1650-167613-0025 WE'RE LOUSED SO LET US RUN AND WE RUN
1650-167613-0026 BUT WE SHA'N'T SAY IT
1650-167613-0027 BUT AS WHAT A WEIGHT HAS TO MORROW
1650-167613-0028 THE FACT IS THAT THOSE MEN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE RIDDEN AROUND A POSITION NOT ONLY TO NOW HELP MATTERS BUT TO HINDER
1650-167613-0029 THAT'S THE TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH SAID MANKIN
1650-167613-0030 IT IS NOT THE DAY FOR THAT THEY SAY
1650-167613-0031 I WERE SALENT THE OFFICERS ROSE
1650-167613-0032 YES YES ANSWERED THE PRINCE ANGRILY ABSENTLY
1650-167613-0033 THE FRENCH HAS DESTROYED MY HOME AND THE ONLY WAY TO DESTROY MARSICO THEY HAVE OUTRAGED AND ARE OUTRAGING ME EVERY MOMENT THEE ARE MY ENEMIES
1650-167613-0034 IN MY OPINION THEY ARE ALL ORIGINALS
1650-167613-0035 AND SO THINKS TIMANALKI AND THE WHOLE ARMY
1650-167613-0036 SINCE THEY ARE MY FOES THEY CANNOT BE MY FRIENDS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SAID AT THIS TUSIT
1650-167613-0037 YES YES MUTTERED PETER LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES AT THE PRINCE ANGEL
1650-167613-0038 THEY TALK TO US OF RULES OF WAR OF CHIVALRY OF FLAGS OF TRUTHS OF MERCY TO THE UNFORTUNATE AND SO ON AS OUR RUBBISH
1650-167613-0039 THE PLUNDER OF OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES ISHUFT'S PAPER MONEY AND WORST OF ALL THEY KILL MY CHILDREN AND MY FATHER AND THEN TALK OF RULES OF WAR AND MAGNANIMITY TO FOES
1650-167613-0040 TAKE NO PRISONERS BY THEIR KEEL AND BE KILLED
1650-167613-0041 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD FELT IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER OR NOT MASSACA WAS TAKEN AS MAROLENSK HAD BEEN WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED IN HIS SPEECH BY AN UNEXPECTED CRAMMY HIS THROAT
1650-167613-0042 HE PACED UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES IN SILENCE BUT HIS EYES GLITTERED FEVERISHLY AND HIS LIMB QUIVERED AS HE BEGAN SPEAKING
1650-167613-0043 AND WHEN THERE WAS A WAR LIKE THIS ONE IT SHOULD BE A WAR
1650-167613-0044 WHAT IS NEEDED FOR SOCIETY IN WARFARE
1650-167613-0045 BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS IT IS THE HIGHEST CLASS RESPECTED BY EVERY ONE
1650-167613-0046 HOW DOES SKY ABOVE LOOK AT THEM OR HEAR THEM
1650-167613-0047 I SEE THAT I HAVE MANAGED TO UNDERSTAND TOO MUCH
1650-167613-0048 AND IT DOESN'T DO FOR MEN TO TASTE OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL AH WELL IT IS NOT FORE LONG HE ADDED
1650-167613-0049 HOWEVER YOU WERE SLEEPY AND IT'S TIME FOR ME TO SLEEP

1650-167613-0052 NO HE DOES NOT WANT IT PIERRE INTERRUPTED
1650-167613-0053 AH I KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING
1650-167613-0054 ONE PICTURE SUCCEEDED ANOTHER AT HIS IMAGINATION
1650-167613-0055 ON ONE OF THEM SHE DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY
1650-173551-0000 HIS MAJORDOMO CAME IN A SECOND TIME TO SAY THAT THE FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THE LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND THAT SOME ONE FROM BOZADIEV'S WIDOW HAD A COW TO ASK PIERRE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOK AS SHE HERSELF WAS LEAVING FOR THE COUNTRY
1650-173551-0001 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE PASSAGES
1650-173551-0002 THE HAL PORTER WAS STANDING AT THE FRONT DOORWAY
1650-173551-0003 FROM THE LANDING WHERE PIERRE STOOD THERE WAS A SECOND STAIR CASE LEADING TO THE BACK ENTRANCE
1650-173551-0004 HE WENT DOWN THE STAIRCASE AND OUT INTO THE YARD NO ONE HAVING SEEN HIM
1650-173551-0005 WHEN HE FELT THAT HE WAS BEING LOOKED AT HE BEHAVED LIKE AN OSTERBRIDGE WHICH HIDE ITS HEAD IN THE BUSH IN ORDER NOT TO BE SEEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND QUICKENING HIS PACE WENT DOWN THE STREET
1650-173551-0006 HE HIRED THE FIRST A CAB HE MET AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE PATRICK'S POUNCE WHERE THE WIDOW BADSITIVES HOUSE WAS
1650-173551-0007 THIS WAS THE AUTHENTIC SCOTCH ACTS WITH PATHATIVE'S NOTES AND EXCLAMATIONS
1650-173551-0008 HE SAT DOWN ON THE DUSTY WRITING TABLE AND HAVING LAID THE MANUSCRIPT BEFORE HIM OPENED THEM OUT CLOSED THEM FINALLY PUSHED THEM AWAY AND RESTING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND SANK INTO MEDICATION
1650-173551-0009 MAKARY ALEXANDROVITCH CAME TWICE THAT EVENING SHUFFLING ALONG IN HIS GLASHES AS FAR AS THE DOOR AND STOPPED AND LOOKED INGRATIATINGLY AT PIERRE
1650-173552-0000 AT THAT VERY TIME AT TEN IN THE MORNING OF THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER NAPOLEON WAS STANDING AMONG HIS TROOPS ON THE PYCHLONIAN HEEL LOOKING AT THE PANORAMAS SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM
1650-173552-0001 THE GREYNESS OF THE MORNING WAS MAGICAL
1650-173552-0002 BUT IN MY CLEMENCY IS ALWAYS READY TO DESCEND UPON THE VANQUISHED
1650-173552-0003 YET HERE SHE IS LYING AT MY FEET WITH HER GOLDEN DOMES AND CROSSES SINKINGLLATING IN A TWINKLING IN THE SUNSHINE
1650-173552-0004 BUT I SHALL SPARE
1650-173552-0005 FROM THE HIDE OF THE KREMELIN YES THE HERE IS THE KREMELIN YES I WILL GIVE THEM JUST THE LOUGHS I WILL TEACH THEM THE MEANING OF TRUE CIVILIZATION I WILL MAKE GENERATIONS OF BOYARS REMEMBER THEIR CONQUEROR WITH LAUD
1650-173552-0006 I WILL TELL THE DEPUTATION THAT I DENOUNCE AND DO NOT DESIRE WAR THAT I'VE WAGED THE WAR ONLY AGAINST THE FALSE POLICY OF THEIR COURT THAT I LOVE AND RESPECT ALEXANDER AND THAT IN MASSACRE I WILL ACCEPT TERMS OF PEACE WORTHY OF MYSELF AND OF MY PEOPLE
1650-173552-0007 I DO NOT WISH TO UTILIZE THE FORCES OF WAR TO HUMILIATE AND HONOR THE MONARCH
1650-173552-0008 YOU'LL HAVE TO BE TOLD ALL THE SAME SAYS SOME GENTLEMAN OF THE SUITE BUT GENTLEMEN
1650-173552-0009 A SINGLE REPORT OF THE SINKING GUN FOLLOWED AND THE TROOPS WHO WERE ALREADY SPREAD OUT ON DIFFERENT SIDES SOUTH MOSCOW MOVED INTO THE CITY THROUGH VORD KALOUGA AND DARGOMALEVKAS
1651-136854-0000 IN SIXTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER FOR WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED A MAJESTIC TEACHER OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WISDOM
1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH HE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH HE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FURTHER OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING MY PAPER I WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO NAME IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN AT NIGHT UPON MY BED SIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP UNTIL I HAD FIXED ITS TITLE
1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMBLED TOGETHER IN AS AWED A MANNER AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHING EFFECT
1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS JOHNSON'S ABBREVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINGUISHED AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD IS MENTIONED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING SPECIMEN ONE
1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF BAD HABITS NEGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED THE TIME
1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENCE OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING AS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECT TO BE TRUSTED
1651-136854-0009 YOUTH AMBITIOUS IS THINKING HONOURS EASY TO BE HAD
1651-136854-0010 THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRAISE PURSUED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCIENT MANHOOD
1651-136854-0012 FOUR
1651-136854-0013 SQUIRE'S FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADIES
1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO IT BY WORDS REPELLED BY PASSIONS
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY RUN
1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY HINDERS COMPLINCE
1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCES INSOLENCE AND INJURY
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD IN EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST TOO
1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIORS ANY ONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED SCARCE EVER MADE CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MANY AGAINST NINE
1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO WRONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION BUT I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE WILL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MORE READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE BROTHER CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GUARD AND EXCITE AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN USELESS WISE AND INNOCENT AND A DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND WHOLLY
1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENIES YOU TO THINK THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLY YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 NUMBER THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANT OF STOICISM AS THE SUN OF REVOLUTION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENTENCES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMETHING OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRATES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABBLER TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT IN A LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAS FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTERWOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES DIFFER AS IN PLAIN CLOTH AND BROCADE
1686-142278-0000 HE WAS
1686-142278-0001 NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES WITH CRIMSON AND AMBER TINTS
1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY CATCHING CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN
1686-142278-0003 HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF ITS BRIEF SUCCESS AND ALL THE SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECT OF HIS DESIRES O DEAR
1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THAT WHIRL OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER
1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD THE PROSPECTS ALL TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0006 THEY FORGOT THAT HE HAD NOT MADE THEM AN OFFER
1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING BEDTIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY
1686-142278-0008 OR
1686-142278-0009 BUT I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0010 VERY SERIOUS TO YOU ALL
1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER AFTER HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK OF HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANSWER FOR THE MINUTE OR TWO
1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THOSE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0015 BUT YOUR DEAR PAPA DO TELL ME
1686-142278-0016 BECAUSE I MAY NO LONGER BE A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
1686-142278-0017 BUT NOTHING FOR THE SHOCK SHE RECEIVED FROM MISTER HALE'S LAST SPEECH WHAT COULD HE MEAN
1686-142278-0018 THIS WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR BEING SO MYSTERIOUS
1686-142278-0019 BUT WHY CAN YOU NO LONGER BE A CLERGYMAN
1686-142278-0020 SURELY IF THE BISHOP WERE TOLD ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT FREDERICK AND THE HARD AND JUST
1686-142278-0021 ROBERT I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
1686-142278-0022 I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS ONES BUT AFTER TO NIGHT LET US NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN
1686-142278-0023 I CAN METE THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY PAINFUL MISERABLE DOUBTS BUT IT IS AN ERROR BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING
1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTING AS TO RELIGION NOT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THAT HE PAUSED
1686-142278-0025 MARGARET PAUSED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEW HORROR
1686-142278-0026 MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE HOLY CHURCH FROM WHICH I HAVE TO BE SHUT OUT
1686-142278-0027 HE COULD NOT GO FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
1686-142278-0028 MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF THE FATHER WERE ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETAN
1686-142278-0029 THAT ONE STAYED FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING
1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE USE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW INVOLVED
1686-142278-0031 LISTEN DEAR MARGARET SAID HE PUTTING ONE ARM ALONG HER WAIST
1686-142278-0032 WHEN GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND LET HE WILL IN ANOTHER
1686-142278-0033 IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT AN ORDER A CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY
1686-142278-0034 AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE THAT HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING
1686-142278-0035 I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACHES THAT WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MIND LESS TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE
1686-142278-0036 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS IT WENT ON
1686-142278-0037 MARGARET I TRIED TO DO IT I TRY TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THE ADDITIONAL PREFERMENT AND STOPPING QUIETLY HERE STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
1686-142278-0038 AND GOD FORGIVE ME
1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE HALL SPEAKING LOW WORDS OF SELF REPROACH AND HUMILIATION OF WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT A FEW
1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD LADY BURDEN WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE
1686-142278-0041 AS
1686-142278-0042 I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP I DARESAY I HAVE TOLD YOU SO BUT I FORGET THINGS JUST NOW SAID MISTER HALE COLLAPSING INTO HIS DEPRESSED MANNER AS SOON AS HE CAME TO TALK OF HARD MATTER OF FACT DETAILS INFORMING HIM OF MY INTENTION TO RESIGN THAT VICARAGE
1686-142278-0043 THEY ARE BUT WHAT I HAVE TRIED UPON MYSELF WITHOUT A WHILE
1686-142278-0044 THAT WILL BE A TRIAL BUT WORSE FAR WORSE WOULD BE THE DEPARTING FROM MY DEAR PEOPLE
1686-142278-0045 WHO WILL COME TO STAY WITH US TO MORROW
1686-142278-0046 WAS IT TO BE SO SOON THEN
1686-142278-0047 WHAT DOES MAMMA SAID

1686-142278-0050 PERHAPS AFTER ALL SHE MAY NOT KNOW YES
1686-142278-0051 SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED AS THE FORCE OF A BLOW RETURNED UPON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALISE HOW ANOTHER WOULD TAKE IT
1686-142278-0052 TO MILTON NORTHERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DRY INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENNESS OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER MIND
1686-142278-0053 MILTON LONDON
1686-142278-0054 YES SAID HE IN HIS SAME DESPONDENT INDIFFERENT WAY
1686-142278-0055 BUT HE WITH HIS QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ IN HER FACE AS IN A MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNED IT OUT WITH AN EFFORT
1686-142278-0056 YOU SHALL BE TOLD ALL ROBERT
1686-142278-0057 ONLY HELP ME TO TELL YOUR BROTHER

1686-142278-0060 MARGARET DID DISLIKE IT DID SHRINK FROM IT MORE THAN FOR ANYTHING SHE HAD EVER HAD TO DO IN HER LIFE BEFORE
1686-142278-0061 DOCTOR HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDINGLY HE PRESSED HER HAND IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
1686-142278-0062 MARGARET WAS NEARLY UPSET AGAIN INTO A BURST OF CRIES
1686-142278-0063 TO TURN MY THOUGHTS SHE SAID NOW TELL ME PAPA WHAT OUR PLANS ARE

1686-142278-0071 I I CANNOT STAND OBJECTIONS
1686-142278-0072 THEY MAKE YOU SO UNDECIDED

1686-142278-0076 I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU GAVE ME MUCH STRENGTH
1686-142278-0077 A PRIMITIVE TUTOR
1686-142278-0078 SAID MARGARET LOOKING SCORNFUL WHAT IN THE WORLD DO MANUFACTURES WANT WITH THE CLASSICS FOR LITERATURE OR THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A GENTLEMAN

1686-142278-0081 AND IN MYTON MARGARET I SHALL FIND A BUSY LIFE IF NOT A HAPPY ONE AND PEOPLE AND SCENES SO DIFFERENT THAT I SHALL NEVER BE REMINDED OF HELSTONE

1686-142278-0095 THE BLESSING OF GOD WAS UPON THEE MY CHILD
1686-142278-0096 THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FEARED LEST THE ANSWER TO HIS BLESSING MIGHT BE IRREVERENT WRONG MIGHT HURT HIM AS COMING FROM HIS DAUGHTER AND SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK

1686-142278-0098 THEY WERE STARTLED BY HEARING MISSUS HALE INQUIRING TO HER DAUGHTER
1701-141759-0000 IT WAS LONG SINCE THE ROSTOVS HAD NEWS OF ANYBODY
1701-141759-0001 NOT TILL MIDWINTER WAS THE COUNT AT LAST HANDED A LETTER ADDRESSED IN HIS WIFE'S HANDWRITING
1701-141759-0002 ON RECEIVING IT HE RAN ON TIPTOE INTO HIS STUDY IN ALARM AND HASTE TRYING TO ESCAPE NOTICE CLOSED THE DOOR AND BEGAN TO READ THE LETTER
1701-141759-0003 EACH TIME THAT THEY HINTS BEGAN TO MAKE THE COUNTESS ANXIOUS AND SHE GLANCED UNEASILY AT THE COUNT AND AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA THE LATTER VERY ADROITLY TURNED THE CONVERSATION TO INSIGNIFICANT MATTERS
1701-141759-0004 BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE BE CAREFUL YOU KNOW HOW IT MAY AFFECT YOUR WIFE
1701-141759-0005 NO ON MY TRUE WORD OF HONOR SAID NATASHA CROSSING HERSELF I WON'T TELL ANYTHING

1701-141759-0017 SHE PERCEIVED IT COULD BE BUT DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT
1701-141759-0018 SHALL YOU WRITE TO HER SHE ASKED
1701-141759-0019 NOW THAT HE WAS ALREADY AN OFFICER AND A WOUNDED HERO WOULD IT BE RIGHT TO REMIND HIM OF HERSELF AND AS IT MIGHT SEEM THE OBLIGATIONS TO HER HE HAD TAKEN ON HIMSELF
1701-141759-0020 I DON'T KNOW THAT
1701-141759-0021 SONYA SMILES THOUGH
1701-141759-0022 IT'S BECAUSE SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THAT FAT ONE IN SPECTACLES THAT WAS HOW PETYA DESCRIBED HIS NAMESAKE THE NEW COUNT BEZUKHOV AND NOW SHE'S IN LOVE WITH THAT SINGER YOU MET NATASHA'S ITALIAN SINGING MASTER THAT'S WHY SHE'S ASHAMED

1701-141759-0024 THE COUNTESS HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S HINTS AT DINNER
1701-141759-0025 ON RETIRING TO HER OWN ROOM SHE SAT IN AN ARMCHAIR HER EYES FIXED ON A MINIATURE PORTRAIT OF HER FATHER ON THE LID OF A SNUFF BOX WHILE THE TEARS KEPT COMING INTO HER EYES
1701-141759-0026 THE COLONEL PUT HIS EAR TO THE KEYHOLE AND LISTENED
1701-141759-0027 AT FIRST HE HEARD THE SOUND OF INDIFFERENT VOICES THEN ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S VOICE ALONE IN A LONG SPEECH THEN A CRY THEN SILENCE THEN BOTH VOICES TOGETHER WITH GLAD INTONATIONS THEN FOOTSTEPS
1701-141759-0028 ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OPENED DOOR
1701-141759-0029 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS SONYA BLUSHED SO THAT TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES AND UNABLE TO BEAR THE LOOKS TURNED UPON HER RAN AWAY INTO THE DANCING HALL WHIRLING ROUND IT AT FULL SPEED WITH HER DRESS PUFFED OUT LIKE A BALLOON AND FLUSHED AND SMILING PLUMPED DOWN ON THE FLOOR
1701-141759-0030 THE COUNTESS WAS LAUGHING
1701-141759-0031 FROM ALL HE SAYS ONE SHOULD BE GLAD BUT NOT CRY
1701-141759-0032 HOW CHARMINGLY HE DESCRIBES SAID SHE READING THE DESCRIPTIVE PART OF THIS LETTER AND WHAT A SOUL
1701-141759-0033 I ALWAYS SAID WHEN HE WAS REALLY SO HIGH I ALWAYS SAID
1701-141760-0000 THE PAVLOV GRADES HELD FEAST AFTER FEAST CELEBRATING AWARDS THEY HAD RECEIVED FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND MADE EXPEDITIONS TO OLMUES TO VISIT A CERTAIN CAROLINA HUNGARIAN WHO HAD RECENTLY OPENED A RESTAURANT THERE WITH GIRLS AS WAITRESSES
1701-141760-0001 THE GUARDS HAD MADE THEIR WHOLE MARCH AS IF IN A PLEASURE TRIP PARADING THEIR CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE
1701-141760-0002 THE REGIMENTS HAD ENTERED AND LEFT THE TOWN WITH THEIR BANDS PLAYING AND BY THE GRAND DUKE'S ORDERS THE MEN HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY IN STEPE A PRACTICE ON WHICH THE GUARDS PRIDED THEMSELVES THE OFFICERS ON FOOT AND AT THEIR PROPER POSTS
1701-141760-0003 BORRIS HAD BEEN QUARTERED AND HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY WITH BERG WHO WAS ALREADY IN COMMAND OF A COMPANY
1701-141760-0004 BORIS DURING THE CAMPAIGN HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MANY PERSONS WHO MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO HIM AND BY A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION HE HAD BROUGHT FROM PIERRE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI THROUGH WHOM HE HOPED TO OBTAIN A POST IN THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF STAFF
1701-141760-0005 BERTHE AND BORIS HAVING RESTED AFTER YESTERDAY'S MARCH WERE SITTING CLEAN AND NEATLY DRESSED AT A ROUND TABLE IN THE CLEAN QUARTERS ALLOTTED TO THEM PLAYING CHESS
1701-141760-0006 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT HE REMARKED
1701-141760-0007 AT THAT MINUTE THE DOOR OPENED
1701-141760-0008 DEAR ME HOW YOU HA CHANGED
1701-141760-0009 HE WAS ABOUT TO EMBRACE HIS FRIENDS WHEN NICHOLAS AVOIDED HIM
1701-141760-0010 HE WANTED TO PINCH HIM PUSH HIM DO ANYTHING BUT KICK HIM A THING EVERYBODY DID
1701-141760-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS BORIS EMBRACED HIM IN A QUIET FRIENDLY WAY AND KISSED THEM THREE TIMES
1701-141760-0012 THEY HAD NOT MET FOR NEARLY HALF A YEAR AND BEING AT THE AGE WHEN YOUNG MEN MAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS ON LIFE'S ROAD EACH SAW IMMENSE CHANGES IN THE OTHER QUITE A NEW REFLECTION OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN THOSE FIRST STEPS
1701-141760-0013 I DID NOT EXPECT YOU TO SAY HE ADDED
1701-141760-0014 YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT HIS IMPERIAL HIGHNESS RODE WITH OUR REGIMENT ALL THE TIME SO THAT THEY HAD EVERY COMFORT AND EVERY ADVANTAGE
1701-141760-0015 WHAT RECEPTIONS WE HAD IN POLARS
1701-141760-0016 WHAT DINNERS AND BALLS I CAN NOT TELL YOU
1701-141760-0017 OH YOU GUARDS SAID ROSTOV I SAYS SEND FOR SOME WINE
1701-141760-0018 HE WENT TO HIS BED DREW A PARSAN UNDER THE CLEAN PILLOW AND SENT FOR WINE
1701-141760-0019 YES AND I HAVE SOME MONEY AND OF LETTERS TO GIVE YOU HE ADDED
1701-141760-0020 OH DON'T MENTION IT TOM I QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID BORG GETTING UP AND SPEAKING IN A MUFFLED AND GUTTURAL VOICE
1701-141760-0021 GO ACROSS TO OUR HOST'S THEY INVITED YOU ADDED BORIS
1701-141760-0022 BERG PUT ON THE CLEANEST OF COATS WITHOUT A SPOT OR SPECK OF DUST STOOD BEFORE A LOOKING GLASS AND BRUSHED THE HAIR ON HIS TEMPLES UPWARDS IN THE WAY AFFECTED BY THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF FROM THE WAY ROSTOV LOOKED AT IT THAT HIS COACH HAD BEEN NOTICED LEFT THE ROOM WITH A PLEASANT SMILE
1701-141760-0023 OH DEAR WHAT A BEAST I AM ADDED ROSTOV AS HE READ THE LETTER WHY
1701-141760-0024 WELL HAVE YOU SENT GABRIEL FOR SOME WINE ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE SOMETHING
1701-141760-0025 IN THE LETTER FROM HIS PARENTS WAS INCLOSED A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION TO BAGRATION WHICH THE OLD COUNTESS AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S ADVICE HAD OBTAINED THROUGH AN ACQUAINTANCE AND SENT TO HER SON ASKING HIM TO TAKE IT TO ITS DESTINATION AND MAKE USE OF IT
1701-141760-0026 WHERE HAVE YOU THROWN THAT AWAY ASKED BORIS
1701-141760-0027 IT IS HIS LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT THE DEVIL DO I WANT IT FOR
1701-141760-0028 HE LOOKED INTENTLY AND INQUIRINGLY INTO HIS FRIEND'S EYES APPARENTLY TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND THE ANSWER TO SOME QUESTION
1701-141760-0029 WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT COUNT I WAS NOT AT ALL ALARMED THOUGH I KNEW I WAS RIGHT
1701-141760-0030 I CAME FORWARD BERG STOOD UP AND SHOWED HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CAP BUT REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR A FACE TO EXPRESS GREATER RESPECT AND SELF COMPLACENCY THAN HIS DID
1701-141760-0031 WELL HE STORMING AT ME AS THE SAYING IS STORMED AND STORMED AND STORMED
1701-141760-0032 IT WAS NOT A MANNER OF LIFE BUT RATHER OF DEATH AS THE SAYING IS
1701-141760-0033 ALBANIANS AND DEVILS AND TO SIBERIA SAID GORG WITH A SAGACIOUS SMILE
1701-141760-0034 STILL I REMAINED SILENT AS WHAT DO YOU THINK COUNT
1701-141760-0035 THE NEXT DAY IT WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ORDERS FOR THE DAY
1701-141760-0036 THAT'S THE WEE COUNT SAID BERG LIGHTING HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE
1701-141760-0037 YES THAT WAS A FINE SAID ROSTOV SMILING
1701-141760-0038 ROSTOV WAS A TRUTHFUL YOUNG MAN AND SHOULD ON NO ACCOUNT HAVE TOLD A DELIBERATE LIE
1701-141760-0039 HE BEGAN HIS STORY MEANING TO TELL EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAD HAPPENED BUT IMPERCEPTIBLY INVOLUNTARILY AND INEVITABLY HE LAPSED INTO FALSEHOOD
1701-141760-0040 PRINCE ANDREW WHO LIKED TO HELP YOUNG MEN WAS FLATTERED BY BEING ASKED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE AND BEING WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS BORIS WHO HAD MANAGED TO PLEASE HIM THE DAY BEFORE HE WANTED TO DO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WANTED
1701-141760-0041 IN SPITE OF PRINCE ANDREW'S DISAGREEABLE IRONICAL TONE IN SPITE OF THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH ROSTOV FROM HIS FIGHTING ARMY POINT OF VIEW REGARDED ALL HIS LITTLE ADJUTANTS ON THE STAFF OF WHOM THE NEWCOMER WAS EVIDENTLY ONE ROSTOV FELT CONFUSED BLUSHED AND BECAME SILENT
1701-141760-0042 BORIS INQUIRED WHAT NEWS THERE MIGHT BE ON THE STAFF AND WHICH WITHOUT INDISCRETION ONE MIGHT ASK ABOUT OUR PLANS
1701-141760-0043 WE SHALL PROBABLY ADVANCE REPLIED BOLKOWSKY EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO SAY MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER
1701-141760-0044 BERG TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WITH GREAT POLITENESS WHETHER AS WAS RUMORED THE ALLOWANCE OF FORAGE MONEY TO CAPTAINS OF COMPANIES SHOULD BE DOUBLED
1701-141760-0045 I WAS THEN SAID ROSTOV ANGRILY AS IF INTENDING TO INSULT THE AIDE DE CAMP
1701-141760-0046 WITH A SILENT CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HE SAID YES THERE ARE MANY STORIES NOW TOLD ABOUT THAT AFFAIR
1701-141760-0047 BUT THE STORIES ARE THE STORIES OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER THE ENEMY'S FIRE
1701-141760-0048 OUR STORIES HAVE SOME WEIGHT NOT LIKE THE STORIES OF THOSE FELLOWS UPON THE STAFF WHO GET REWARDS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
1701-141760-0049 HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME BUT DON'T FORGET IT I DO NOT REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED AND AS A MAN OLDER THAN YOU MY ADVICE IS TO LET THE MATTER DROP
1701-141760-0050 EXCLAIMED POOR ANDREW AND WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH HE WENT OUT
1701-141760-0051 AND HE IS STILL MORE ANGRY AT HAVING OMITTED TO SEE IT
1701-141760-0052 HE ORDERED HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND COLDLY TAKING LEAVE OF BORIS RODE ALONG
1701-141760-0053 SHOULD HE GO TO HEADQUARTERS NEXT DAY AND CHALLENGE THIS AFFECTED ADJUTANT OR REALLY LET THE MATTER DROP WAS THE QUESTION THAT WORRIED HIM ALL THE WAY
2506-11267-0000 ICY SHORES OF THEM DEPARTED NOT PERHAPS WITHOUT AN INNATE LONGING TOO TO QUIT THE ISLAND ALONG WITH THOSE HAPPY SNOBS
2506-11267-0001 FAREWELL DEAR FRIENDS I SAY YOU LITTLE KNOW THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO REGARDS YOU FROM THIS BEACH IS YOUR FRIEND AND HISTORIOGRAPHER AND BROTHER
2506-11267-0002 I WENT TO DAY TO SEE OUR EXCELLENT FRIEND SNORKS ON BOARD THE QUEEN OF THE FRENCH MANY SCORES OF SNOBS WERE THERE ON THE DECK OF THAT FINE SHIP MARCHING FORTH IN THEIR PRIDE AND BRAVERY
2506-11267-0003 THEY WOULD BE AT OSTEND IN FOUR HOURS THEY WILL INUNDATE THE CONTINENT NEXT WEEK THEY WILL CARRY INTO FAR LANDS THE FAMOUS IMAGE OF THE BRITISH SNOB
2506-11267-0004 I HAVE SEEN SNOBS IN PINK COATS AND HUNTING BOOTS SCOURING OVER THE CAMPAGNA OF ROME AND HAVE HEARD THEIR RHEDES AND THEIR WELL KNOWN SLANG IN THE GALLERIES OF THE VATICAN AND UNDER THE SHADOWY ARCHES OF THE COLOSSEUM
2506-11267-0005 MY LADY MARCHIONESS COMES ON BOARD LOOKS ABOUT WITH THAT HAPPY AIR OF MINGLED TERROR AND IMPERTINENCE WHICH DISTINGUISHES HER LADYSHIP AND RUSHES TO HER CARRIAGE FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD MINGLE WITH THE OTHER SNOBS ON DECK
2506-11267-0006 THERE SHE SITS IT WILL BE ILL IN PRIVATE
2506-11267-0007 THE STRAWBERRY LEAVES ON THEIR CHARIOT PANELS ARE ENGRAVED ON HER LADYSHIP'S HEART
2506-11267-0008 AND DAVIS YOU'D BEST TAKE HIS PISTOL CASE INTO THE CABIN
2506-11267-0009 LOOK AT HONEST NATHAN HOUNDTITCH AND HIS LADY AND THEIR LITTLE SUM

2506-11267-0013 I HAVE SAID BEFORE I LIKE TO LOOK AT THE PEOPLES AND THEIR GALA DAYS THEY ARE SO PICTURESQUELY AND OUTRAGEOUSLY SPLENDID AND HAPPY
2506-11267-0014 YONDER COMES CAP'N BILL SPICK AND SPAN TIED AND TRIM WHO TRAVELS FOR FOUR OR SIX MONTHS EVERY YEAR OF HIS LIFE WHO DOES NOT COMMIT HIMSELF BY LUXURY OF RAIMENT OR INSOLENCE OF DEMEANOUR BUT I THINK HE IS AS GREAT A SNOB AS ANY MAN ON BOARD
2506-11267-0015 BILL PASSES THE SEASON IN LONDON SPONGING FOR DINNERS AND SLEEPING IN A GARRET AT HIS CLUB
2506-11267-0016 SEE HE'S UP TO OLD CARIBZ ALREADY I TOLD YOU HE WOULD

2506-11267-0018 THE NEXT PERSON IS NOT HARK
2506-11278-0000 WHEN A GROSS INSTANCE OF SNOBBISHNESS HAPPENS WHY SHOULD NOT THE INDIGNANT JOURNALIST CALL THE PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE DELINQUENCY TOO
2506-11278-0001 HOW FOR INSTANCE COULD THAT WONDERFUL CASE OF THE EARL OF MANTEL WURZEL AND HIS BROTHER BE EXAMINED IN THE SNOBBISH POINT OF VIEW
2506-11278-0002 ALL WE REQUIRE IS THAT A MAN SHOULD BE RECOMMENDED TO US BY THE EARL OF MANGEL WURZWSHIRE
2506-11278-0003 OH YOU PRIDE OF A SNOBBLEND

2506-11278-0006 HOW WILL YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE PRODIGIOUS BENEVOLENCE EXERCISED TOWARD THE INTERESTING YOUNG FRENCH LADY
2506-11278-0007 THE EARNEST BOARDING HOUSE PEOPLE WERE AT HER FEET AT ONCE
2506-11278-0008 GOOD HONEST SIMPLE WORDS LOVING CHILDREN OF SNOBLAND
2506-11278-0009 FINALLY THERE IS A CASE OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MISTER VERNON AT YORK
2506-11278-0010 THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WAS THE SON OF A NOBLEMAN AND PRACTICED UPON AN OLD LADY
2506-11278-0011 THEN HE CAST HIS NETS OVER A FAMILY OF FATHER MOTHER OR DAUGHTERS ONE OF WHOM HE PROPOSED TO MARRY
2506-11278-0012 ONE DAY THE TRADER FLED WITH HER TEAPOT AND A BASKETFUL OF COLD VICTUALS
2506-11278-0013 IT WAS A WRIGHT HONOURABLE WHICH BAITED THE HOOK WHICH GORGED ALL THESE GREEDY SIMPLE SNOBS

2506-169427-0000 INTEREST HOWEVER STILL RUNS ON IN BOTH CASES THE PERIODICAL OR ACCIDENTAL PAYMENT OF IT JUST SERVING TO KEEP THE MEMORY OF THE AFFAIR ALIVE TILL AT LENGTH IN SOME EVIL HOUR POP COMES A CREDITOR UPON EACH AND BY DEMANDING PRINCIPLES UPON THE SPOT TOGETHER WITH FULL INTEREST TO THIS VERY DAY MAKES THEM BOTH FEEL THE FULL EXTENT OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS
2506-169427-0001 AS THE READER FOR I HATE YOUR RIVETS HAS A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE I NEED NOT SAY MORE TO SATISFY HIM THAT MY HERO COULD NOT GO ON AT THIS RATE WITHOUT SOME SLIGHT EXPERIENCE OF THESE INCIDENTAL MEMENTOES
2506-169427-0002 TO SPEAK THE TRUTH HE HAD WANTONLY INVOLVED HIMSELF IN A MULTITUDE OF SMALL BOOK DEBTS OF THIS STAMP WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING EUGENIA'S FREQUENT ADVICE HE TOO MUCH DISREGARDED THINKING THAT AS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS CONTRACTED THROUGH ANY MALIGNANCY BUT ON THE CONTRARY FROM AN HONESTY OF MIND AND A MERE JOCUNDITY OF HUMOR THEY WOULD ALL OF THEM BE CROSSED OUT IN COURSE
2506-169427-0003 EUGENIUS WOULD NEVER ADMIT THIS AND WOULD OFTEN TELL HIM THAT ONE DAY OR OTHER HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE RECKONED WITH AND HE WOULD ALSO ADD IN AN ACCENT OF SORROWFUL APPREHENSION TO THE UTTERMOST MIGHT
2506-169427-0004 WHAT INCLINED EUGENIUS TO THE SAME OPINION WAS AS FOLLOW
2506-169427-0005 YORICK FOLLOWED EUGENUS WITH HIS EYES TO THE DOOR HE THEN CLOSED THEM BUT NEVER OPENED THEM MORE
2506-169427-0006 ALAS POOR YOICK
3660-172182-0000 NOW THIS IS HOW ARTHUR HUNTED THAT STAG
3660-172182-0001 AND THE LAST DOG THAT WAS LET LOOSE WAS THE FAVOURITE DOG OF ARTHUR CAVALAL WAS HIS NAME
3660-172182-0002 THEN THEY SOUNDED THE DEATH HORN FOR SLAYING AND WE ALL GATHERED ROUND
3660-172182-0003 ONE WISHES THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE LADY BEST BELOVED BY HIM AND ANOTHER TO THE LADY WHOM HE LOVED BEST
3660-172182-0004 AND AFTER MID DAY THEY BEHELD AN UNSHAPELY LITTLE MAN UPON A HORSE AND AFTER HIM A DAME OR A DAMOSEL ALSO ON HORSEBACK AND AFTER HER A KNIGHT OF LARGE STATURE BOWED DOWN AND HANGING HIS HEAD LOW AND SORROWFULLY AND CLAD IN BROKEN AND WORTHLESS ARMOUR
3660-172182-0005 I KNOW NOT WHO THEY ARE SAID HE BUT I KNOW SAID GUENEVER THIS IS THE KNIGHT WHOM CERAINE PURSUED AND METHINKS THAT HE COMES NOT HERE BY HIS OWN FREE WILL
3660-172182-0006 BUT DURRANT HAS UNDERTAKEN HIM AND AVENGED THE INSULT TO THE MAIDEN TO THE UTTERMOST
3660-172182-0007 LADY SAID HE AT THE GATE THERE WAS A KNIGHT AND I SAW NOT A MAN OF SO PITIFUL AN ASPECT TO LOOK UPON AS HE
3660-172182-0008 I DO SAID HE HE TELLS ME THAT HE IS EIRIN THE SON OF NUD
3660-172182-0009 THEN SHE RETURNED I KNOW HIM NOT
3660-172182-0010 SO GUENEVER CAME TO THE GATE TO MEET HIM AND HE ENTERED
3660-172182-0011 AND DURRANT GREETS THEE WELL AND IN GREETING THEE HE COMPELLED ME TO COME HITHER TO DO THY PLEASURE FOR THE INSULT WHICH THY MAIDEN RECEIVED FROM THE DWARF AND WHERE DID HE OVERTAKE THEE
3660-172182-0012 SIR SAID SHE WHEN THINKEST THOU THAT DURRANT WOULD BE HERE
3660-172182-0013 TO MORROW LADY I SEE YOU WILL BE HERE WITH THE MAIDEN
3660-172182-0014 I AM LORD SAID HE AND I HAVE MET WITH MUCH TROUBLE AND REPEATED WOUNDS UNSUPPORTABLE
3660-172182-0015 WELL SAID ARTHUR FROM WHAT I HEAR IT BEHOVES GAWENEVER TO BE MERCIFUL TOWARDS THEE
3660-172182-0016 THE MERCY WHICH THOU DESIREST LORD SAID SHE WILL I GRANTED TO HIM SINCE IT IS AS INSULTING TO THEE THAT AN INSULT SHOULD BE OFFERED TO ME AS TO THYSELF
3660-172182-0017 THUS WILL IT BE BEST TO LOSE SAID ARTHUR LET THIS MAN HAVE MEDICAL CARE UNTIL IT BE KNOWN WHETHER HE MAY LIVE
3660-172182-0018 TO GWENEVER AND HER HANDMAIDS SAID HE
3660-172182-0019 AND THE STEWARD OF HIS HOUSEHOLD SO ORDERED HER
3660-172182-0020 AND BEING YOUNG HE CHANGED HIMSELF AND GREW TO HATE THE SIN THAT SEEMED SO LIKE HIS OWN OF MODRED ATHA'S NEPHEW AND FELL AT LAST IN A GREAT BATTLE FIGHTING FOR THE KING
3660-172182-0021 AND WHEN GERRANT CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE GUENEVER WAS HE SALUTED HER
3660-172182-0022 THERE THEY WENT IN AND DISMOUNTED

3660-172182-0028 AN HE GREETS THEE WELL AS AN UNCLE SHOULD GREET HIS NEPHEW AND AS A VASSAL SHOULD GREET HIS LORD
3660-172182-0029 AND THE NEIGHBORING CHIEFS KNOWING THIS GROW INSOLENT TO HIM AND COVERT HIS LAND AND POSSESSIONS
3660-172182-0030 AND ARTHUR TOLD DURRANT THE CAUSE OF THE MISSION AND OF THE COMING OF THE AMBASSADORS TO HIM OUT OF CORNWALL TRULY SAID DURRANT BE IT TO MY ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE LORD I WILL DO ACCORDING TO THY WILL CONCERNING THE EMBASSY

3660-172182-0035 AND ANYONE ASKED THAT WHICH HE DESIRED
3660-172182-0036 AND THEY WERE NOT LONG IN SPEAKING SO EAGER WAS EVERY ONE TO BESTOW GIFTS AND OF THOSE WHO CAME TO ASK GIFTS NONE DEPARTED UNSATISFIED
3660-172182-0037 THEN CERAINE SENT EMBASSES TO THE MEN OF CORNWALL TO ASK THEM MISS
3660-172182-0038 AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WOULD BE THE FULLNESS OF JOY AND HONOR TO THEM FOR DURIN TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR HOMAGE

3660-172183-0001 BEFORE ARRAINT THE SCOURGE OF THE ENEMY I SAW STEEDS WHITE WITH FOAM AND AFTER THE SHOUT OF BATTLE A FEARFUL TORRENT
3660-172183-0002 THESE TIDINGS CAME TO RIBAN
3660-172183-0003 NOW I BY MY CONFESSION UNTO HEAVEN SAID SHE THERE IS NOTHING MORE HATEFUL UNTO ME THAN THIS
3660-172183-0004 AND THE TEARS AS SHE SAID AND THE WORDS SHE HAD SPOKEN AWOKE HIM
3660-172183-0005 AND EVIL BETIDE ME SAID HE IF THOU RETURNEST THERE UNTIL THOU KNOWEST WHETHER I HAVE LOST MY STRENGTH SO COMPLETELY AS THOU DIDST SAY

3660-172183-0011 AND WHILST I SPEAK UNTO THEE SAY NOT THOU ONE WORD EITHER
3660-172183-0012 AND THOUGH THOU SHOULDST DESIRE TO SEE MY DEFEAT AND MY DEATH BY THE HANDS OF MY MEN YET DO I FEEL NO DREAD
3660-172183-0013 AND HE REFUSED HIM AND THAT NOT FEEBLY
3660-172183-0014 YOU SAY NOT ONE WORD UNTO ME UNLESS I SPEAK FIRST UNTO THEE
3660-172183-0015 I WILL DO IT AS FAR AS I CAN LORD SAID SHE ACCORDING TO THY DESIRE

3660-172183-0019 THEN THEY LEFT THE WOOD AND THEY CAME TO AN OPEN COUNTRY WITH MEADOWS ON ONE HAND AND MOES MOWING THE MEADOWS
3660-172183-0020 MY LORD HE UTTERED WILL IT BE DISPLEASING TO THEE IF I ASK WHENCE THOU COMEST ALSO

3660-172183-0022 WHAT SORT OF MEAL HE ANSWERED

3660-172183-0025 I WILL DO LORD SAID SHE AS THOU SAIDEST
3660-172183-0026 AND AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRANK KARAINE WENT TO SLEEP AND SO DID ENID ALSO
3660-6517-0000 THE DATES SEEM UNIMPORTANT BUT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THE OFFICERS AND MAN OF THE SHIP HAVE BEEN UNREMITTINGLY BUSY
3660-6517-0001 BOWERS ATTACKED THE SHIP'S STORES SURVEYED RELLISTED AND RESTOWED THEM SAVING VERY MUCH SPACE BY UNSTOWING NUMEROUS CASES AND STOWING THE CONTENTS IN THE LAZARETTE
3660-6517-0002 WITHOUT STEAM THE LEAK CAN NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH THE HAND PUMP BY TWO DAILY EFFORTS OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AT TWENTY MINUTES
3660-6517-0003 AS THE SHIP WAS AND IN OUR PRESENT HEAVILY LADEN CONDITION IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE OR FOUR HOURS EACH DAY
3660-6517-0004 THE OLD GREEN TENT WAS PUT UP AND PROPER SUPPORTS MADE FOR IT
3660-6517-0005 THE ENGINEROOM STAFF ANDERSON'S PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOWING THEIR LABORATORIES THE COOK REFITTING HIS GALLEY AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD ITS BAND OF WORKERS
3660-6517-0006 THAT MAN'S SPACE SUCH AS IT IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FORE HATCH TO THE STEM ON THE MAIN DECK
3660-6517-0007 UNDER THE FORECASTLE ARE STALLS OF FIFTEEN PONIES THE MAXIMUM AND SPACE WOULD HOLD THE NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT IS PACKED TIGHT WITH FODDER
3660-6517-0008 IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FORECASTLE BULKADE IS THE SMALL BOOBY HATCH THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE MEN'S MESS DECK IN BAD WEATHER
3660-6517-0009 ABAFT THE FORE HATCH IS THE BASE HOUSE
3660-6517-0010 WE MANAGE TO GET THREE TONS OF ICE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO CARCASES OF MUTTON AND THREE CAUCASES OF BEEF BESIDES SOME BOXES OF SWEETBREADS AND KIDNEYS INTO THIS SPACE
3660-6517-0011 THE SACKS CONTAINING THIS LAST ADDED TO THE GOODS ALREADY MENTIONED MAKE A REALLY HEAVY DECK CARGO AND ONE IS NATURALLY ANXIOUS CONCERNING IT BUT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE FOR LASHING AND SECURING HAS BEEN DONE
3660-6517-0012 FORAGE I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIRTEEN TONS OF COMPRESSED OAT AND HAY FROM MELBOURNE
3660-6517-0013 THE SCENE IS WHOLLY ENCHANTING AND SUCH A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER IN A GARDEN WHICH BLAZES WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION IN ALL THINGS
3660-6517-0014 A GREAT MASS OF MEN ASSEMBLED
3660-6517-0015 KAY AND I LUNCH WITH A PARTY IN THE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY'S SHIP RUPOHOO
3660-6517-0016 TELEGRAM TO SAY TERRANOVA HAS ARRIVED SUNDAY NIGHT
3660-6517-0017 A THIRD SLEDGE STANDS ACROSS THE BREAK OF THE POOP IN THE SPACE HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY THE AFTER ONECH
3660-6517-0018 THE QUANTITY IS TWO AND A HALF TONS AND THE SPACE OCCUPIED CONCERNING
3660-6517-0019 THE SHIP WAS OVER TWO FEET UNDER THE STERN BUT THIS WILL SOON BE REMEDIED
3660-6517-0020 THEY MUST PERFORCE BE TRAINED UP AND THEY ARE GIVEN WHAT SHELTER IS AFFORDED ON DECK BUT THEIR POSITION IS NOT ENVIABLE
3660-6517-0021 IT IS THE PATHETIC ATTITUDE DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY OCCASIONALLY SOME POOR BEASTS EMITS A LONG PATHETIC WHINE
3660-6517-0022 THERE ARE USUALLY ONE OR TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASES MATTERS BUT IT IS A SQUASH
3660-6517-0023 LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND HAS VEERED TO THE WESTWARD HEADING US GENTLY
3660-6517-0024 OATES AND ATKINSON WITH INTERMITTENT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHERS WERE BUSY KEEPING THE PONIES IN THEIR LEGS
3660-6517-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EVIL AND NEARLY ALL HANDS WERE LABORING FOR HOURS IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP HEAVING COAL SACKS OVERBOARD AND RELARSHING THE PETROL CASES ET CETERA IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
3660-6517-0026 NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED THAN SOME ACCIDENTALLY HEAVY WAVE WOULD TEAR AWAY THE LASHING AND THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN
3660-6517-0027 FROM THE MOMENT ABOUT FOUR A M THE ENGINE ROOM BECAME THE CENTER OF INTEREST
3660-6517-0028 THE WATER JOINED IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT
3660-6517-0029 THE OUTLOOK APPEAR GRIM
3660-6517-0030 THE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH WAS BEING MADE WITH THE SHIPS SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS MOST IMPORTANT
3660-6517-0031 WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW FIRE ON WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
3660-6517-0032 THE BILG PUMP IS DEPENDENT ON THE MAIN ENGINE
3660-6517-0033 ON ONE OCCASION I WAS WAIST DEEP WHEN STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THE HOOP
3660-6517-0034 THE AFTERGUARD WERE ORGANIZED IN TWO PARTIES BY EVANS TO WORK BUCKETS THE MEN WERE KEPT STEADILY GOING ON THE CHOKED HAND PUMPS THIS SEEMED ALL THAT COULD BE DONE FOR A MOMENT AND WHAT A MEASURE TO COUNT AS THE SOLE SAFEGUARD OF THE SHIP FROM SINKING PRACTICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BAIL HER OUT
3660-6517-0035 OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD BEAR ONE OF THEM AWAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED BY HIS CHANNEL
3663-172005-0000 THE FAWN HAD TAKEN THIS MORNING AND NOW LAY CURLED UP ON A BED OF MOSS
3663-172005-0001 WHENEVER THE PAWN CAUGHT UP HE WAS QUITE CONTENT TO FRISK ABOUT
3663-172005-0002 THE DANGER WAS CERTAIN NOW THAT WAS NEAR
3663-172005-0003 THE HOUNDS HAD STRUCK A TRAIL WHERE SHE TURNED AND THE FAUN WAS SAFE
3663-172005-0004 ONE WAS ROWING THE OTHER HAD A GUN IN HIS HAND WHAT WOULD SHE DO
3663-172005-0005 HER TIRED LEGS COULD NOT REPEL THE TIRED BODY RAPIDLY
3663-172005-0006 THE DOE SAW THE BOAT NEARING IT
3663-172005-0007 IN A MOMENT MORE THE BOAT WAS ON HER AND THE MEN AT THE OARS AND LEANED OVER AND CAUGHT HER
3663-172528-0000 I WAS TORMENTED BY THIRST BUT WOULD ABSTAINED FROM DRINKING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS
3663-172528-0001 THAT OLD MAN CEASED TO GET SO MUCH ANNOYANCE YET SOMETIMES HE APPEARED TO ME IN DREAMS
3663-172528-0002 FELICIA GIVEN THEM ORDERS NOT TO SPEAK TO ME OF
3663-172528-0003 THIS MAN HAD STOLEN FROM ME CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND IN HER FEAR OF BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD DIED
3663-172528-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE ALLOWED ME QUIETLY TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FULL I THEN COVERED MYSELF AND BEGAN TO SWEAT AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
3663-172528-0005 THEY SAY THAT MY DEAR FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO GRIEVED WAS HE TO HEAR THIS
3663-172528-0006 AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY STATE AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE SERVING GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT SHOUTING OUT AH TRAITRESS YOU HAD KILLED HIM FOR ME THEN
3663-172528-0007 SHE MAY INDEED HAVE SAVED MY LIFE SO SEND ME A HELPING HAND FOR I HAVE SWEATED AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT
3663-172528-0008 FELICIA RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS DRIED AND MADE ME COMFORTABLE AND I BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN MY STATE BEGAN TO RECKON ON RECOVERY
3663-172528-0009 JUST THEN THE OTHER MISTER BERNARDINO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAD REFUSED TO BLEED ME
3663-172528-0010 MAESTRO FRANCESCO THAT MOST AMIABLE MAN EXCLAIMED OH POWER OF NATURE
3663-172528-0011 HE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE PHYSICIANS KNOW NOTHING
3663-172528-0012 THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER SAID IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED UPON THE SPOT
3663-172528-0013 AFTERWARDS THEY TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER
3663-172528-0014 I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED YOUR THIRST
3663-172528-0015 IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THAT POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED HER TO BLEED HIM
3663-172528-0016 IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DIDN YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE
3663-172528-0017 YOU COULD THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HIS CURE
3663-172528-0018 AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUAKER SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN
3663-172528-0019 THAT VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREATER PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD
3663-172528-0020 DO NOT COMMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME IN ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM
3663-172528-0021 THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO IS PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE
3663-172528-0022 SO I HAD MADE MY MIND UP AND PREPARED TO TRAVEL
3663-172528-0023 THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIERRE LANDES WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
3663-172528-0024 NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUT WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
3663-172528-0025 I HAD HARBOURED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN BUT THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS
3663-172528-0026 MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DE MONTEVERQUI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL
3663-172528-0027 THERE THEY CENTRED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY
3663-172528-0028 MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED ON THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE
3663-172528-0029 AT THESE WORDS MAESTRO AGOSTINO THE DUKE'S TAILOR MADE HIS WAY TO ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT
3663-172528-0030 GEORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MYASTHRO AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED THERE IS THAT MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NOT
3663-172528-0031 AS FIERCELY AS I COULD BUT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED GIORGIO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0032 HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO AND THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THIS SWORD
3663-172528-0033 MAESTRO AUGUSTINO RETORTED YOU GALLOWS SPIRIT
3663-172528-0034 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT FROM MOST CERTAIN
3663-172528-0035 GEORGIUS MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0036 THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND WE HALTED
3663-172528-0037 THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MARVELLED I WAS STILL ALIVE OTHERWISE HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH
3663-172528-0038 WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTERA GUTTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME
3663-172528-0039 I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND TOLD HIM ALL THE AFFAIR ABOUT THE PINT
3663-172528-0040 HE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE THEIR VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT
3663-172528-0041 I THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIETRO PAGOLO ADVICE ABOUT STAMPING THE COINS AND THEN WENT OFF UPON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE POPE OR ANYBODY ELSE
3663-172528-0042 DO YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALIZE THAT FEROCIOUS TYRANT
3663-172528-0043 YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOES AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS
3663-172528-0044 IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENTS
3663-172528-0045 MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DYES OF THAT MEDAL
3663-172528-0046 I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WILL TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE
3663-172528-0047 I THEN SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENCIO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL
3663-172528-0048 NICCOLO DA MONTERE GUTTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENCHINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
3663-172528-0049 NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAVE FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
3663-172528-0050 I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORTH TO MY BEST ABILITY
3663-172528-0051 THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOR THEY USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED
3663-172528-0052 I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND IN A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL
3663-172528-0053 I NOW USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING
3663-172528-0054 I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR GAME
3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIRE
3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I SHOULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE
3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADE'S THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF CUANA
3915-57461-0003 HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THOSE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED
3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM A DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM
3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THIS THE ROAN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE IS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPEN TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
3915-57461-0006 NOW ALAS IN THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE
3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT THEM
3915-57461-0008 THEN THAT ROANON SAID TO THE BOATMAN
3915-57461-0009 WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAITORS
3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONDA HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONON OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOSTO
3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVORING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED THE WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD
3915-57461-0013 SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME IT HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF
3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN COULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR
3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TOKOBAY FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERY MISERY THE WONDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME
3915-57461-0016 HOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET
3915-57461-0017 AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THEIR COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER
3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO AT THE CUANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL REMEMBER IT
3915-57461-0019 HAPLY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WALKING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART
3915-57461-0020 ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF MY MARVELLOUS AILMENT
3915-57461-0021 THINKING I COULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND THAT I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
3915-57461-0022 AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME HIM TO BEAR MALICE
3915-57461-0023 REPENT NOT THEREFORE AND ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAYS
3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU DIE SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS
3915-57461-0025 BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU SHALL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TORMENT YOU
3915-57461-0026 IN A FIT OF MADNESS HE WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROB YOU
3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOMEDAY OVERTAKE ME
3915-57461-0028 HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD HER SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL
3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND ARE ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
3915-57461-0030 A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WINDS OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT
3915-98647-0000 EVERY WELL ORDERED JAPANESE HOME OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTER OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THAT HOUSE
3915-98647-0001 SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY OR ANNIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS
3915-98647-0002 THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHERS AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE
3915-98647-0003 VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT ON ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION
3915-98647-0004 ALL THESE WERE PUT TOGETHER BY THE POWERFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT THE CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SON
3915-98647-0005 AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES FALL OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE
3915-98647-0006 EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILLED BALANCER OF PROSE AND KHANS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE
3915-98647-0007 FOR THE GREATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE THE HOME PROPHECIES ARE THOUGHT TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN AND THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED IN
3915-98647-0008 NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHICH DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR
3915-98647-0009 AFTER THIS MANNER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE AS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS
3915-98647-0010 OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS THE DAY WHEN THE ROOF IS RAISED
3915-98647-0011 THE HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY A BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
3915-98647-0012 A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABOURERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGEPOLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SCRAMBLED JOYFULLY
3915-98647-0013 ALL COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CANNOT COME SEND THEIR SERVANTS OR PROVISIONS
3915-98647-0014 ON THE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN A CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS A STILL COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN
3915-98647-0015 NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES THAT SURVIVAL OF AN OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE
3915-98647-0016 AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE AT THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE
3915-98647-0017 THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES WHICH ATTEND THE FUNERAL
3915-98647-0018 UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL THOSE LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS
3915-98647-0019 WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IT IS DRESSED IN WHITE AND SILK HABA TIE WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT
3915-98647-0020 THE BODY TOO BEING PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS
3915-98647-0021 THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THAT COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THAT THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD
3915-98647-0022 THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METHOD IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEED THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH
3915-98647-0023 LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF CHEESE
3915-98647-0024 SO LONG AS THE COFFIN IS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE PASSED OVER CONTINUALLY
3915-98647-0025 IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFIN IS NOT ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES
3915-98647-0026 THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE HEART THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY
3915-98647-0027 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THIS CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED
3915-98647-0028 A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUKKISWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING
3915-98647-0029 IN HIS WILL HE BELIEVED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING IN THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED
3915-98647-0030 TO THIS GROWING FEELING AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES
3915-98647-0031 JUST BEFORE THIS PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY
3915-98647-0032 ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEATH EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT
3915-98647-0033 SOMETIMES WITH A GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS ON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN
3915-98647-0034 ANOTHER FAVORITE VISITOR AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON
3915-98647-0035 IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURY
3915-98647-0036 DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE AND A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET UP IN A DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY
4153-185072-0000 HE TARRIED AT KENESHAW A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP TO GAADO WHERE I THEN RESIDED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE WINTER CAME ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS STAY
4153-185072-0001 THE ENRAGED HUSBAND WELL KNOWING THAT HE SHOULD FEEL A BLOW IF HE WAITED TO HEAR THE ORDER APPOINTED INSTANTLY RETREATED AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS CATTLE
4153-185072-0002 WE PROTECTED THE POOR NANTICOKE WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUALS AND ALLAN SYMPATHISED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES TILL SPRING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE PROMISED A REFORMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OF RENEWAL OF HER AFFECTIONS
4153-185072-0003 THE INDIANS WERE ALSO ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN OFFICER THAT THE WAMPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS ARDENTLY WISHED FOR
4153-185072-0004 MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ALAN'S HORSE AND CARRIED THEIR GOODS
4153-185072-0005 ALLEYNE ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE AND OF HIS RETURN THEY WERE SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTLES WHO MARRIED PRISCILLA RAMSAY WITH A SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM
4153-185072-0006 NETTLES AT LENGTH ABANDONED THE CHASE WENT HOME AND ALIGHTNE ALL IN TATTERS CAME IN
4153-185072-0007 BUT RUNNING IN THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO RAGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SUFFERING CONDITION ALMOST NAKED
4153-185072-0008 ALLEYNE MADE HIS TROUSERS HIMSELF AND THEN BUILT A RAFT ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MONTMORE
4153-185072-0009 THERE AN INDIAN GAVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENTS AND A GOOD GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE BEARDSTOWN WHERE HE FOUND HIS SQUAW
4153-185072-0010 NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF IN THAT PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GARDO
4153-185072-0011 THE LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SWIFTNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE INTO HIS FORMER CASTLE OF SAFETY
4153-185072-0012 HIS PURSUERS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETED AND UNDER OUR PROTECTION
4153-185072-0013 STILL UNSATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THEY ADVISED MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME THE SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDERED OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT TO MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF HIS SITUATION AND PRESENTLY THEY LEFT ME
4153-185072-0014 HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOKE ME WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION FEARING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
4153-185072-0015 AT THE TIME ALAN LAY IN A SECRET PLACE IN THE GULF A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FLATS IN A HOLE THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER
4153-186222-0000 THERE'S LITTLE DANGER IN THIS QUARTER I AM SURE SO I MAY AS WELL BE FRIENDS WITH A POOR CHILD
4153-186222-0001 NOW WHY NOT
4153-186222-0002 BETH HASTILY
4153-186222-0003 THE LETTER ASKING ME TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE YOU ASKED ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FRIENDLY AND SO I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
4153-186222-0005 SURELY TWO GIRLS WILL HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS LONELY OLD PLACE THAN ONE COULD BE ALONE
4153-186222-0006 OH YES SHE SAYS CORRECTED LOUISE
4153-186222-0007 YE MEAN PATRICIA DOYLE YES
4153-186222-0008 THAT WE MAY CONCLUDE SHE'S LEFT OUT OF THE ARRANGEMENT SAID BETH CALMLY
4153-186222-0009 YOU'LL FIGHT FER YOUR OWN CHANCE AND FIGHT MIGHTY HARD
4153-186222-0010 WHY MY DEAR FELLOW I DON'T WANT AUNT JANE'S MONEY
4153-186222-0011 MY MOTHER AND I WERE AMPLY PROVIDED FOR AND I AM ONLY HERE TO FIND REST FROM MY SOCIAL DUTIES AND TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH MY DEAD FATHER'S SISTER THAT IS ALL
4153-186222-0012 MY FATHER TEACHES MUSICK AND MOTHER SCOLDS HIM CONTINUALLY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT
4153-186222-0013 WE'VE NEVER SEEN A CENT OF HER MONEY ALTHOUGH FATHER HAS TRIED TO BORROW ENOUGH TO HELP HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
4153-186222-0014 I EVEN KISSED HER WHEN SHE ASKED ME TO AND THIS SENT A SHIVER ALL DOWN MY BACK
4153-186222-0015 FOR MY PART I'M FOND OF EVERYONE AND IT DELIGHTS ME TO FUSS AROUND INVALIDS AND ASSIST THEM
4153-186222-0016 YOU SAY YOU'D LIKE TO CARE FOR IN WILLIDS AND I DON'T
4153-186222-0017 YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME THINK YOU DON'T WANT ELMHURST WHEN YOU'RE AS ANXIOUS TO GET THERE AS I AM
4153-186222-0018 THEY CALL ME BETH SULLENNESS
4153-186222-0019 I COULDN'T LIVE IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE WORLD YOU SEE
4153-186222-0020 BUT SUPPOSE SHE LEAVES IT TO ME PERSISTED BET
4153-186222-0021 THEY SEEMED TO MEDITATE
4153-186222-0022 IT'S A MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID BETH LOOKING AT THE COUSIN DOUBTFULLY
4153-186222-0023 NOW SHALL WE BE FRIENDS I ASKED LIGHTLY
4153-186222-0024 TO BE SURE THAT I SHOULD WANT YOU TO MY DEAR
4153-186222-0025 SUCH A GIRL FRIEND IT HAD NEVER BEEN HER PRIVILEGE TO HAVE BEFORE AND WHEN HER SUSPICIONS WERE FORGOTTEN SHE BECAME VERY RESPONSIVE AND BRIGHTENED WONDERFULLY
4153-186222-0026 SILAS SHE SAID WHEN HE ENTERED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY BEASTS
4153-186222-0027 THEY ARE VERY CHARMING GIRLS SHE ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THEY ARE AT AN AGE WHEN FEW GIRLS SHOW TO GOOD ADVANTAGE
4153-186222-0028 WHY DID YOU NOT INVITE KENNETH TO DINNER JANE THE BOYS
4153-186222-0029 HE HAS CONSTANTLY SAYING DISAGREEABLE THINGS
4153-186222-0030 VERY WELL SAID THE LAWYER QUIETLY WHICH OF MY NIECES DO YOU PROPOSE
4153-186222-0031 ASKED THE OLD LADIES AFTER A PAUSE I CANNOT SAY ON SO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE HE ANSWERED WITH GRAVITY WHICH DO YOU PREFER JANE
4153-186222-0032 THEY ARE EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY SHE SAID
4153-186222-0033 I CANNOT IMAGINE ELMHURST BELONGING TO EITHER SILAS OR
4153-186222-0034 I MUST SEE THAT LITTLE NIECE THE ONE WHO DEFIES ME AND REFUSES TO ANSWER MY SECOND LETTER
4153-186222-0035 THERE WOULD BE A DOZEN BEARS TO FIGHT FOR MY MONEY AND DEAR OLD ELMHURST WOULD BE SOLD TO STRANGERS SHE RESUMED WITH BITTERNESS
4153-186223-0000 IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE ROOM KENNETH FORBES SQUATTED UPON A BENCH WITH AN EMPTY PIN BOX HELD CARELESSLY IN HIS LAP
4153-186223-0001 WHILE DUNCAN LOOKED THE BOY WAS BUSY WITH HIS PENCIL BUT NEITHER HAD SPOKEN FOR AT LEAST A HALF HOUR
4153-186223-0002 THEN WRITING SLOWLY UP THE HEDGE BORDERED ROAD HIS TROUBLES ONCE MORE ASSAILED HIM AND HE WONDERED IF THERE WAS NOT SOME SPOT UPON THE BROAD EARTH TO WHICH HE COULD FLY FOR RETIREMENT UNTIL THE GIRLS HAD LEFT ELMHURST FOR GOOD
4153-186223-0003 NOWAH SHIED AND HE LOOKED UP TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAD NEARLY RUN DOWN A PEDESTRIAN A STOUT LITTLE MAN WITH A BUNDLE UNDER HIS ARM WHO HELD UP ONE HAND AS IF TO ARREST HIM
4153-186223-0004 WHERE ARE YOU WANT TO GO ASKED THE BOY
4153-186223-0005 THEN IT'S THE SAME TRAIN AS EVER HE RESPONDED WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
4153-186223-0006 DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT OF COURSE SHE'D REFORMED AND I'D BE GLAD TO SEE HER AGAIN THEY TELL ME SHE'S GOT MONEY
4153-186223-0007 AUNT JANE'S RICH AUNT JOHN
4153-186223-0008 ECHOED THE MEN QUICKLY WHAT YOU NAME LAD
4153-186223-0009 DON'T LIKE GIRLS I GIVE IT
4153-186223-0010 ANOTHER LONG PAUSE THEN THE BOY SUDDENLY TURNED QUESTIONABLE
4153-186223-0011 YOU KNOW UNCLE MISS MERRICK SIR
4153-186223-0012 I USE TO WHEN WE WERE BOTH YOUNGER
4153-186223-0013 KENNETH STOPPED SHORT AND THE MAYOR STOPPED AND THE LITTLE MAN WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE AT THE GIRL'S ASTONISHMENT ALSO STOPPED
4153-186223-0014 JOHN MERRICK THAT'S MY
4153-186223-0015 YOU LIKE THE TINSMITH
4153-186223-0016 THEY KEPT TRACK OF HER BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY BECAME RICH AND A GREAT LADY AND THAT WAS A SURPRISING THING TO HAPPEN TO A MERRIK
4153-186223-0017 THANK YOU LAD RETURNED THE MAN GRATEFULLY I THOUGHT A LITTLE EXERCISE WOULD DO ME GOOD BUT THIS THREE MINUTES HAS SEEMED LIKE THIRTY TO ME
4153-186223-0018 YOU WILL SAID THE MAN
4153-186223-0019 THE BOY TURNED AWAY BUT IN THAT MOMENT HALTED AGAIN
4153-186223-0020 HIS INTEREST IN MISS JANE'S DAUGHTER JOHN WAS EXTRAORDINARY
4153-61735-0000 THEY ARE BUT LUKEWARM LOVERS WHO CAN CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH A DIALOGUE CARRIED ON AT BEAUSTROT DISTANCE
4153-61735-0001 IF THERE BE AN ELYSIAN ON EARTH IT IS THIS
4153-61735-0002 HIS OWN DAUGHTER HIS ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE BEST BLOOD OF SOUTHERN ARISTOCRACY BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING TO SECURE HIM A SPLENDID ALLIANCE HOLDING LIGHTLY ASSIGNATION WITH A HORSE HUNTER
4153-61735-0003 HE COULD WELL CONCEDE SO MUCH TO HER CAPRICE SINCE HER STAYING AT HOME COULD BE NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE CAUSE THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO THE STERN COURSE
4153-61735-0004 IT IS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THIS ROAD PASSED THE HACIENDA OF CASA DEL CORVO AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THAT HOUSE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER
4153-61735-0005 ON REACHING THE COPSE HE DISMOUNTED LED HIS HORSE IN AMONG THE UNDERWOOD HITCHED HIM BY LOOPING HIS BRIDLE REIN ROUND THE TOPMOST TWIGS OF AN ELASTIC BOW THEN DETACHING A LONG ROPE OF TWISTED HORSEHAIR FROM THE HORN OF HIS SADDLE AND INSERTING HIS ARM INTO ITS COIL HE GLIDED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND ON THE SIDE THAT LAY TOWARDS THE HACIENDA
4153-61735-0006 BEFORE FORSAKING THE SHADOW OF THE CORPSE HE CAST A GLANCE TOWARD THE SKY AND AT THE MOON SAILING SUPREMELY ABOVE IT
4153-61735-0007 THE DROLL CONCEIT WHICH HAS SO OFT AMUSED THE NOCTURNAL INEBRIATE OF GREAT CITIES APPEARED TO PRODUCE A LIKE EFFECT UPON THE NIGHT PATROLLERS OF THE PRAIRIE AND FOR A MOMENT THE SHADOW LATE DARKENING HIS BROW DISAPPEARED
4153-61735-0008 IT'S NOT LIKELY IT IS ARE UNLESS IT BE THE OWNER OF A BAD CONSCIENCE WHO CAN'T SLEEP
4153-61735-0009 TROTH THERE'S ONE SUCH BETWEEN THOSE WALLS
4153-61735-0010 IF HE BE ABROAD THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF HIS SEEING ME ON THE OPEN GROUND NOR THAT I SHOULD CARE A STRAW IF IT WERE ONLY MYSELF TO BE COMPROMISED
4153-61735-0011 IT'S NO USE WAITING UPON THE MOON DEUCED TORE
4153-61735-0012 IT IS TRUE HE HAD DESIGNS ON THE HACIENDA BUT THESE DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EITHER ITS CASH PLATE OR JEWELLERY IF WE EXCEPT THE MOST PRECIOUS JEWEL IT CONTAINED THE MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HERSELF
4323-13259-0000 THE CHURCH BELLS WERE RINGING AND PEOPLE ON THE AVENUE GOING BY TO SERVICE TURNED CURIOUS INQUIRING LOOK UP AT THE GREAT HOUSE AND THEN WENT ON TALKING OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD SO STRANGELY ENTERED INTO AND MADE HISTORY IN THE CITY
4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSIONED APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR OF INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMOND HAD VOTED TO CHANGE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SALOON
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAYMOND STOOD CONFOUNDED BY THE RESULT
4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT IN RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULE
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM STRAIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 WHAT IF HE HAD BEGUN TO DO AS EDITH WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 WHEN WAS THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS
4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDISTURBED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY PUBLIC EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE CLOTHES THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WELLS OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER IN RAIMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIN FOREVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEETINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERISED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES AND IMPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON AND THE AWFUL CURSE
4323-13259-0013 JACK AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRERS WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO IN PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 GRAY HAD GONE UP TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER AND MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERALS SAID GREY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF HIS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LOREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 YOU WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS BRIDGE THINK BEST WILL BE RIGHT
4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DISPLAYS AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENT IN A NEIGHBORING CITY
4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES OF THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANYTHING I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER TO THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT A DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION WAS FULL OF SALOONS
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUEER PART OF THIS STRANGE SERVICES
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND AT THAT SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED
4323-13259-0026 THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY
4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWERS AND AFTER ONE OR TWO INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS PHRONSIE TURNED FEARFULLY AWAY
4323-18416-0001 I'LL TRY AN SHE LAID A QUICK HAND ON THE KNOB
4323-18416-0002 FOUR RED SPOTS BURNED ON HER CHEEKS AND HER PALE BLUE EYES SNAPPED
4323-18416-0003 I' AM SURE I HEARD IT RAGING UP AND DOWN
4323-18416-0004 I DON'T WANT NO DINNER SAID CHARLOTTE DRAWING BACK
4323-18416-0005 OH YES INDEED SAID POLLY CHEERILY JUST AS FINE AS CAN BE
4323-18416-0006 ASSUREDLY SAID OLD MISTER KING WITH GREAT SATISFACTION IN POLLY'S PLEASURE AND AT HIS SUCCESS IN DRAWING CHARLOTTE OUT
4323-18416-0007 AND AFTER THIS THERE WERE NO MORE QUITE DAYS FOR CHARLOTTE CHATTERTON
4323-18416-0008 OH BLESS ME IT'S YOU PHRONSIE IN PLEASED SURPRISES
4323-18416-0009 YES GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE COMING IN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR QUICKLY I CAME ON PURPOSE TO SEE YOU ALL ALONE
4323-18416-0010 SO YOU DID DEAR SAID MISTER KING HIGHLY GRATIFIED AND PUSHING ASIDE HIS WRITING TABLE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
4323-18416-0011 OH NO GRANDPAPA CRIED PHRONSIE IN A RAPTURE I COULD NEVER BE TOO BIG FOR THAT SO SHE PERCHED UP AS OF OLD UPON HIS KNEE THEN SHE FOLDED HER HANDS AND LOOKED GRAVELY IN HIS FACE
4323-18416-0012 BUT MY DEAR WHAT IS IT
4323-18416-0013 ASKED THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN PRESENTLY YOU'VE COME TO TELL ME SOMETHING I SUPPOSE
4323-18416-0014 YES GRANDPAPA I HAVE SAID PHRONSIE DECIDEDLY AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TOO GRANDPAPA AND OH I DO WISH IT SO MUCH AND SHE CLASPED HER HANDS TIGHTER AND SIGHED
4323-18416-0015 WELL THEN PHRONSIE IF YOU WANT IT I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE SAID MISTER COOK QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
4323-18416-0016 OH SHE LEFT YOU EVERYTHING SHE HAD PHRONSIE A COUPLE OF MILLIONS OR SO IT'S WHY

4323-18416-0019 GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE WASN'T MISSUS CHATTERTON ANNE TO CHARLOTTE
4323-18416-0020 IF MISSUS CHATTERTON WAS AUNT TO CHARLOTTE PERSISTED PHRONSIE SLOWLY IT SEEMS AS IF CHARLOTTE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF THAT MONEY IT REALLY DOES GRANDPAPA

4323-18416-0028 THERE THERE MY SISTER'S BOY SHALL NEVER SAY THAT BUT COME IN COME
4323-18416-0029 NOT TO BE UNGRACIOUS THE OLD MAN THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR
4323-18416-0030 OH HANGED UNCLE WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME ALONE
4323-18416-0031 AND WHICH IS A WONDER INTERPOLATED PICKERING

4323-18416-0033 FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE PICKERING CRIED HIS UNCLE DARTING IN FRONT OF THE CHAIR AND ITS RESTLESS OCCUPANT DON'T SAY THAT
4323-18416-0034 I'VE BEEN A LAZY DOG ALL MY LIFE AND GOOD FOR NOUGHT BUT I HOPE I HAVE NOT SUNK TO THAT
4323-55228-0000 AND NEXT MOMENT HE FELL BACK IN AMAZEMENT BEFORE THE IMPETUOUS RUSH OF A STARRY EYED FLUSHED CHEEKED YOUNG WOMAN WHO DEMANDED
4323-55228-0001 WHERE IS SHE PETE MISS BILLY GASPED THE OLD MAN
4323-55228-0002 AUNT HANNAH'S CHEEKS TOO WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES STARRY BUT WITH DISMAY AND ANGER AND LAST BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PETE HAD SAID MISS BILLY'S NAME
4323-55228-0003 IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY IS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO IT OF COURSE IT'S SHE
4323-55228-0004 RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE IS HE
4323-55228-0005 INTERPOSED BILLY TELL MISTER BERTRAM I AM HERE OR WAIT I'LL COME RIGHT IN AND SURPRISE HIM
4323-55228-0006 PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE TOWARDS AUNT HANAH
4323-55228-0007 MISS BILLY MISS MARY YOU'RE AN ANGEL STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN YOU ARE YOU ARE OH I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME
4323-55228-0008 IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT HE'S IN THE DEN SAID BILLY
4323-55228-0009 BILLY TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE SHE CAN TAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARD THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AUNT HANNAH'S INDIGNANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BILLY STOP
4323-55228-0010 PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETER'S LIPS TWITCHED
4323-55228-0011 BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN SHE SPOKE
4323-55228-0012 A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COACH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN
4323-55228-0013 DON KLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY
4323-55228-0014 IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GREY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK ON HILLSIDE
4323-55228-0015 THEN SO GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL
4323-55228-0016 AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE HAND THAT WAS USABLE
4323-55228-0017 WHY I OF COURSE STAMMERED BILLY I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU HAD FOUND OUT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
4323-55228-0018 DEMANDED BERTRAM ANGRY AND MYSTERIFIED
4323-55228-0019 AS FOR MY NOT PAINTING AGAIN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE DEARIES
4323-55228-0020 SHE PULLED HERSELF BACK AWAY FROM BERTRAM'S ENCIRCLING ARM
4323-55228-0021 MARY DREW A QUIVERING SIGH
4323-55228-0022 GOOD HEAVENS IS KATE IN THIS TWO BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS SAVAGE NOW
4323-55228-0023 YES SHE WROTE A LETTER
4323-55228-0024 BELLIE LAUGHED GAILY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES
4323-55228-0025 AND YOU NEVER DO THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM
4323-55228-0026 HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK A SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS
4323-55228-0027 BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THIS QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT'S
4323-55228-0028 AFTER A MOMENT BILLIE STIRRED AND SIGHED HAPPILY
4323-55228-0029 YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MAJOR ARKWRIGHT
4323-55228-0030 AND AND YOU DIDN'T CARE SPECIALLY TO FOR MISS WINTHROP
4323-55228-0031 BILLY PUT A SOFT FINGER ON HER LIPS
4323-55228-0032 BERTRAM KISSED THAT FINGER AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED
4323-55228-0033 BUT WHAT IS THAT IS THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY
4323-55228-0034 THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERTRAM STRUCK
4323-55228-0035 BILLY I' AM GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY
4323-55228-0036 I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT FOR THEN YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY
4323-55228-0037 I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW AND I'LL GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUND THAT LAW I FORGOT
4323-55228-0038 FIVE DAYS AGAIN SIR
4323-55228-0039 I WONDER IF YOU THINK I MAY GET READY TO BE MARRIED IN FIVE DAYS
4323-55228-0040 DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIA GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT
4323-55228-0041 IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE I
4323-55228-0042 BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAM CRAFTLY
4323-55228-0043 THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WAS NOT SLOW TO READ IT
4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS LITTLE LEFT ARM
4323-55228-0045 LADY MY DEAR
4323-55228-0046 IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE NEARER
4323-55228-0047 WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE ME
4323-55228-0048 AND YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE OCTOBER
4323-55228-0049 AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNDERSTANDINGLY
4323-55228-0050 YES NODDED KATY DEMURELY
4323-55228-0051 YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE SHUT IN BERTRAM MERRILY
4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO NIGHT BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW
4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG IS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MIGHT NOW FULFILL
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM VERY IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS CELLAR DAYS HE DALLIED WITH THE GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT
4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK THEY LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK
4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY THE MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT
4515-11057-0006 WE WROTE TO MARIAN
4515-11057-0007 WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME OR SEE ME
4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFINS AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THE DEUCE DOES HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
4515-11057-0010 I HAD HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
4515-11057-0011 POVERTY I CAN HARDLY SUPPOSE
4515-11057-0012 BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFF FOR A LONG TIME
4515-11057-0013 WAS THEY STILL SO VERY POOR
4515-11057-0014 HE ASKED AMY COMPASSIONATELY
4515-11057-0015 I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOT FAILED UTTERLY
4515-11057-0016 OR IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN HOPELESS LOVE
4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF A NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE EQUALLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
4515-11057-0020 AMYS MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN
4515-11057-0021 ESPECIALLY NOT THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
4515-11057-0022 IS IT SO
4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER YOULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
4515-11057-0024 OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO BRAVE THAT
4515-11057-0025 HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDENT
4515-11057-0026 I HAVE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE
4515-11057-0027 THIS WAS SILENCE
4515-11057-0028 THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MAKE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
4515-11057-0029 RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN WE FIRST KNEW ME
4515-11057-0030 BUT JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT
4515-11057-0031 YOU DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING FALLING OFF IN MY WORK RECENTLY
4515-11057-0032 DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE FRONT AND SO ON GENERALLY
4515-11057-0033 SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED IT WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
4515-11057-0034 THEIR STORY IN THAT GIRL'S PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
4515-11057-0035 AND I COULD SO EASILY HAVE PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
4515-11057-0036 I SURMISE AND THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
4515-11057-0037 DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE LIFTED
4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVORSABLE WHAT CAN I DO
4515-11057-0039 THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY HEALTH
4515-11057-0040 WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRUBBLING
4515-11057-0041 AGAIN JASPER HELD THE WHITE SOFT HEAD FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT
4515-11057-0042 YES FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY
4515-11057-0043 MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HIS COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HIS HEART
4515-11057-0045 HE CAME ABRUPTLY
4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN ANSWERED
4515-11057-0047 THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS IN THE BATTLE
4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN BUT
4515-11057-0049 YOU' ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER
4515-11057-0050 MORE OF THE BRUTE YE MEAN
4515-11057-0051 YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DONT
4515-11057-0052 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS SHE WENT ON PRESENTLY
4515-11057-0053 GUESS
4515-11057-0054 WILL YOU MARRY ME BUT LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE
4515-11057-0055 YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR BROTHER AT PRESENT
4515-11057-0056 I SHOULD NOT BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER
4515-11057-0057 THEN SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY
4515-11057-0058 DEAR I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAVE BECOME BLIND
4515-11057-0059 HAS THIS ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU
4515-11057-0060 WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE THE ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN
4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE
4515-11057-0062 SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND RESPECTED
4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER MY FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU WERE MY WIFE
4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT WILLIAM AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
4515-11057-0065 SAID JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT
4515-11057-0066 DO HE THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE
4515-11057-0067 THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THAT PLAIN TRUTH
4515-11057-0068 I DON'T TRUST TO MYSELF
4515-11057-0069 OR SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILLINGLY
4515-11057-0070 PUT UP OUR UMBRELLA MARIAN
4515-11057-0071 WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL MY LOVE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD WE SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME
4515-11057-0073 WHY NEED I CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0074 IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DESTROYED YOURSELF
4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN DIANA
4515-11057-0076 HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS
4515-11057-0077 I DO LOOK IT
4515-11057-0078 HER EMOTION HAD SOME EFFECT ON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED
4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER SOMETHING FOR HER PARENTS
4515-11057-0080 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE
4515-11057-0081 IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR OUR FATHER
4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIAN I CAN'T STAND THAT
4515-11057-0083 I MUST BE FAITHFUL TO YOU
4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER AND MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
4515-11057-0085 MOVING TO FALL HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING
4515-11057-0086 WITH WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS
4515-11057-0087 BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT DID SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
4515-11057-0088 YOU DIDN'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
4515-11057-0089 HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY SAINT
4515-11057-0090 AND IS IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
4515-11057-0091 FOR IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
4515-11057-0092 IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I CAN LOVE YOU
4515-11057-0093 WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO HIM MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW
4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS OURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO
4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND IF I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT
4515-11057-0096 WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTHS
4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMEN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT THEIR MEETING DURING THAT TIME
4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO ME A CHILDISH
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MYSTERY
4515-11057-0101 JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ALMOST CALMLY
4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THAT MUSEUM YES
4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING WILLIAM YOU CAN'T WORK
4515-11057-0104 I MUST AND WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
4515-11057-0105 GOOD BYE SHE GAVE HIM THE HAND
4515-11057-0106 THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKING QUICKLY AWAY
4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERER HUMILIATION
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HER TONES AND ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN OF WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
4515-11057-0110 YESTERDAY MORNING WE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY IT IS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOU ARE THE ONLY BROTHER I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE IT CAME A REPLY
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO YOUR TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF A PROBLEM
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT TO EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO THE GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM PUBLIC LIFE
4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT A LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THEIR VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF HIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTEE TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED A GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIERS AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USUAL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOR IT IS AS MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 BUT PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE FITTED TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT OF THE BIGGER HOUND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON OUR LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE IS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTER HOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BRED BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HARRIER AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBOROUGH HOUND WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
4570-14911-0008 THERE THEY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY
4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHASTONS THE HOWSTEAD PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HOLTONS THE LEE PARK THE STOKEPLACE THE CEDINBURGH THE SURBITON THE TRINITY FOOTE THE WOODDALE MISSUS G W HILLIARDS MISSUS PRICE'S AND MISSUS TURNER'S
4570-14911-0010 HER EYES BROWN DARK HAZEL OR HAZEL NOT DEEP SET NOR BULGY AND WITH A MILD EXPRESSION
4570-14911-0011 EARS LONG SET ON LOW FINE IN TEXTURE AND HANGING IN A GRACEFUL FOLD CLOSE TO THE CHECK
4570-14911-0012 NECK MODERATELY LONG SLIGHTLY ARCHED THE THROATS SHOWING SOME DEWLAP
4570-14911-0013 HER SHOULDERS CLEAN AND SLIGHTLY SLOPING

4831-25894-0033 LITTLE RONZO WAS RECEIVED WITH DELIGHT BY THE KIND LADY AND HER CHILDREN AND TESSA LEARNED THE SONG QUITE EASILY
4831-25894-0034 AROSE FROM THE CROWD OF CHILDREN GATHERED BY THE FESTIVAL
4831-25894-0035 BEFORE THEY WENT HOME THE KIND MAMMA TOLD TESSA SHE SHOULD BE HER FRIEND AND GAVE HER A MOTHERLY KISS WHICH WARMED THE CHILD'S HEART AND SEEMED TO SET HER SEAL UPON THAT PROMISE
4831-29134-0000 THE SENATOR TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE PULPIT WITH THE MINISTER ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDANT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL ON THE OTHER
4831-29134-0001 SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE PRESENCE OF A LIVING UNITED STATES SENATOR THAT DURING THREE MINUTES A SPITBALL WAS THROWN
4831-29134-0002 AFTER THAT THEY BEGAN TO COME TO THEMSELVES BY DEGREES AND PRESENTLY THE SPELL WAS WHOLLY GONE AND THEY ARE RECITING VERSES AND PULLING HAIR
4831-29134-0003 THE USUAL SUNDAY SCHOOL EXERCISES WERE HURRIED THROUGH AND THEN THE MINISTER GOT UP AND BORED THE HOUSE WITH A SPEECH BUILT ON THAT CUSTOMARY SUNDAY SCHOOL PLAN THEN THE SUPERINTENDENT PUT IN HIS OAR THEN THE TOWN DIGNITARIES HAD THEIR SAY
4831-29134-0004 AM I IN SOME POPULOUS CENTER OF MY OWN COUNTRY WHERE THE CHOICEST CHILDREN OF THE LAND HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND BROUGHT TOGETHER AS IN A FAIR FOR A PRIZE NO
4831-29134-0005 WHEN WHERE AM I YES WHERE AM I
4831-29134-0006 MY SELF IS LOST IN WONDER AT THE THOUGHT
4831-29134-0007 EARTH HAS NO HIGHER NO GRANDER PORTION FOR ME
4831-29134-0008 THEN WHAT IS IT WHICH DID MY CONSCIOUSNESS REPLY
4831-29134-0009 AH THINK OF THIS NOW I COULD HARDLY KEEP THE TEARS BACK I WAS SO GRATEFUL
4831-29134-0010 THEY COULD NOT GIVE HIM A COSTLY EDUCATION BUT THEY WERE GOOD AND WISE AND THEY SENT HIM TO THAT SUNDAY SCHOOL HE LOVED THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
4831-29134-0011 I HOPE YOU LIKE YOUR SUNDAY SCHOOL AYE SEE BY YOUR FACES THAT YOU DO THAT IS RIGHT
4831-29134-0012 ALWAYS LIKE YOUR TEACHERS MY CHILDREN FOR THEY LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN KNOW NOW
4831-29134-0013 AND BY AND BY THE PEOPLE MADE HIM GOVERNOR AND THEY SAID IT WAS ALL OWING TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
4831-29134-0014 WHY THE FELLOW GAVE HIM A TOWERING ILLUSTRIOUS POSITION A GRAND IMPOSING POSITION
4831-29134-0015 IT WAS SENATOR IN THE UNITED STATES
4831-29134-0016 THAT POOR LITTLE BOY THAT LED HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL BECAME THAT MAN THAT MAN STANDS BEFORE YOU
4831-29134-0017 ABOVE ALL THINGS MY CHILDREN ARE HONEST
4831-29134-0018 WHEN SENATOR DILWORTHY DEPARTED FROM CADALLVILLE HE LEFT THREE THOUSAND BOYS BEHIND HIM ARRANGING A CAMPAIGN OF LIFE WHOSE OBJECTIVE POINT WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATE
5543-27761-0000 LULETTA WAS A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
5543-27761-0001 THERE WAS NO OTHER SUCH CHILD THERE NEVER HAD BEEN AND THERE NEVER SHOULD BE
5543-27761-0002 LUELETCHKA'S MOTHER SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA WAS SURE OF THAT
5543-27761-0003 LALLETCHKA'S EYES WERE DARK AND LARGE HER CHEEKS WERE ROSY HER LIPS WERE MADE FOR KISSES AND FOR LAUGHTER
5543-27761-0004 BUT IT WAS NOT THESE CHARMS IN LAMECHKA THAT GAVE HER MOTHER THE KEENEST JOY
5543-27761-0005 SHE FELT WITH HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0006 HE WAS ALWAYS FRESH AND COOL WITH A FRIGID SMILE AND WHEREVER HE PASSED COLD CORNERS SEEMED TO MOVE IN THE AIR
5543-27761-0007 IT EVEN SEEMED TO OUR SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER FUTURE HUSBAND AND THIS MADE HER HAPPY
5543-27761-0008 THE MAID WAS ALSO GOOD LOOKING SHE WAS A TALL DARK EYED DARK HAIRED GIRL SOMEWHAT TIMID BUT VERY TACTFUL
5543-27761-0009 HE HAD CONNECTIONS AND HIS WIFE CAME TO GOOD INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE
5543-27761-0010 THIS COULD AT THE PROPER OPPORTUNITY PROVE USEFUL
5543-27761-0011 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MATTER OF SERGEY MOROSTOVITCH TO SUGGEST ANYTHING WRONG TO HIS WIFE
5543-27761-0012 LATER HOWEVER WHEN HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD SERGEY MOLASTOVITCH ESTABLISHED CONNECTIONS ELSEWHERE OF A LIGHT AND TEMPORARY NATURE
5543-27761-0013 SARAFIA ALEXANDROVNA FOUND THIS OUT AND TO HER OWN ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY HURT SHE AWAITED HER INFANT WITH A RESTLESS ANTICIPATION THAT SWALLOWED EVERY OTHER FEELING
5543-27761-0014 SARAFIAS ALEXANDROVNA DRIFTED FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM HIM
5543-27761-0015 LUTCHKA THEN RAN AWAY STAMPING WITH HER PLUMP LITTLE LEGS OVER THE CARPETS AND HIDING HERSELF BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR HER BED
5543-27761-0016 WHERE IS MY BABY GIRL THE MOTHER ASKED AS SHE LOOKED FOR LAOLACHKA AND MADE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID NOT SEE HER
5543-27761-0017 THEN SHE CAME OUT A LITTLE FARTHER AND HER MOTHER AS THOUGH SHE HAD ONLY JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SEIZED HER BY HER LITTLE SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED JOYOUSLY HERE SHE IS MY ELETCHKA
5543-27761-0018 HER MOTHER'S EYES GLOWED WITH A PASSIONATE EMOTION
5543-27761-0019 HER MOTHER WANTED TO HIDE
5543-27761-0020 LULLETCHKA TURNED AWAY AS THOUGH NOT TO SEE BUT WATCHED HER MAMUCHKA STEALTHILY ALL THE TIME
5543-27761-0021 WHERE IS MY MOTHER MOCHKA ASKED LUETCHKA
5543-27761-0022 A SMILE OF ABSOLUTE BLISS PLAYED OVER HER RED LIPS
5543-27761-0023 THE NETCHKA WAS GETTING NEAR HER MOTHER'S CORNER
5543-27761-0024 HER MOTHER WAS GROWING MORE ABSORBED EVERY MOMENT BY HER INTERESTS IN THE GAME HER HEART BEAT WITH SHORT QUICK STROKES AND SHE PRESSED EVEN CLOSER TO THE WALL DISARRANGING HER HAIR STILL MORE
5543-27761-0025 VALEKA SUDDENLY GLANCED TOWARDS HER MOTHER'S CORNER AND SCREAMED WITH JOY
5543-27761-0026 THROUGH THE HALF CLOSED DOORS HE HEARD THE LAUGHTER OF JOYOUS OUTCRIES THE SOUND OF ROMPING
5543-27761-0027 EVEN FEODORIA FELT ABASHED NOW FOR HER MISTRESS NOW FOR HERSELF
5543-27761-0028 HE LIKED COMING HERE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED THIS WAS DONE BY SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA WHO SEEMED TO SURROUND HER LITTLE GIRL FROM HER VERY INFANCY ONLY WITH THE LOVELIEST THINGS
5543-27761-0029 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA DRESSED HERSELF TASTEFULLY THIS TOO SHE DID FOR LULLOTCHKA WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW
5543-27761-0030 ONE THING SERGEY MODOVITCH HAD NOT BECOME RECONCILED TO AND THIS WAS HIS WIFE'S ALMOST CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN THE NURSERY
5543-27761-0031 IT'S JUST AS I THOUGHT I KNEW HOW I'D FIND YOU HERE HE SAID WITH A DERISIVE AND CONDESCENDING SMILE
5543-27761-0032 MERELY YOU SEE THAT THE CHILD SHOULD FEEL ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY HE EXCLAIMED IN ANSWER TO SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA'S PUZZLED GLANCE
5543-27761-0033 SHE'S STILL SO LITTLE SAID SARAFINO ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0034 I DON'T INSIST IT'S MY KINGDOM HERE
5543-27761-0035 I'LL THINK IT OVER HIS WIFE ANSWERED SMILING AS HE DID COLDLY BUT GENLY
5543-27761-0036 THEN BEGAN TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0037 THAT MY MISTRESS DOES IT WELL THAT'S ONE THING BUT THAT THE YOUNG LADY DOES IT THAT'S BAD
5543-27761-0038 WHY ASKED FIDOCIO WITH CURIOSITY
5543-27761-0039 THIS EXPRESSION OF CURIOSITY GAVE HER FACE THE LOOK OF A MODERN ROUGHLY PAINTED DOLL
5543-27761-0040 YES THAT'S BAD REPEATED AGATHYOT WITH CONVICTION TERRIBLY BAD WELL
5543-27761-0041 IT'S THE TRUTH I'M SAYING REMEMBER MY WORDS AGATHEA WENT ON WITH THAT SAME ASSURANCE AND SECRECY
5543-27761-0042 IT'S THAT SUREST SIGN
5543-27761-0043 THE OLD WOMEN HAD INVENTED THIS SIGN QUITE SUDDENLY HERSELF AND SHE WAS EVIDENTLY VERY PROUD OF IT
5543-27761-0044 MADAM MADAM SHE SAID IN A TREMBLING VOICE
5543-27761-0045 SARANIMA ALEXANDROVNA GAVE A START
5543-27761-0046 FEDOSAL'S FACE MADE HER ANXIOUS
5543-27761-0047 WHAT IS IT FEDOSYA SHE ASKED WITH GREAT CONCERN IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH LULLETZKA
5543-27761-0048 NO MADAM SAID FIDOSIA AS SHE GESTICULATED WITH HER HANDS TO REASSURE HER MISTRESS AND MAKE HER SIT DOWN
5543-27761-0049 LOTCHKA IS ASLEEP MAY GOD BE WITH HER
5543-27761-0050 ONLY I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING YOU SEE LUTSHKA IS ALWAYS HIDING HERSELF THAT IS NOT GOOD
5543-27761-0051 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BAD IT IS SAID FEDOSIA AND HER FACE EXPRESSED THE MOST DELIGHTED CONFIDENCE
5543-27761-0052 I UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF WHAT YOU ARE SINGING
5543-27761-0053 YOU SEE MAMMA IT'S A KIND OF OMEN EXPLAINS FEDOSYA ABRUPTLY IN A SHAMEFACED WAY
5543-27761-0054 NONSENSE SAID SARAFIMO ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0055 WHO TOLD YOU ALL THIS ASKED SARAFIAS ALEXANDROVNA IN AN AUSTERE LOW VOICE
5543-27761-0056 SO EXCLAIMED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA IN IRRITATION AS THOUGH SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HERSELF SOMEHOW FROM THIS SUDDEN ANXIETY
5543-27761-0057 WHAT NONSENSE AS THOUGH LULLATCHKA COULD DIE
5543-27761-0058 SHE SAW CLEARLY THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN A CHILD'S QUITE ORDINARY DIVERSION AND CONTINUATION OF THE CHILD'S LIFE
5543-27761-0059 SHE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT THAT EVENING TO OCCUPY HER MIND WITH OTHER MATTERS BUT HER THOUGHTS TURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO THE FACT THAT LULLETTECHKA LOVED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0060 WHEN LUDSHKA WAS STILL QUITE SMALL AND HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HER NURSE SHE SOMETIMES SITTING IN HER NURSE'S ARMS MADE A SUDDEN ROGUISH GRIMACE AND HID HER LAUGHING FACE IN THE NURSE'S SHOULDER
5543-27761-0061 THEN SHE WOULD LOOK AT WITH A SLY GLANCE
5543-27761-0062 THOUGH SHE REPROACHED HERSELF AT ONCE FOR THIS UNFOUNDED SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD NOT ENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF LUETCHKA'S FAVORITE GAME AND SHE TRIED TO DIVERT LUETZKA'S ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0063 SHE EAGERLY COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S LITTLE WISHES
5543-27761-0064 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA TRIED DESPERATELY TO AMUSE LUETTECHKA
5543-27761-0065 PERHAPS THOUGHT SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA SHE IS NOT AS STRONGLY DRAWN TO THE WORLD AS OTHER GIRLS WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY MANY THINGS
5543-27761-0066 IF THIS IS SO IT IS NOT A SIGN OF ORGANIC WEAKNESS
5543-27761-0067 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA HERSELF BEGAN THE GAME ONCE OR TWICE ALTHOUGH SHE PLAYED IT WITH A HEAVY HEART
5543-27761-0068 SHE SUFFERED AS THOUGH COMMITTING A EVIL DEED WITH FULL CONSCIOUSNESS
5543-27761-0069 IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR SARAFIM ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0070 HER MOTHER COVERED HIM WITH A BLUE BLANKET
5543-27761-0071 LUDETZKA DREW HER SWEET LITTLE HANDS FROM UNDER THE BLANKET AND STRETCHED THEM OUT TO EMBRACE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER BENT DOWN
5543-27761-0072 SHE SEEMED SO SMALL AND SO FRAIL UNDER THE BLANKET I COVERED HER
5543-27761-0073 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA REMAINED STANDING OVER LULETCHKA'S BED A LONG WHILE AND SHE KEPT LOOKING AT LUETSHKA WITH TENDERNESS AND FEAR
5543-27761-0074 I'M A MOTHER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT HER SHE THOUGHT AS SHE IMAGINED THE VARIOUS ILLS THAT MIGHT BEFALL ALATKA
5543-27761-0075 SHE PRAYED LONG THAT NIGHT BUT THE PRAYER DID NOT RELEASE HER SADNESS
5543-27761-0076 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED LULICHKA CAUGHT COLD
5543-27761-0077 THE FEVERS CAME UPON HER AT NIGHT
5543-27761-0078 WHEN SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA AWAKENED BY FEDOSYA CAME TO LAILETCHKA AND SAW HER LOOKING SO HOT SO RESTLESS AND SO TORMENTED SHE INSTANTLY RECALLED THE EVIL OMEN AND A HOPELESS DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS
5543-27761-0079 A DOCTOR WAS CALLED AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS BUT THE INEVITABLE HAPPEN
5543-27761-0080 AND LU METCHKA GREW FEEBLER FROM HOUR TO HOUR
5543-27761-0081 NOTHING MADE HER SO UNHAPPY AS THE REITERATIONS OF FEDOSYA UTTERED BETWEEN SOBS SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF ARO OLECHKA
5543-27761-0082 FEVER WAS CONSUMING LAMECHKA AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND SPOKE IN DELIRIUM
5543-27761-0083 EIGHT DAYS PASSED TORTURING LIKE A NIGHTMARE
5543-27761-0084 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA HID HER FACE BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR LUETSHKA'S BED HOW TRAGIC
5543-27761-0085 AWAIT ME MOTCHKA WHISPERED LULUTSHKA
5543-27761-0086 MOMOTCHKA'S WHITE FACE BECAME BLURRED AND EVERYTHING GREW DARK BEFORE LULLUTSHKA
5543-27761-0087 I MET HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0088 SARAFILE ALEXANDROVNA WAS STANDING BY THE COFFIN AND LOOKING DULLY AT HER DEAD CHILD
5543-27761-0089 SIMMA MY DEAR DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF SAID SERGEY MOLOSTOVITCH IN A WHISPER
5543-27761-0090 YOU SHALL RESIGN YOURSELF TO YOUR FATE
5543-27761-0091 SHE'D BE UP IN A MINUTE PERSISTED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA HER EYES FIXED ON THE DEAD LITTLE GIRL
5543-27761-0092 SERGEY MOROSTOVITCH LOOKED ROUND HIM CAUTIOUSLY HE WAS AFRAID OF THE UNSEEMLY AND THE RIDICULOUS
5543-27761-0093 CEMA DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF HE REPEATED
5543-27761-0094 HE WAS MOVED AND ANNOYED
5543-27761-0095 HER FACE SEEMED TRANQUIL AND HER EYES ARE DRY
5543-27761-0096 SHE WENT INTO THE NURSERY AND BEGAN TO WALK ROUND THE ROOM LOOKING INTO THOSE PLACES WHERE LUETTECHKA USED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0097 SHE WALKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND BENT NOW AND THEN TO LOOK UNDER THE TABLE OR UNDER THE BED AND KEPT ON REPEATING CHEERFULLY WHERE'S MY LITTLE ONE WHERE IS MY LULESCHKA
5543-27761-0098 AFTER SHE HAD WALKED ROUND THE ROOM ONCE SHE BEGAN TO MAKE THE QUEST ANEW
5543-27761-0099 FEDOSYA MOTIONLESS WITH DEJECTED FACE SAT IN A CORNER AND LOOKED FRIGHTENED AT HER MISTRESS WHEN SHE SUDDENLY BURST OUT SOBBING AND SHE WAILED LOUDLY
5543-27761-0100 SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LUELETCHKA ER ANGELIC LITTLE SOUL
5543-27761-0101 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOR THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE BETWEEN HER AND LOTCHKA
5543-27761-0102 THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF HEAVINESS IN SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA'S HEAD AS SHE APPROACHED LULLATCHKA
5543-27761-0103 LULUKA LAY THERE STILL AND PALE AND SMILED PATHETICALLY
5543-27761-0104 THE LITTLE ONE DID NOT RETURN
5543-27761-0105 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA STOOD UP ERECT SIGHED IN A LOST WAY SMILED AND CALLED LOUDLY LUTETCHKA
5543-27761-0106 LULECHKA IS BEING CARRIED OUT
5849-50873-0000 CAP'N BILL THE COMMANDER OF THE SMALL GARRISON AT SEBROOK PERMITTED HIM TO LAND BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO READ HIS COMMISSION BULL ORDERED HIM TO BE SILENT
5849-50873-0001 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MISTER PRINCE WADSWORTH ASKED FOR HE COULD SEE THAT THE MAN WAS GREATLY EXCITED GOVERNOR ANDROX HAS COME AGAIN GASPED MISTER PRINCE WHY SHOULD THAT ALARM US THE FELLOW THOUGH GIVEN TO BOASTING IS NOT DANGEROUS OR LIABLE TO PUT HIS THREATS INTO EXECUTION BUT HE HAS GROWN DANGEROUS DECLARED MISTER PRINCE THE LIBERTIES OF THE COLONY ARE INVOLVED
5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY THOUGH HE IS STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THE MATTER LIGHTLY
5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR PHYSICAL RIGHTS
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VISCEROY HAS COME TO HARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD EXCLAIMED HE SHALL NOT HAVE IT
5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE OFFICERS WERE ENGAGED IN A HEATED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO ATTEND THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THAT CAPTAIN HAS TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED
5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE FAMILY DOING ENGAGED IN A DEBATE
5849-50873-0010 AND WILL HE STAY UNTIL IT IS ENDED HE HAS PROMISED TO DO SO
5849-50873-0011 MISTER PITZ FIXED HIS AMAZED EYES ON THE CAPTAIN'S FACE AND READ THERE A DESPERATE DETERMINATION CAPTAIN HE BEGAN
5849-50873-0012 MISTER PRINCE BOWED AND HASTILY RETURNED TO THE HOUSES WHERE THE ASSEMBLY WAS IN SESSION
5849-50873-0013 AS SOON AS HE WAS DONE CHARLES STEVENS SAID
5849-50873-0014 YES CHARLES YOU WILL ANSWER WHAT DO YOU MEAN
5849-50873-0015 NEVER DID DEBATERS TAKE GREATER INTEREST IN THAT MINOR SUBJECT
5849-50873-0016 WHAT DO YOU INTEND DOING AUNT WILL YOU FIGHT THEM
5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THEIR WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT AT THE TIME NOT TOO SOON NOR TOO LATE
5849-50873-0018 THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE CAPTAIN ASKED
5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO THE ASSEMBLYS
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR VISION
5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PLACE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN GODSWORTH
5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT AS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING PERSONAL ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE AND TWO SETS ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THAT WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATIONED NEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOWS THE FAINT STAR LIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 AND FOLLOWED HIM AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WAS OUTSIDE SEIZED HIS ARM
5849-50873-0028 SAY HAVE A CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WADSWORTH THE TRAIN VANCE CAME UPON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 WHERE IS MY CHARTER
5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HAVE THE TRAIN BEDS OF CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
5849-50873-0032 WHO OF YOU HAS HER CHARTER
5849-50873-0033 HE WAS THE BOY CRIED THE ENRAGED GOVERNOR
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY SHOOK HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE DO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVE IN CONNECTICUT WHERE DOES HE LIVED
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL ASSISTANT DREAM THAT THIS SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH A DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARDS KNOWN AS THE CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER TO THE SEIZURE OF THE CHARTERS WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN THE ASSEMBLY OF RHODE ISLANDS SENT A MOST LOYAL ADDRESS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMALLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO A LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THE TIME UNTIL THE FORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THEIR FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTER TO THE EXPULSION OF ANDROST
5849-50962-0000 CALLED BERT WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTEN READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE
5849-50962-0001 IT'S A SCHOONER SAID MISTER BINGHAM TO MISTER MINTURN AND HE HAS A VERY HEAVY CARGO
5849-50962-0002 IN THIS CORD WAS FASTENED A HEAVY ROPE OR CABLE
5849-50962-0003 WHAT'S THAT BOARD FOR ASKED BERT AS HE SAW A GUARD FOLLOWING THE CABLE
5849-50962-0004 THAT'S THE DANGERS SAID HAL
5849-50962-0005 THEY'RE PRINTED IN A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES AND THEY TELL THE CREW TO CARRY THE END OF THE CABLE HIGH UP TO THE MAST AND FASTEN IT STRONGLY THERE
5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BERT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BUOY WILL GO OUT OF A PULLEY
5849-50962-0007 IT WAS CLEAR TIME NOW AND MUCH OF THE WICKED STORM HAD PASSED
5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS AND WOMEN INTO THE BEACH
5849-50962-0009 MISS BOBBSEY MISSUS MINTURN NELLIE AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND NAN WERE ALL THERE FLOSSIE AND FREDDIE BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINAH AND SUSAN
5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AN BERT AND HAL TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT ON THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BUOY WAS RETURNING
5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER IT CAME UNTIL NOW NOT A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMEN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLY CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFEGUARDS AND A MAN IN THE CORKED BELT BANDED UPON SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND NELLIE WITH HER STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SHRIEKED FALLING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DROWNED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS THOUGH HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
5849-50962-0018 AND DOES GEORGE BINGHAM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE WOMAN
5849-50962-0019 SAFE AND WELL CAME IN THE WELCOME ANSWER
5849-50962-0020 I GUESS OUR PRAYERS WERE HEARD THAT NIGHT
5849-50962-0021 HERE COMES ANOTHER MAN EXCLAIMED THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A YOUNG MAN DASHED ON THE SANDS
5849-50962-0022 WHILE I DECLARE WE DID LAST ON A FRIENDLY SHORE
5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BINGHAM SAID THE LIFE SAVED WORK TURNED OUT TO BE A SOCIAL AFFAIR FOR THERE WAS A GREAT TIME GREETING NELLIE'S FATHER AND HAL'S UNCLE
5849-50962-0024 AND HAL AND HIS FATHER TWO PUT IN NAN
5849-50962-0025 WHAT A MORNING THAT WAS AT THE SUNSET BEACH
5849-50962-0026 I'M SO GLAD I PRAYED SAID LITTLE FLOSSIE TO FREDDIE WHEN SHE HEARD THE GOOD NEWS
5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAS GROWN OUT OF THAT DREADFUL STORM
5849-50963-0001 AND EVERYBODY WERE SO HAPPY
5849-50963-0002 THE NEPTUNE THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SAND BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR THE SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROWBOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF MY CREW TOOK A FEVER
5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT DELAYED SO
5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EVERY LOG LOADED ON THE SCHOONER AND I STARTED OFF
5849-50963-0006 WE COUNTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS VERY STORM STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT A VALUE ASKED MISTER BOBBSEY WHO WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 THE VALUE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MAY NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 BUT I'M A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE MC GLAUGHLAN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US A LIFETIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN THIS YEARS
5849-50963-0011 MAYBE AUNT ALICE WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOPPING TOUR SUGGESTED NAN
5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERKS REMOVE ALL THE TRUCKS FROM THE AISLES AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL
5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR LIVES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FACED AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BYE TO YOU NELLIE TOLD DOROTHY AND NAN IN NEXT MORNING
5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NANNY
5849-50964-0002 YOU ARE QUITE DIFFERENT NOW AREN'T YOU REMARKED DOROTHY
5849-50964-0003 AND DOROTHY WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S STRONG SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU RETURNED THE JOKING DOROTHY
5849-50964-0005 COME NELLIE CALLED MISSUS MC GLAUGHLAN I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HEAD
5849-50964-0006 THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NELLIE TOLD HIM
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE US THROUGH HIS HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MOST O EM I GUESS ANSWERED BERT
5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD VACATION I AM WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
5849-50964-0010 SO HAVE I DECLARED NAN VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FREDIE AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP TO THE CAT
5849-50964-0013 AND SO THEIR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION
6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL TO EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LAST VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS THE NOVELIST OF CULTURE
6123-59150-0003 CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DISTINCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A ROYAL AUTHOR
6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN SILENCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICTS
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LOST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LOST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED THE SCENE OF NEKHLUDOFF IN RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MAD HOUSE CRIED SOME ONE IN THE IDIAS
6123-59150-0009 ONE RESULTS OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
6123-59150-0010 EVEN THEIR TALK WAS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE TUCK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH IN A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD BELIEVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY NIGHT HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ANA KARENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHIZED INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY IN PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST OR ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICARIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES
6123-59150-0020 HE WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE MORTAL MANIACS
6123-59150-0022 SERVE HER RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN TO KILL HIM
6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE THROUGH SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
6123-59150-0026 DOSTIEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFFIEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEOKONSKI AGLAYA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VAYA FERUSHENKO NASTASIA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL VOLGAN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE SOLITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ADMITS THE DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF HIS STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRE TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
6123-59150-0033 BESIDES THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE SURE
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL IN DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CERTEVOS
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE OWN UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATION THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MISHKIN IN THE MIDNIGHT
6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE WEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
6123-59150-0041 THE DEVILS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUGUES DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN THE POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THEIR PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND TENDER MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVEL A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS
6123-59150-0046 THERE IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS
6123-59186-0000 AND HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND SUMMER
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISSUS HARDY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE WHOLLY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THEN HE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THERE SHOULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 AND PROSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS ON IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POLE ABOUT
6123-59186-0008 WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THAT THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 CARTERING CARE IS AN APPALLING PHRASE
6123-59186-0010 AND A LINE OF GOOD POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YE DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUAL MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVEL OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT THE FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST PRINCESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A CHANCE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES
6123-59186-0016 A WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER AND THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDE'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD SURELY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY
6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO TAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDI'S POEMS THE OXEN
6123-59186-0022 WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN OUR STORY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN
6123-59186-0023 THE MOOD OF DEATH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOOD
6123-59186-0024 HE COULD ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY
6123-59186-0025 HOW LONG HE CRIES IN HIS POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO
6123-59186-0026 WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORNING TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS
6123-59186-0027 BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION AS SENIOR SOUL FLAMES AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE
6123-59186-0028 AND GENERAL HELL HOLD OFF OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES
6123-59186-0029 SOME FICKLE AND SWEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM NEW LOVES
6123-59186-0030 AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DULL THEY ON OUR DEEDS
6123-59186-0031 MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BUSY A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR
6123-59186-0032 THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A SERIOUS IRRELEVANCE
6123-59186-0033 IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDIER'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE
6123-59186-0034 FUTITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH
6123-59186-0035 HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS BROUGHT IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY
6123-59186-0036 LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERE TO BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH
6123-59186-0037 IN BEYOND THE LAST LENGTH WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE
6123-59186-0038 NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON TO YOURS ONE RAVEN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES
6123-59186-0039 THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE IMMENSER THAN OUR OWN
6123-59186-0040 NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSELIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLACKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYS
6267-53049-0000 IT'S A SAD THING FOR A CHILD TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T IT
6267-53049-0001 PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYHOW THOUGHT THE AULDER SISTER WISTFULLY
6267-53049-0002 DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND TALKED ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY
6267-53049-0003 SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THO SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMIRED IT FOR THE WORLD
6267-53049-0004 SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO DAY A NEW DRESS
6267-53049-0005 DORIS HUNTER I BELIEVE IT'S OLD QUILT
6267-53049-0006 LISTEN PENELOPE MY DEAR DO
6267-53049-0007 LOVE THE PENELOP AND YOURSELF
6267-53049-0008 YOUR AFFECTIONATE FRIEND ADELA HUNTER
6267-53049-0009 I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH HER GREAT
6267-53049-0010 IT MAY HAVE BEEN A PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL FADED NOW
6267-53049-0011 TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER MOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN
6267-53049-0012 IT WAS VERY KIND OF OLD ADELA TO SEND IT SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY
6267-53049-0013 WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT SUGGESTED PENELOPE
6267-53049-0014 WHAT LOVELY OLD TINY STUFF AND NOT A BIT
6267-53049-0015 I DECLARE IT IS AS GOOD AS TRUE
6267-53049-0016 WELL LET US GO AND HAVE CHEAT SAID PENELOPE I'D DECIDEDLY HUNGRY
6267-53049-0017 BESIDES I SEE THE POVERTY BALCKER COMING
6267-53049-0018 IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSES IN HEIRLOOM AFTER ALL
6267-53049-0019 PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HURT COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY AND THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS A POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET
6267-53049-0020 SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY CREATURE THERE
6267-53049-0021 PENELOPE HAD THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER CHARMING
6267-53049-0022 SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF A FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
6267-53049-0023 MY AUNT ADELA GAVE ME AND GAVE US THE MATERIAL SHE STAMMERED
6267-53049-0024 I'M NAMED AFTER HER MISSUS BLACKWATER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVELY OLD FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND TENDERNESS
6267-53049-0025 THEN YOU IS MY GRAND NIECE SHE SAID
6267-53049-0026 WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNISE THIS ROSE BUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN THIBET
6267-53049-0027 PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE DIVIDED TO EACH OTHER
6267-53049-0028 SOON AFTER THAT OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSE HOLD WAS BROKEN UP
6267-53049-0029 MY DEAR I WAS A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME
6267-53049-0030 NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FARWORTH'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY
6267-53049-0031 DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS CHANGED IN THE TWINED CLING OF THE EYE
6267-53049-0032 WHEN MISSUS FAIREWETHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
6267-65525-0000 AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CAME TO HER FROM BELOW
6267-65525-0001 AND JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BABY CLANGING TO THE OTHER
6267-65525-0002 SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND WILD AS A SUNFLOWER WAS AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS
6267-65525-0003 I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BIGGSBY IS THIS EVENING SID AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK
6267-65525-0004 SYDNEY SIGHED AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS FOR A BABY
6267-65525-0005 ALL HER DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULNESS WENT BUT SHE KEPT THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
6267-65525-0006 BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHERE SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER
6267-65525-0007 THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX ABOUT THE KITCHEN WHICH SYDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS
6267-65525-0008 HER BED AND THE COT WHERE A LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE
6267-65525-0009 JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A PIG AND THE MOUTH ZIGZAGED FROM EAR TO EAR
6267-65525-0010 SYDNEY HATED THAT MEASURE AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD HATE ANYTHING
6267-65525-0011 HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SYDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME TO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THE DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID
6267-65525-0012 PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO FIGHT WITH A FLUSH OF REAL EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE
6267-65525-0013 ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO ELLEN DOUGLAS AND THAT WAS FORWARDED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFFERING EDITOR OF THE MAIL LEAF
6267-65525-0014 HE WROTE THAT ALTHOUGH HIS AGE BETRAYED HIM FROM MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB HE WAS TWENTY AND THE LIMIT WAS EIGHTEEN HE READ THE LETTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH MUCH INTEREST AND OFTEN HAD THOUGHT OF ANSWERING SOME OF THE REQUESTS FOR CORRESPONDENTS
6267-65525-0015 HE NEVER HAD DONE SO BUT ELLEN DOUGLAS'S LETTER WAS SO INTERESTING THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO WRITE FOR HER
6267-65525-0016 WOULD SHE BE KINGLY ENOUGH TO CORRESPOND WITH HIM
6267-65525-0017 HE WAS TWO DAYS OUT FROM THE EAST AND HAD NOT YET FORGOTTEN TO BE HOMESICK AT TIMES
6267-65525-0018 SYDNEY EXPECTED THE LETTER AND ANSWERED IT
6267-65525-0019 SHE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET JOHN LANE NOR DID SHE WISH TO DO SO
6267-65525-0020 IN A CORRESPONDENCE ITSELF SHE FOUND HER PLEASURE
6267-65525-0021 JOHN LINCOLN WROTE BREEZY ACCOUNTS OF STRANGE LIFE AND ADVENTURES ON THE FAR WESTERN PLAINS SO ALIEN AND REMOTE FROM SNUG HUMDRUM PLANEFIELD LIFE THAT SYDNEY ALWAYS HAD THE SENSATION OF CROSSING A GULF WHEN SHE OPENED A LETTER FROM THE BAR AND AS FOR SYDNEY'S OWN LETTER THIS IS THE WAY IT READ AS SHE WROTE IT
6267-65525-0022 THEIR EVERGREENS PLAINFIELD DEAR MISTER LINCOLN
6267-65525-0023 I LOVE LIFE AND ITS BLOOM AND BRILLIANCY I LIKE MEETING NEW PEOPLE I LOVE THE RIPPLE OF MUSIC THE HUM OF LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION
6267-65525-0024 THE MAN I HAD BEEN TALKING WITH WAS PAUL MOORE THE GREAT NOVELISTS
6267-65525-0025 AS IT WAS I HAD CONTRADICTED HIM TWICE AND HE HAD LAUGHED AND LIKED IT AND HIS BOOKS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A NEW MEANING TO ME HENCEFORTH THROUGH THE INSIGHT HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN ME
6267-65525-0026 IT IS SUCH MEETINGS AS THESE THAT GIVE LIFE ITS SPARKLE FOR YOU
6267-65525-0027 IT WILL BE WEARY OF MY RHAPSODIES OVER HER
6267-65525-0028 SHE HAS SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR MY EVERY LOT
6267-65525-0029 YOURS SINCERELY SYDNEY RICHMONDS
6267-65525-0030 OLD JANE CAME HOME PRESENTLY AND CARRIED AWAY HER SLEEPING BABY SYDNEY SAID HER PRAYERS WENT TO BED AND SLEPT SOUNDLY AND SERENNILY SHE MAILED HER LETTER THE NEXT DAY AND A MONTH LATER THE ANSWER CAME
6267-65525-0031 SYDNEY DID NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT BUT DOZED RESTLESSLY ABOUT OR CRIED UNDER HER PILLOW
6267-65525-0032 THE BIG WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD
6267-65525-0033 SYDNEY TROD THE WAY OF THE TRANSGRESSOR AND FOUND THAT ITS THORNS BORED TO BONE AND MARROW
6267-65525-0034 YE SEE THAT ROAD OUT DARK
6267-65525-0035 AND THERE WAS NO HARBOR NOR GLIMPSE OF DISTANT SEA VISIBLE
6267-65525-0036 HAD THE HALTER KEEPER MADE HIS MISTAKE
6267-65525-0037 THIS IS HIS PLACE NOBODY CALLS IT DE EVERGREEN BUT MYSELF

6467-94831-0045 OH YOU CAN'T JUDGE ME NO MORE
6467-97061-0000 ONE NIGHT WHEN BOTH WERE SLEEPING THE PRINCE HAD A DREADFUL DREAM
6467-97061-0001 THEY RUSHED INTO THE ROOM ADDED THEIR CRIES TO HERS AND FORGETTING ALL THEIR FORMER PRECAUTIONS LEFT THE DOORS OPEN SO THAT THE GUARDS OUTSIDE HEARING THE CLAMOR ENTERED AND SAW THE PRINCESS
6467-97061-0002 SHE IS A DISGRACE TO HER FATHER AND SHALL SOON SEE HER HUSBAND IMPALED ON A STAKE
6467-97061-0003 THEN WITH HIS FOREHEAD DISFIGURED WITH A FEARFUL FROWN HE CONTINUED TO ABUSE THE PRINCE AND HAVING TIED HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM DRAGGED HIM FROM THE ROOM
6467-97061-0004 TREATED THUS LIKE SOME WILD BEAST ROUGHLY SHAKEN AND NEGLECTED RAJAHANNA WOULD HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY HAD HE NOT BEEN PROTECTED BY THE MAGIC DOLL GIVEN TO HIM IN PATHHALLA AND WHICH HE HAD CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IN HIS HAIR
6467-97061-0005 ADVANCING THEREFORE WITH A GREAT ARMY HE PREPARED TO BESIEGE CHAMPA THE CAPITAL CITY
6467-97061-0006 A TERRIBLE BATTLE ENSUED IN WHICH BOTH KINGS WERE PROVED PRODIGIES OF VALOR
6467-97061-0007 SHOULD THERE BE ANY PITY FOR THE VIOLATOR OF THE HAREMS
6467-97061-0008 IF THE OLD KING MY FATHER NOW IN HIS STRATAGE WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO FAVOUR THE CRIMINAL FOR THE SAKE OF HIS WORTHLESS DAUGHTER YOU HAD NO NEED OF HIS PERMISSION AND OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY HIM
6467-97061-0009 LET THAT VILE SEDUCER BE IMMEDIATELY PUT TO DEATH BY TORTURE AND HIS PARAMOUR TO BE SHUT UP IN PRISON TILL I COME
6467-97061-0010 HAVE READY ALSO A FIERCE ELEPHANT SUITABLY EQUIPPED WHICH I SHALL MOUNT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WEDDING TO OVERTAKE MY ARMY IN MARCH AGAINST THE ENEMY AND AS I SET OUT I WILL MAKE THE ELEPHANT TRAMPLE THE LIFE OUT OF THAT CRI
6467-97061-0011 WHILE HE STOOD THERE CALMLY AWAITING DEATH WHICH NOW SEEMED INEVITABLE HE SUDDENLY FELT HIS FEET FREE AND A BEAUTIFUL LADY APPEARED BEFORE THEM
6467-97061-0012 SHE HUMBLY BOWING DOWN SAID LET MY LORD PARDON HIS SERVANT FOR THE INJURY WHICH SHE HATH UNCONSCIOUSLY CAUSED
6467-97061-0013 I AM AN APSOLUS BORN FROM THE RAYS OF THE MOON
6467-97061-0014 ONE DAY AS I WAS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR BEARING A WHITE DRESS A SWAN MISTAKING ME FOR A LOTUS FLOWER ATTACKED ME
6467-97061-0015 IN HIS ANGUISH HE CURSED ME SAYING O WICKED ONE FOR THIS OFFENCE YOU ARE CONDEMNED TO BE CHANGED INTO A PIECE OF UNCONSCIOUS METAL
6467-97061-0016 THE CHANGE TOOK PLACE IMMEDIATELY AND I FELL TO THE GROUND TURNED INTO THE SILVER CHAIN
6467-97061-0017 ON HIS WAY HE SAW THE SILVER NETTLE DESCENDED TO THE GROUND PICKED IT UP AND CONTINUED HIS FLIGHT
6467-97061-0018 THE SLAYER OF GENDRAVAMA HEARING THIS CAME OUT OF THE PALACE AND QUICKLY MOUNTING THE ELEPHANT WHO HELD DOWN HIS TRUNK TO RECEIVE HIM PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE PRINCESS
6467-97061-0019 GREAT WAS THEIR MUTUAL ASTONISHMENT AND JOY WHEN THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER THE PRINCE EXCLAIMING IS IT POSSIBLE

6467-97061-0021 THROUGH THESE THEY FORCED THEIR WAY EMPLOYING WITH GOOD EFFECTS THE WEAPONS PLACED ON THE ELEPHANT FOR THE USE OF GENDRAMAN
6467-97061-0022 BEFORE HOWEVER THEY HAD GONE FAR THEY HEARD THE NOISE OF BATTLE AT SOME DISTANCE AND SAW THE SOLDIERS IN FRONT OF THEM SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS
6467-97061-0023 WE HAVE JUST NOW ENCOUNTERED AND UTTERLY DEFEATING THE ENEMY SO THAT THERE IS NO FEAR OF ANY FURTHER RESISTANCE
6467-97061-0024 RAJAMANI AGREED TO THIS
6599-38590-0000 WHATEVER HAND IT WAS THAT SHOT DOWN BOURBON ROME AFTER HIS DEATH WAS THUNDERED DEVASTATED AND RAVAGED BY A BRUTAL GREEDY LICENTIOUS AND FANATICAL SOLDIERY

6599-38590-0005 NAY SAID FRANCIS I WILL NOT SUFFER HIM TO SPEAK TO ME BEFORE HE HAS GIVEN ME AN APPOINTMENT OF TIME AND PLACE
6599-38590-0006 GIVE IT ME OH RETURN AS THOU HAST COME
6599-38590-0007 I AM QUITE WILLING SAID THE QUEEN LET HIM HAVE IT
6599-38590-0008 THE PIECE OF CAMBREE WAS CALLED THE LADY'S PIECE IN HONOUR OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO HAD NEGOTIATED IT THOUGH MORALLY DIFFERENT AND OF VERY UNEQUAL WORTH THEY BOTH HAD MINDS OF A RARE ORDER AND TRAINED TO RECOGNISE POLITICAL NECESSITIES AND NOT TO ATTEMPT ANY BUT POSSIBLE SUCCESSES
6599-38590-0009 ALL THE GREAT POLITICAL ACTORS SEEMED HURRYING AWAY FROM THE STAGE AS IF THE DRAMA WERE APPROACHING THE END
6599-38591-0000 IN FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO AT THE BATTLE OF DERU HE WAS AGED AND SO ILL THAT NONE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM ON HORSEBACK
6599-38591-0001 HE FULLY ARMED SAVE ONLY HIS HEAD ANSWERED HIM RIGHT WELL SIR THIS IS THE REAL MEDICINE THAT HATH CURED ME FOR THE BATTLE WHICH IS TOWARD AND ARE PREPARING FOR THE HONOR OF GOD IN OUR CAMP
6599-38591-0002 THE LAD'S PEACE CONCLUDED AT CAMBRAY IN FIFTEEN TWENTY NINE LASTED UP TO FIFTEEN THIRTY SIX INCESSANTLY TROUBLED HOWEVER BY FAR FROM PACIFIC SYMPTOMS PROCEEDINGS AND PREPARATIONS
6599-38591-0003 AT LAST HE DECIDED UPON REPAIRING
6599-38591-0004 IT WAS GARSILASO DE LA VEGA THE PRINCE OF SPANISH POESY THE SPANISH PETRARCH ACCORDING TO HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN
6599-38591-0005 MONTMORENCY SIGNED A SIMILAR ONE FROM PIEDMA
6599-38591-0006 THEY ALL REPAIRED TOGETHER TO THE HOUSE PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND AFTER DINNER THE EMPEROR BEING TIRED LAY DOWN TO REST ON A COUCH QUEEN ELEANOR BEFORE LONG WENT AND TAPPED AT THE DOOR AND SENT WORD TO THE KING THAT THE EMPEROR WAS AWAKE
6599-38591-0007 FRANCES WITH A CARDINAL DE LORRAINE AND THE CONSTABLE DE MONTMORENCY SOON ARRIVED
6599-38591-0008 ON ENTERING HIS CHAMBER HE FOUND THE EMPEROR STILL LYING DOWN AND CHATTING WITH HIS SISTER THE QUEEN WHO WAS SEATED BESIDE HIM ON A CHAIR
6599-38591-0009 YES SAID CHARLES I HAD MADE SUCH CHANGE THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SLEEP IT OFF
6599-38591-0010 FRANCIS DID THE CONVERSE WITH HIS OWN SCHOLAR
6599-38591-0011 ONLY SEVEN OF THE ATTENDANTS REMAINED IN THE EMPEROR'S CHAMBER AND THERE THE TWO LOVERS CONVERSED FOR AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THEY MOVED TO THE HALL WHERE A SPLENDID SUPPER AWAITED THEM
6599-38591-0012 THE VENTIS PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE ARE RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ASSERTION
6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DROP BACK TO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE AND THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S SOB BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE RAMOUTA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDON CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE COWS WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE SAL GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANCE
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASEWOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILDING THE FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIDE DOOR AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J H STORMING IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS UPON THE FENCE SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTING TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED FORTH IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODIN AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE HOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
6841-88291-0013 HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SET OVER ON ONE STRIP TO AVOID THE TIGHTENED LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO MY CALF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE GIRL STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULL DOGGEDS IMMEDIATELY POUNCE UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY DUPPED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 THAT THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR THE RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULLDOGGERS
6841-88291-0021 MARKS YELLED THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BRANDER PRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY ACROSS THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF WAILED A LITTLE LEST THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOWS CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOR TO INDICATE DUE PEELING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OFF A SWALLOW TAIL ON THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNPLEASANT TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDON
6841-88291-0027 UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT POSSIBLE AND COULD SOME OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADOPT IT IN PREFERENCE
6841-88291-0028 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THE SPIRIT OF THIS DOCTRINE THROUGH ARIZONA
6841-88291-0029 IMAGINE A PUNCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TACKS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR IN A ROUNDUP
6841-88291-0030 A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEEDING OR TO WALKING IDLY ABOUT
6841-88291-0031 BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT THEN TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD OUR TEETH FILLED
6841-88291-0032 ONE OF THE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS BUT A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEG BUT TOSSED HIS LOOP OVER ITS NECK
6841-88291-0033 MISTER FROST'S BULL CALF ALONE IN PICTORIAL HISTORY SHOWS HIS ATTITUDES
6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERPLUTABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER
6841-88291-0035 SO HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HELD
6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD CATCH HIMSELF AT ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE VIGOROUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING BACK TO THE UPRIGHT
6841-88291-0037 I CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
6841-88291-0038 THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME FUN THOUGH IT FAILS
6841-88291-0039 BY NOW THE BRIGHTON WAS IN FULL SWING
6841-88291-0040 WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID A CAST FAIL
6841-88291-0041 MEN CAME TO AND FRO BUSY AND INTENT
6841-88291-0042 SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR CALVES WERE AT THE GROUND AT ONCE
6841-88291-0043 DUST HEADED AND DISSIPATED
6841-88291-0044 NO MORE NEG CALVES THEY ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0045 THEN HE WOULD SPIT ON HIS HANDS AND GO AT IT ALONG
6841-88291-0046 IF LUCK ATTENDED HIS FIRST EFFORT HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND WHERE'S YOUR LITTLE CALF SAID HE
6841-88291-0047 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THIS FAR WITH YOUR LITTLE LIGHT IRON
6841-88291-0048 TOWARD NOON THE WORK SMACKED
6841-88291-0049 FINALLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMAN AND REPORTED THE BRAND AND FINISHED
6841-88291-0050 THE LATTER COUNTED THE MARKS IN HIS TALLY BOOT
6841-88291-0051 ONE THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX HE ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0052 THE MARKERS SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS TOLD OVER THE BITS OF LEAVES THEY HAD SAVED
6841-88291-0053 THAT TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
6841-88291-0054 FINALLY LONDON DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HIP POCKET
6841-88291-0055 THEY HAD BEEN DOING A WRESTLER'S EVIL WORK ALL THE MORNING BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED
6841-88291-0056 I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY WELL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN'S AND THAT IT EXERCISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF THE BODY
6841-88294-0000 AT THE MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THE STORM ON THE ROOF CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EAVES
6841-88294-0001 WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKING OUT AT A PUBLIC GAME I SAW THEM ALL
6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEEL OR CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN MY LEFT LEG
6841-88294-0003 THEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD CUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HEAD
6841-88294-0004 IN PLACE OF IT HE WORE A DARK STEEL HOOK
6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHIN HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DIDN'T SOUND MUCH
6841-88294-0006 WHEN A MAN BREATHS THAT WAY HE'S MOSTLY ALL GONE
6841-88294-0007 MEN GOT BOTTED OVER THE HEAD OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
6841-88294-0008 SOUR WINE IS FINE TO PUT A WOUND IN SHAPE TO HEAL BUT IT'S NO SOOTHING SYRUP
6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRAVE IT WAS A SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEA DONE ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBAREE
6841-88294-0010 IT FAIR MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH THE BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE AND THE QUIET MOONLIGHT ON THE SHADOWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZONING EACH SIDE HIS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER THE RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO GET HIM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AN PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP
6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN HE'D SING THAT BARBARY SONG UNTIL I'D GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWIN BY JUST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DIED AND GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE'D JEST TALK
6841-88294-0013 IT BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND HE GAVE HIS SIDE OF CONVERSATIONS PAUSING FOR REPLIES
6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THE HOUR BUT I NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE'S COME FROM OR WHAT HE'D DONE
6841-88294-0015 I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HE WAS QUIETLY
6841-88294-0016 USUALLY I DON'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING A SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
6841-88294-0017 HE WAS LYING AT HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES SHE ASKED VERY INTENSE
6841-88294-0019 ONE LITTLE SQUEEZE TALK BOUT YOUR DEADLY WEAPONS
6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'D BEEN TOO SICK AND TOO LONG AT BED
6841-88294-0021 IN A WEEK OR SO HE CAME TO
6841-88294-0022 NOW YOU'RE A NICE STRAIGHT PROPOSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
6841-88294-0023 THEY'RE SAFE ENOUGH TO LET ME HAVE THEM HE BEGGED
6841-88294-0024 NOW LOOK HERE SAID I YOU CAN'T GET UP TO DAY YOU AIN'T HIT
6841-88294-0025 YOU KNOW HE PLEADED BUT LET ME SEE THEM
6841-88294-0026 JUST TO SATISFY HIM I PASSED OVER THIS OLD DUDS
6841-88294-0027 I'M BEEN ROBBED SHE CRIED
6841-88294-0028 WHERE'S MY COAT HE EXCLAIMED
6841-88294-0029 YOU HAD NO COAT WHEN I PUT YOU UP I REPLIED
6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED AT ME MIGHTY SUSPICIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDNT EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
6841-88294-0031 AFTER HE'D EATEN A REAL MEAL HE FELL ASLEEP
6841-88294-0032 WHEN HE CAME BACK THAT EVENING THE BUNK WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE
6841-88294-0033 I DIDN'T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR SOME DAYS
6841-88294-0034 NOW I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM QUITE A WAYS OFF
6841-88294-0035 GUESS HE'S SUSPICIOUS I STOLE THAT OLD COAT O HIS THINKS I AN AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT
6841-88294-0036 HOWEVER I DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THAT FRAME OF MIND
6841-88294-0037 I RAN UP PUSHING MY GUN
6841-88294-0038 THAT MEX WAS FLAT ON HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
6841-88294-0039 ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK FELT MY ONE ARMED FRIEND
6841-88294-0040 ANYWAY I THRUST THE MUZZLE O MY COLT INTO THE SAILOR'S FACE WHAT'S THIS I ASKED
6841-88294-0041 I WEEN HIM ET MONTE OF ANTONIO CREVAZ SAID HE
6841-88294-0042 THAT GLEAM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SNARL LIFTED HIS LIPS
6841-88294-0043 IN ANY CASE HE BLEW POCO PRONTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
6841-88294-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOSTLY DOING ODD JOBS I SAW IT OFF AND ON
6841-88294-0045 HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THAT TIME ALMIGHTY BUSY HOLDIN DOWN MY CARD GAMES
6841-88294-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YOU BETTER STAY RIGHT HERE
6841-88294-0047 I MEAN TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE SAID HE
6841-88294-0048 WHAT KIND OF GOOD THING I ASKED TREASURE WAS HE
6841-88294-0049 HE LOOKED ALL RIGHT ENOUGH NEVER DRUNK NOR LOCO
6841-88294-0050 SIT DOWN SAID HE OVER THERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE
6841-88294-0051 HE DID SO AS FAR AWAY SAID I
6841-88294-0052 IT'S A BIG THING SAID HANDY SOLOMON TO ME FOR THEY'S NOT ONLY GOLD BUT ULTRA JEWELS AND DIAMONDS
6841-88294-0053 IT WILL MAKE US RICH AND THE DOZEN LIKE US AND YOU CAN KISS THE BOOK ON THAT
6841-88294-0054 THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I AND WHY DO YOU TELL ME
6841-88294-0055 WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR MEASURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF DIVIDING IT
6841-88294-0056 I MATE HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAIN GRATITUDE
6841-88294-0057 DIDN'T YOU SAVE MY LIFE AND NUSS ME AN TAKE CARE O ME WHEN I WAS NOT KILLED
6841-88294-0058 LOOK HERE ANDERSON OR HANDY SOLOMON OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO CALL YOURSELF I REJOINED TO THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU WILL HAVE TO TALK STRAIGHT
6841-88294-0059 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO MAKE GRATITUDE BUT THAT DON'T GO WITH ME
6841-88294-0060 THE DEVIL'S A PREACHER IF YOU HAIN'T LOST YOUR PEN FEATHER SAID HE
6841-88294-0061 WELL IT'S THIS THEN I GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GET THERE AND SHE MUST BE STOPED
6841-88294-0062 AN I GOT T HAVE HELP WI THE TREASURE IF IT'S LIKE THIS FELLOW SAID IT WAS

6841-88294-0064 WHY ME I ASKED WHY NOT HE INTERRUPTED
6841-88294-0065 WE TALKED THE MATTER OVER AT ONCE
6841-88294-0066 A STOOD OUT FOR A LARGER PARTY
6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS AS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT I HAVE NO INTENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY WE COMPROMISED
6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THAT TREASURE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SCHEME DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
700-122866-0000 JUNIOR AVONLEA HAD FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE AGAIN
700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLE IN EVERYDAY LIFE
700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY JULIA DISAPPROVES OF THEM
700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE COMFORTABLE YET
700-122866-0004 I JUST LAY AWAKE AND IMAGINE THE CONCERTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS NEW INTERESTS
700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WILL HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAMME AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY
700-122866-0007 THE WINTER LEAVES SLIP BY
700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THIS CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON WRITE A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT
700-122866-0009 I COULD SCARCELY REALIZE THAT I'M IN MY TEENS
700-122866-0010 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT I' WILL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT
700-122866-0011 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BEAUCE SAID ANNE DISDAINFULLY
700-122866-0012 SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ANY ONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN IT TAKE NOTICE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
700-122866-0013 I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLEN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE WAS PERFECT
700-122866-0014 IF I HAD ALICE BELL'S CROOKED NOSE SAID ANN DECIDEDLY I WOULDN'T BUT THERE
700-122866-0015 I'M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH OF MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMPLEMENT ABOUT IT LONG AGO
700-122866-0016 OH DIANA LOOK THERE'S A RAFT
700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMED PRETTY DREAMS
700-122866-0018 I WROTE HIM LAST MONDAY EVENING
700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR IN DEATH NO DIVIDED
700-122866-0020 I READ IT TO MARILLA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF AN NONSENSE
700-122866-0021 IT'S A SORRY SWEET STORY
700-122866-0022 CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORNET OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DUCKLY FLASHING EYES
700-122866-0023 WE KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE
700-122866-0024 THEY GREW IN BEAUTY SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WAS SIXTEEN
700-122866-0025 I ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY ON A SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED
700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FATHER THE SAME AS EVER
700-122866-0027 LET'S YOU AND ME HAVE A JOLLY CLUB ALL OUR OWN AND WRITE STORIES FOR PRACTICE
700-122866-0028 YOU OUGHT TO CULTIVATE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS MACY SAYS SO
700-122866-0029 ONLY WE MUST TAKE THE BACK WAY
700-122866-0030 IT WAS HOW THE STORY CLUB CAME INTO EXISTENCE
700-122866-0031 NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING BUT EACH MEMBER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK
700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO TELL HER STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN WE TALK IT OVER
700-122866-0033 MINE IS ROSAMONDE MONTMORENY ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
700-122866-0034 I'M SURE THEY MUST HAVE A WHOLESOME EFFECT
700-122866-0035 THE MORAL IS THE GRAND THING MISTER ALLEN SAYS SO
700-122866-0036 I READ ONE OF MY STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLEN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MODE WAS EXCELLENT
700-122866-0037 JANE AND RUBY OFTEN ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC PARTS
700-122866-0038 MISS JOSEPHINE BARTY WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE
700-122866-0039 I'M SURE MISSUS ALLEN WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU
700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I HEARD THEM
700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE ALWAYS FELT SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANY ONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMART THEY WERE
700-122866-0042 WELL I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
700-122867-0000 IT VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT
700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND SYLVIA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL GLADNESS
700-122867-0002 I MUST SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I HAVE NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT OR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW
700-122867-0003 PERHAPS YOU'RE JUDGING HER TOO HASTILY SYLVIA
700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'LL TAKE HER PART MATTHEW BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU
700-122867-0005 DEMANDED MARGUERITE ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO THE BED
700-122867-0006 ANNE COWERED DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOREVER FROM MORTAL EYES OH
700-122867-0007 GET RIGHT UP THIS MINUTE AND TELL HIM
700-122867-0008 THIS MINUTE I SAY THERE NOW THAT IS IT
700-122867-0009 ANNE HAD SLID TO THE FLOOR IN DESPAIRED OBEDIENCE
700-122867-0010 YES THAT'S GREEN MOANED ANNE
700-122867-0011 I FELT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS RED HAIR
700-122867-0012 YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR ALL TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
700-122867-0013 NOW THEN WHAT DID YOU DO IN YOUR HAIR
700-122867-0014 AND SHIRLEY DOESN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO
700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED ANNA
700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DADDER
700-122867-0017 MISSUS ALLEN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANY ONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT
700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T DONE AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY
700-122867-0019 WHO'S THEN WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
700-122867-0020 OH I DIDN'T GET HIM IN THE HOUSE
700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH HER BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE
700-122867-0022 OH MARILLA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE HEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTISE TO DECEIVE
700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO UP WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
700-122867-0024 WITH A DIM SIGH SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSORS
700-122867-0025 BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'D DYED IT A DREADFUL COLOUR IS THERE
700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO WEEP ALL THE TIME YOU'RE TAKING IT OFF IF IT WON'T INTERFERE
700-122867-0027 IT SEEMED SUCH A GIGANTIC THING
700-122867-0028 ANNE WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UP STAIRS AND LOOKED IN A GLASS SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
700-122867-0029 YES I WENT TOO
700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND PEARLY
700-122867-0031 I EXPECT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO MY HANDS NEXT
700-122867-0032 ANN'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY AND TO HER RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCART SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I DIDN'T
700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS IF YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T IT
700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS AND I SHALL NEVER WISH TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE BETTER
700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARTHA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLEN AND MISS STACY AND GROW UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU
700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VIOLET RIBBON AROUND MY HEAD WITH A BOW AT ONE SIDE
700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL IT A SNODE THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
700-122867-0040 MY HEAD IS BETTER THEN
700-122867-0041 IT WAS TERRIBLE BAD THAT AFTERNOON THOUGH
700-122868-0000 OF COURSE IT MUST BE ELAINE ANNE SAID DIANA
700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW THAT YOU COULDN'T KEEP STILL
700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S TOO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A RED HEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNE
700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS A LILY LAD
700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND OUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO THROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANN'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATISE ALAINE
700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE REST
700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING E LANE
700-122868-0009 THE BLACKSHELL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPED IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN IN THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LINDE WAS BORN
700-122868-0011 JANE YE ARRANGES
700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE S DEAD
700-122868-0013 JANE ROSE TO THE OCCASION AND
700-122868-0014 LEFT BEHIND FOR THE LANDING
700-122868-0015 JANE GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
700-122868-0016 THERE IS THE CHANCE JUST ONE
700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWER BY PRAYER
700-122868-0018 THE FLAT DRIFTED UNDER THE BRIDGE AND THEY PROMPTLY SANK IN MID STREAM
700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT UPON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NO DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY SEEMING LIKE AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAIDEN
700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHAT HAD THE GIRLS GONE
700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF THE GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES TO HER
700-122868-0023 I SHIRLEY
700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET ON THERE HE EXCLAIMED
700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES
700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MISSUS
700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING IN HIS OARS
700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT IN THE BARGE I MEAN THE FLOOD
700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT AUNT HESITATED
700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK FIERCE LITTLE BEAT
700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
700-122868-0033 OH RIGHT
700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNE SHIRLEY AND I DIDN'T CARE EITHER
700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD CONSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL
700-122868-0036 EVERY THING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS TO ESCAPE
700-122868-0037 MAY'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO DO
700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANNE GROANED LAURA
700-122868-0039 I DON'T SAY HOW SAID LAURA
700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF SOME GREATER SHORTCOMING
7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF SCORNING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IPSOPHYLICITAS SAE NISITEMPERAT PREMITE EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND TO CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM WITH THE TAIL METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE IS SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVES FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THE SHARP VIVACITY OF THE SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS
7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIVES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR LESS WEIGHT
7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNATURAL PEOPLE AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAINING WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE
7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER FOR THE ILLS OF A LONG PIECE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR
7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF OTHER YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PAY
7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSE TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHEN PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE HONOURS DELAYED FROM THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
7601-101622-0005 LET PEACE'S BLOOD STAIN THE INFAMOUS ARENA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND TO DIE BRAVELY BUT TERRIBLELY TOO INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR DEATH
7601-101622-0007 THE VERY CREATURES THEMSELVES SET THEM ON
7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING OF REVOLT AND
7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND HIS SURPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARD THE FORWARD
7601-175351-0002 LIGHT OUR FIRES EXCLAIMED SOME
7601-175351-0003 WHY WITH ASKED OTHERS
7601-175351-0004 AND STUFFE THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED WARREN
7601-175351-0005 DID HE HEAR ME
7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE CRIED PATTERAS
7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PANN ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN
7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED PENN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANYTHING FURTHER
7601-175351-0009 YOU SHAN'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEN THEY SHAN'T LIGHT THE FIRES
7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN THE CABIN AND GUARDED
7601-175351-0011 A MURMUR WAS SEEN
7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOBER AND WARREN WENT DOWN TO HIS POST
7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERED AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROWLE
7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BARRING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWD TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERRATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
7601-175351-0015 I' AM BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WALL
7601-175351-0016 HATTERAS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL AS MISTER EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS APOCRYPHAL
7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WERE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOURS AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURES HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK BRAVING THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
7601-175351-0021 THERE' IS MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO IMITATE THEM I THINK
7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAWBONNY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK OUR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED WELL
7601-175351-0024 THEY CERTAINLY WILL MISTER CLAWBONNY
7601-175351-0025 I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE TO
7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRIMNELL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITANNIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHORED THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCYDIDES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HINTS WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE A SERVANT THAT THIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE CHIEF SUBJECTS FOR THE HISTORIC PEN
7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES STRUGGLING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USEFUL VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES
7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AND APOTHEGMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SCOLIA OPINA
7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATUTES
7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKEJACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHER COCKS THAT TURNED AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONG HEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE POOR DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIVES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
7641-96252-0000 THUS IN DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS STILL THE SAME
7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES OF THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED THROUGH DOGMAS AND CUSTOMS
7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE WHEELS AND ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FULLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES ON ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BLONDS TO A FLEETING AND ILLUSIVE PHENOMENON
7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS SOUL IN EVERY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFERER
7641-96252-0008 BUT THE LATTER IS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE PRINCIPLE OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITE OF THE STAIN OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS A GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN A WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE GUARDS AS HIS OWN
7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE ITS POSITION A JOYFUL ONE YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SERENITY OF DISPOSITION
7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO UNUSUAL MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE
7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALIZE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNES
7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CAN NOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO AUGHT OR LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS HE CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERRING THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE OWN HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTWEIGH THE REGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
7641-96252-0017 SO DIE SOCRATES AND GIORDANO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTH SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HAND OF THE PRIESTS
7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY OF OUR OWN SELVES OR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE
7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPACITY FOR LOVE OR SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON IMAGINATION
7641-96252-0020 THEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THIS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISH OF DELIVERANCE
7641-96670-0000 THEY WERE IN THE LAND OF THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SESASTRAS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF AIA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN HER RISING AND SETTING
7641-96670-0002 MIDIA TOO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF KRETHEUS AND CRATHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMIS THEIR GRANDFATHER
7641-96670-0004 JAPSON TOOK PELIAS AND TELAMON WITH HIM
7641-96670-0005 AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHRYXUS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
7641-96670-0006 THE MISTS LIFTED AND BEFORE THEIR HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PALACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE CANNAEUS LIVED WITH OBSYRTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDEIA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS
7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEADA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FASSES
7641-96670-0010 WITH ME THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE
7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SRAMATTAI
7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES SHOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU
7641-96670-0013 ADAIR'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
7641-96670-0014 AND NOW SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID
7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER FOR THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE NOBLES
7641-96670-0017 THEN IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU
7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE KEEPING WITH HIM
7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HEAD
7641-96670-0020 KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF EIS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS
7641-96670-0021 THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH AND A DRAGON
7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THAT GOLDEN FLEECE
7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM OUR CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS ARMS UPON THE GROUND
7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS AS IT WAS
7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDIA GROW WIDE AND WITH FEAR
7641-96670-0027 PHRONTIS AND MELLUS WENT WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
7641-96684-0000 AND AS A POET APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETIS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING
7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED TO ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER ADMEETUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
7641-96684-0004 THE RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
7641-96684-0005 THE APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE OH APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID NEDMETUS
7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE IT WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ALMOST IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU WILL NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS ADMEDUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE UPON GO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON THE STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN ON HER MATTED HAIR
7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO AND DEATH
7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANXIOUS WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
7641-96684-0016 ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THIS KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
7641-96684-0017 THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE HUMAN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
7641-96684-0019 NOW THE BOOKS SEEMED TO STOP
7641-96684-0020 IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE WITH HIM AS BEFORE
7641-96684-0021 AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO TO DEATH IN HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR THEM
7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE
7641-96684-0024 SHE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
7641-96684-0025 NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM THEM
7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BEHIND THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD IS THAT CIRCUMSTANCE DUE
7641-96684-0028 AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER WAR WAS BEFORE HIM
7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GUARD OF THE UNDERWORLD
7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE HIS DEATH
7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THEME IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE TO HER HUSBAND
7641-96684-0032 HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND THEY WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM HIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING IT WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS WOULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGIN BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY
7641-96684-0037 THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I NEVER HAD PAINS ENOUGH
7641-96684-0038 THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOME
7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THEN HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAVE GONE TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIRS I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION
7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATES THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR GOD AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
7697-105815-0005 A CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS SON TO SWEEP IT
7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN THAT MEANS THIS
7697-105815-0008 THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COMING TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAY IT LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAUS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHEN IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRAVE ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CHRIST'S BLESSED TOMB
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WAS IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS WHITHER COME YOU AND WHERE DO WE GO
7697-105815-0014 FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT DALIN FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 KNOW YE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS THE THIEF
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE THE LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAY THEY NO DOUBT OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE'RE GETTING IN THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ARTS
7697-105815-0019 IS NOT OUR AGE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE IS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT ON THE HILL
7697-105815-0022 NOT HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMARU SAID THAT TSAYING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS COAT FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 YOU FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS ARROW
7697-105815-0028 OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHIUGH HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS HOPE
7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THAT TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHEN FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCRO
7697-105815-0033 HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREASTS OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAMB THE HILLS
7697-105815-0035 I THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRINGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HAUL AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE SENT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE THE WATCHFALL DWELT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO MORROW
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHON TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITHIN IT TO THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0043 HIGHTI COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU COULD ASK IT OF ME
7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT THIAR
7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEPTH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD
7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABE'S CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE
7697-105815-0048 CHARITY NOW WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR LET ME LEAVE THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN WALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN THE LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JOHN BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAIN AND THE STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIETH OF GATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIANS
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANNUS LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD YOU ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT SO LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THIS YOU SEE THE MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM ITS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID CHRIS AND LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE STREETS
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT IN THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAYING NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD
7697-105817-0008 CHRISTIAN WE MUST ALL STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SAID WE IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN THE FORT
7697-105817-0011 AND BY THIS AID WE CURE OUR SOULS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER A MAN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE UNIVERSE
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE A MAN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DISMAYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWEVER GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PRACTICE OF MEN AND OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAGE IT IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF THOSE ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET THE MOUNTAINS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THEIR PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE SAFE INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE A MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATE MEN IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEANEN OVER PLANS
7697-245712-0013 NOW I MEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNIC HAVE BEEN STERILE
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITYS
7697-245712-0016 IN EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTS OF NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THIS STATE OF INNOCENCE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MAN CAN BE CALLED MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THIS STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MEN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WILL HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF SCIENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE OR POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MATTER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT I HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN I WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS POOR CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE REFERENCE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN COULD INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I SHOULD SAY ANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY TO HIM SHE ASKED
8173-294714-0008 YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE FIRST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL YOURS
8173-294714-0009 WHAT THE WRONG ARE YOU TALKING OF
8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT CARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL
8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER REGRET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING ABOUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT A CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPY FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A DISPOSITION AS MINE
8173-294714-0016 A USELESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR THEIR FOOD AND SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE'S NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOW FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR HUSBAND
8173-294714-0021 THIS WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 NOW WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK
8173-294714-0025 SHE YIELDED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURES WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HAD HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATIONS YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 LET ME DECEIVE TO BE FORGIVEN
8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO BE YOUR ONLY BROTHER
8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE HAD PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HELP
8173-294714-0033 MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YES
8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF THE CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN FOR MISTER VAN BRANDT
8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF IT AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY NEED YOU HESITATED
8173-294714-0038 YOU SEE THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETIES
8173-294714-0039 THERE LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR MY GETTING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS DECISION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE IS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR DAYS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMEN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT A DIRECT INTEREST IN HIS DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE UNHAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS A MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASY AS I COULD MAKE IT
8173-294714-0048 YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN I EXCLAIMED
8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISSUS VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE
8173-294714-0051 I SEE NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SADLY
8173-294714-0052 WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY READERS
8173-294714-0053 THEY WERE TRUSTWORTHY AND EXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
8173-294714-0054 CAUTIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSED MYSELF HER MELANCHOLY TOOK THE ALARM
8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU WITH MISTER VAN BRANDT SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY
8173-294714-0056 I COULD HONESTLY PROMISE YOU THAT
8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM HIS KNOWLEDGE THE COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO WHILE MY RECOLLECTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
8173-294714-0059 KISS ME SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU LEAVE
8173-294714-0060 AND IT IS ONLY YOUR GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERS ME
8254-115543-0000 NEXT DAY EVERY BODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
8254-115543-0001 EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF FINAL ORDERS
8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING AND SCOLDING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGONS
8254-115543-0003 THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION WHEN AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OFF THROUGH THE GATEWAY
8254-115543-0004 BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER IN HER DOLLY DECK A SORT OF A LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SOWN BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES
8254-115543-0005 BESIDES THE FAMILIES THERE WERE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THE SLOW MOVING WAGON
8254-115543-0006 THE COOK TOO WENT WITH
8254-115543-0007 GOOD BY SHOUTED LITTLE KNOLL FROM HIS GARDEN WHILES THEY WENT BY GOOD BY
8254-115543-0008 THEY SHOUTED GREETINGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE POTTER AS THEY PASSED HIM AND ALSO TO THAT OLD FAKIR SMEARED ALL OVER WITH ASHES WHO SAT IN A LITTLE BRICK HUT BY THE BRIDGE AND PRETENDED TO MAKE WONDERFUL CURES
8254-115543-0009 THIS IS MORE FUN THAN GOING TO SCHOOL SAID CONLA AS THE OXEN PLODDED ALONG THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
8254-115543-0010 THESE LOVING BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS RUN QUITE WILD
8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG AT HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS
8254-115543-0012 AS THE WAGON CAME UP A YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THE HOLY MAN RAN UP AND HELD OUT A BEGGING BOWL SAYING GIVE CHARITABLE PEOPLE TO THIS HOLY ONE
8254-115543-0013 NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HATH SO MANY BEGGARS AS INDIA
8254-115543-0014 MANY OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY IN THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM
8254-115543-0015 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN UNDER THEM
8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THEY ARE DOGS SAID MAHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGARCANE DOWN BY THE STREAM
8254-115543-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN BUY SOME FROM THE MAN THAT HE IS NOW PLOUGHING BY THE STREAM SAID COLLA
8254-115543-0018 IT IS LOOKING FOR WATER SAID THE FARMER AS HE TOOK A LAST STALK OF CAIN AND GENTLY GUIDED IT DOWN TO THE STREAM
8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS ANOTHER FAVORITE ANIMAL OF THE HINDOOS AND THEY WOULD NOT KILL OR INJURE ONE FOR ANYTHING
8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GREY CLOUD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD
8254-115543-0021 IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING IN STATE ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJA OR RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS AND STATES OF WHICH MODERN INDIA WAS FORMERLY MADE UP
8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEMENT ALL DECORATED WITH SILK AND GOLD AND SILVER
8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS A HOWOUDAH WHICH WAS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS THE RAJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLOURED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN
8254-115543-0024 BEHIND THE HOWDAH STOOD A SERVANT HOLDING A BIG BUNDLE OF FINE FEATHERS OVER THE RAJAH'S HEAD
8254-115543-0025 THE DRIVER SAT ON THE NECK OF THE ELEPHANT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST BY PRODDING HIM AT ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN IRON SHOD STICK OR GOAD
8254-115543-0026 ISN'T IT FAIR TO RIDE LIKE THAT ON A BIG ELEPHANT
8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF A DAY THE LITTLE FOLK TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE GREAT RAJA AND HIS ESCORT
8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING ROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS AND BARGAINING FOR FOOD AT THE LITTLE BOOTH
8254-115543-0029 THESE THEY USED FOR PLATES HEAPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICES AND CURRY AND FISH AND ALL SORTS OF PUDDINGS AND SWEETS
8254-115543-0030 A SUPPER WAS BEING EATEN ANOTHER PARTY STOPPED AT THE PARAL ENCAMPED NOT FAR AWAY
8254-115543-0031 WHEN THE LITTER WAS PULLED DOWN A YOUNG BOY STEPPED OUT LOOKING VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY
8254-115543-0032 HIS SERVANTS AT ONCE SPREAD A HANDSOME RUG IN THE GROUND FOR HIM TO SIT ON AND RUSHED ABOUT WAITING ON HIM TAKING GOOD CARE TO KEEP EVERY ONE AT A DISTANCE
8254-115543-0033 YES AND NOW HE ORDERS EVERYONE ABOUT HIM
8254-115543-0034 AROUND THE LITTLE BRAHMAN'S NECK IS A THIN CORD OR THREAD WHICH IS THE SIGN OF HIS HIGH CASTE
8254-115543-0035 MEANWHILE THE HAUGHTY LITTLE BRAMIN ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HIS HEAD TURNED AWAY SO NO ONE COULD SEE HIM EAT AND THEN GROWING TIRED OF RESPECTFUL GLANCES AT THE CROWD AROUND HIM HE GOT INTO HIS LITTER AGAIN AND THE SERVANTS FASTENED THE CURTAINS TIGHTLY ROUND HIM
8254-115543-0036 EVERYBODY SLEPT SOUNDLY IN DESPITE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE SERVANTS WAS BEATING A DRUM MOST OF THE NIGHT WHICH THEY REALLY BELIEVED WAS THE WAY TO KEEP OFF EVIL SPIRITS
8254-115543-0037 OF THE THIEVES HE CRIED
8254-115543-0038 THEY RE AS BAD AS THE BEGGARS

8254-115543-0042 YOU'RE MY DOLLS SAID THE LITTLE GIRL SADLY AS SHE PATTED THE BUNDLE BESIDE HER
8254-115543-0043 I TAKE THIS AS AN OFFERING TO THE HOLY RIVER POOR LITTLE WOMAN
