116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD THE BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WENDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT DARK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I EXTENDED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT BLANKLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY BRIDE
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED AND CONDUCT THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AN IDOL I WHISPERED TAKEN BY SURPRISE A
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPPED GODS THAT WOULD NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAMORS IN MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NO I SAID A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HERE WAS AN IDOL THEN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 IT MADE ATHENS A CITY OF LIGHT IT CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR VISION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT INTERRUPTED MY GUIDE THAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANSWER WOULD BE IT WAS SO TRUE
116-288045-0014 TRODUCE HIM
116-288045-0015 I WHISPERED TO MYSELF WHAT BLASPHEMYS
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S ARDENT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNING THE DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT THE HOMER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM AND HOMER THE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO NO NOW APOLLO IS NOT AN IDOL
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD TO THE SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE THE VARIOUS LAMPS AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MIEN OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT THE PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH DAY OF THE BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH A SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS WORDS
116-288045-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH HORSE HE WAS ONLY AN IDOL
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWERING TO HIS NAME OR DISPOSITION
116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTED TURNING TOWARDS HIM
116-288045-0027 WILL HE NOT BE HERE THIS NIGHT
116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPES I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASP HIS DIVINE FACE TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH A WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF AN IDOL AS APOLLO IS
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY CAN NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE ITS TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CANNIED DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN A MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY GIVE FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERY THING WHICH IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IT IS BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE DID NOT BUILD UP IS ANOTHER CRITICISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OR NO PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTH IN A JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF THE STUDENT IS A BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRINSELL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RITES POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRINCE
116-288046-0009 I WISH SHE WOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 BUT FIRST LET US BE IMPERSONAL THE EPITHETS IRREVERENT BLASPHEMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL OR FLUNG AT A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM ENVY
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOUR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WETTING THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST ANIMATED BY THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVES OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BY CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 A MYTH IS OF FANCIEL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MIND CRAVES FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF HER INBORN DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSE ENOUGH NOT TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS METHOS THE PRIMITIVE MAN WAS SATISFIED UNTIL HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE RECOGNIZED ITS INADEQUACY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALIZATION
116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED WOMAN LIVING IN INDIA HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE HINDUS
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MY EYES HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JESUS AND MYTH
116-288047-0007 THERE IS IN MAN A FACULTY FOR VICTION
116-288047-0008 BUT IT THINKS LESS THAN IT GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BITE INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURBING ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RELENTLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FILL THE SPACE OF ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE AND AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 I COVET THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET DO NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF A DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN ALTHOUGH MAN HAD MATURED
116-288047-0014 THAT GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND THIS OF MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THIS SCHOOL IS THE BIRTHPLACE IN SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SCIENCE OF THE LORD
116-288047-0018 OF THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 SHE IS GOD'S MOUTHPIECE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT HAS TO BE REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE EYES OF THE EVIDENCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOR IN HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR A REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DATES WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES AS THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPELS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNKNOWN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 IT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 WHY WAS DISCREPANCY IN THE HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT AND LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THEIR MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS ABOUT JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHILE IT IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY APPEARS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATIONS TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN AND THE ZODIAC AND PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN AUSTRALEA HAS BECOME THE CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE OREGING OFFERS THE FOLLOWING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SCEPTICAL CELSUS ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISTS OF MISSUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE OTHER HANDS AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MARY WHO WAS MARK
116-288048-0012 WE WERE JOHN PETER JUDAS AND MARY
116-288048-0013 BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME FOR A NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THAT PRESENCE OF A MYTH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE ALMOST EXQUISITELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DOES NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN IN AN CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 HOW ELSE IS THE UNANIMOUS SILENCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VIRTUES
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BY THE SWORD NOT AND BY HELL FIRE HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 THAT THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JUDAS MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO NIGHT NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THEY PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF DELUDED MORTALS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH ABSOLUTE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH THE PREACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARRIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT THEY ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WILL HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MEAN YOU WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE PHILOSOPHY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT DESTROY FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR METEOR OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUD OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF EVERYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR IRREGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUNDS WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG AFTER A FORM FORMED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HIGH
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN FOUR INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONE
1255-138279-0008 TWO P THREE
1255-138279-0009 OR FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPES ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED STILLER
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH FIELD
1255-138279-0013 THE WATER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDDLELAND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW WAS JUST AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WALL
1255-138279-0016 OH SAID THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I ASKED AND WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 THOUGH I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 OH NOT I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 OH I HAVE MONEY
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WANT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I KNOW
1255-138279-0023 THE FACTS IS I FORGOT TO ASK
1255-138279-0024 GOOD EVENING FRANK GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 YOUR THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNTESS NEVER GAVE WAY THE INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH WE RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHALL NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BEGGED FOR ONE DELAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THAT BEGAN TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE ON THEM
1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR ARMS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENTS AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LOVELL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THEY'RE POLES ASUNDER FOR ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHERS
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT A SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THAT MASTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 AND WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER THWAITE SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT HIS SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 TO HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YE SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN A LASS
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE HAD A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I'D SOONER SEE YOU DARN MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEETHEARTY
1255-74899-0021 I SHOULD DO THAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AND NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER FOR MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 BUT HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE WIND GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE INQUIRED QUIETLY
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE NOT KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU SEE ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 AN I SHOULD THINK SO
1255-90407-0006 HE'S MY FATHER SAID
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA COUNCIL ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER'S IS LIKE A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 OR HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'VE HEARD SUCH
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH ON HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR AN EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 HE WAS THAT THIS EVENING
1255-90407-0014 THERE ON THE NITS THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPELETS
1255-90407-0016 NO I MUST GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO EARLY THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 ON THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL
1255-90407-0019 I HAD NOT REALISED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE STEADIED HER GRADUALLY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT HAD ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE CARRIAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS STILL IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND ME UP SOMETHING TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND DOING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENTS
1255-90407-0027 YOU' ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PEARSON
1255-90407-0028 HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAS BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARING OF THIS ATTIRE
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVAS CARRO
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS CLOSES AND SATISFIES
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINEAVNA'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART FOR AWHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WAS NOT OVER
1255-90413-0004 BUT WAS WE ABLE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DESIRED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY IN THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONHURST SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELLOOOL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HER GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD HEIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND KNOCKED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD A ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HEAD SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU BE LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED OF SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS TOO RATHER UNCIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE COULD NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANTTLECLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSCELYN AND PIERSON
1255-90413-0019 OH DIDN'T HE KNOW HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINESAVAN WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOWER'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICOLA PINE AVEN
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL THEN
1255-90413-0024 AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED ON FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS INTO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRINGS IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JOSCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR A TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO REPRESENT AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURES OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE FACE OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSING COSTS OF PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESOLVE IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APACHES OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD AND NOT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LADDERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSOLVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN THE RIGHTENING FAST
1585-131718-0007 YES THE VERY VOGUAL OF THE ELECTRIC HEART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENT ARCTURING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR THE STREET LINING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CUREST MANNERS THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRING THOUGHT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY FIVE PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY APPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARCLIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANY'S AND THE LEADING CITIES
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONGED OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MORE BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ACLEYDE BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN HE IS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HUNDREDS OF SITTERS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PRODUCES ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IT IN NEW YORK ITSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OBJECTS OF WHICH THERE WERE PLENTY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH AN ACTIVE ILL WILL
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENOA INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT THE GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM AND THE BALLASTO WATTGAGE
1585-131718-0023 THEY SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY FIVE CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED IT ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER LOOKING ROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLUE HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 I THEN HAD MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY
1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO ADDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AN IMPORTING IN A CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HAM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOWWORK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE PARADES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WORCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMBERED OTHER DETAILS
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLYS COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOWROOMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS THE PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUES TO COMMERCE
1585-131718-0033 THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS ALSO STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A'T
1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AND SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEE HIVE DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARNOCLET OF THE PARK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I SHOULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SECRES AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND OH PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM ON WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT
1585-131718-0040 I I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBER THINKING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO DEIGN NOTICE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMONIS
1585-131718-0044 HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOL
1585-131718-0045 ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHT FOR HIS VIOLIN
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIBRYGATE
1585-131718-0048 HE WOULD GO DOWN AMONG THE FIRE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLERS DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAND FACTORY IN THE YARDS AS HE WAS LEAVING
1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS UNWING FIRST
1585-131718-0051 I HAVE NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST A COLD
1585-131718-0052 THEN THEY GOT PLEURACEA AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF FACTING ADDISONS EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS NOT REQUIRED
1585-157660-0000 LONDON ITS GOUT AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MEN ARE MOADED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND OF THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE OLD STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAMS STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UTTERED THE FOLLOWING ORRITORICAL FLOOD
1585-157660-0003 BUT GLORIOUS LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WONDERFUL ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEAT HIM SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNING COUCHS
1585-157660-0006 WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERING AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE IN FOLDING ARMS OF MORPHUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIGHTS OF THE SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXPECTATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPORTATIONS FOULTS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST EE PROMISES AND OFT HE HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLITS
1585-157660-0009 DOSIS ONE DUBIL WHEN SIX IS TREBACOY
1585-157660-0010 WILLEM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE SCINOPOT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION
1585-157660-0011 THE POLITE YOUTH REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE A WORD FOR IT
1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON THAT CASTE AND WOULD WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BU PAPS AS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD JUMPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROC
1585-157660-0015 THE PREEN'S SHOP OF FAR WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVERN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES BURRIBRIDGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS PLOD MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLER AND INEFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WORST
1630-102884-0002 THEY HAVE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENACIOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE VAST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDES OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST JOIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THESE ACQUIRED A TRUE LOVE OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT EPOCH OF THE SOUL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHABBADA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS STIRRED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEEP
1630-102884-0009 IT HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT CONSTRUCTOR
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ODOR WHICH PROVED ITS HABITUAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR VICE FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 BY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GRIP OF A INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE AND GROWTH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING SOULS INTO A PERMANENT PASSIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEIR OWN INTRINSICK DESIGN AND OF MASTERING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING OUR STEPS FOR AGES CANNOT BE BUT A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY SHALL BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND OF FIGHTING IN FREEDOM'S CAUSE
1630-102884-0016 IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF INERTIA WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUTH AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO LIBERTY BOTH WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND OUTSIDE
1630-141772-0000 ON THE PRAEDZEN HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAGSTAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND CHILDLIKE MOAN
1630-141772-0001 SUDDENLY HE AGAIN FELT THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BURNING LACERATING PAIN IN HER HEAD
1630-141772-0002 THERE WAS HIS FIRST THOUGHT
1630-141772-0003 HE FEEBLY MOVED HIS LEG AND UTTERED A HUGE SICKLY GROAN WHICH AROUSED HIS OWN PITY
1630-141772-0004 LIFT A YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TERRIBLE PAIN OF BEING LIFTED ON TO A STRETCHER THE JOLTING WHILE BEING MOVED AND THE PROBING OF HIS WOUNDS AT THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0006 DURING THIS TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN LOOK
1630-141772-0007 WHO ASKED ON SEEING THE PRISONERS
1630-141772-0008 I COMMAND IT AS SQUADRON REPLIED REPNON
1630-141772-0009 PRINCE REPNIN NAMED LIEUTENANT SUCTELLAN
1630-141772-0010 AS AFTER LOOKING AT HIM NAPOLEON SMILED
1630-141772-0011 YOUTH IS NO HINDRANCE TO COURAGE MUTTERED SUCTILAND IN A FAILING VOICE
1630-141772-0012 A SPLENDID REPLY SAID NAPOLEON AND
1630-141772-0013 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYES TO COMPARE THE SHOW OF PRISONERS COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHONE WITH SELF SATISFACTIONS AND PLEASURE
1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD ICORN PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER FATHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOR THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY NOW HASTENED TO RETURN THE HOLY IMAGE
1630-141772-0016 MISTER ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED BUT THE LITTLE ICON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT UD BE TO KNOW WHERE TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THEIR GRAVE
1630-141772-0018 HOW HAPPY AND CALM I SHOULD BE IF I COULD NOW SAY LORD HAS MERCY ON ME
1630-141772-0019 EITHER TO A POWER INDEFINABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHICH I NOT ONLY CANNOT ADDRESS BUT WHICH I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS IN WORDS THE GREAT ALL OR NOTHING SAID HE TO HIMSELF OR TO THAT GOD WHO HAS BEEN SOWN INTO THAT AMULET BY MARY
1630-141772-0020 THE STRETCHING MOVED ON
1630-141772-0021 THE QUIET HOME LIFE AND PEACEFUL HAPPINESS OF BOULD HILL PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM
1630-141772-0022 HE HAS A NERVOUS BILIOUS SUBJECT SAID LARRY AND WILL NOT RECOVER
1630-73710-0000 IT IS IN THE FOOT OF WOMAN THAT WE LAY THE LAURELS THAT WITHOUT HER SMILE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GAINED IT IS HER IMAGE THAT STRINGS THE LYRE OF THE POET THAT ANIMATES HER VOICE IN THE BLAZE OF ELOQUENT FACTION AND GUIDES HER BRAIN IN THE AUGUST TOILS OF STATELY COUNCILS
1630-73710-0001 IS THERE NO HOPE FOR THEM SO FULL A HOPE
1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE BUT TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO OUR IMAGINATION
1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCUR FLITS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OBSCURING ALL OUR GAY FANCIES WITH ITS BAT LIKE WING OR TAINTING THE HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF HER HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPIRATIONS
1630-73710-0004 MINE MINE OWN
1630-73710-0005 NOT DEAD WHAT COULD YOU DO
1630-73710-0006 I BET ABOUT MY CHAMBER LIKE A FILLIE BIRD IN A CAGE
1630-73710-0007 DO NOT THINK OF MOVING TO BED
1630-73710-0008 AND DO NOT KEEP THE MESSENGER AN INSTANT
1630-73710-0009 KISS OUT MY PONY
1630-73710-0010 WRITE ONLY ONE WORD TO YOUR HONOUR HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0011 FOORDNANT TO HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0012 GOD BLESSS YOU MY HENRIETTA MY BELOVED MY MATCHLESS HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0013 WHAT HAS THAT THE SEPARATION NOT COST ME
1630-73710-0014 PANGS THAT I COULD NOT CONCEIVE ANY HUMAN MISERY TO OCCASION
1630-73710-0015 AND YET I HAVE OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT HE WAS UNINJURED LAST NIGHT
1630-73710-0016 I DARE NOT NOW OWN HOW FOOLISH I FELT
1630-73710-0017 DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOU HENRIETTA BUT I'M NERVOUS ABOUT CONCEALING YOUR ENGAGEMENT FROM PAPA
1630-73710-0018 DAYS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE YOU CAN REACH BATH AND I HOPE FERDINAND I KNOW YOUR OFFICE IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WILL CONFESS
1630-73710-0019 BUT COME BACK MY OWN AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND WRITE TO ME AT THE POST OFFICE AS YOU'S SETTLED
1630-73710-0020 THE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU ARE SO NEAR MAKES ME RESTLESS
1630-73710-0021 I WISH TO MEET HIM WITH AS MUCH CARELESSNESS AS I CAN COMMAND
1630-96099-0000 THAT TOO SINCE YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERTAKE
1630-96099-0001 THEY SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HE HAS SOME SPECIAL INFORMATION SOME GREAT NEWS
1630-96099-0002 WHEN BLOCH APPEARED IT WAS APPARENT THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH HIM
1630-96099-0003 GONE NOW JUST WHEN WE MOST WARNED YOU NEVER
1630-96099-0004 ETIATE TRIPLE EDIAT
1630-96099-0005 YOU SHALL BE DISMISSED DISCHARGED FROM THE CZAR YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO THE PEACE
1630-96099-0006 IT WAS THAT O YOUR GREAT GLUTTONY
1630-96099-0007 MY GENTLEMAN MADE HIMSELF MOST PLEASED
1630-96099-0008 WELL AT ANY RATE FOR MY SINS I RECEIVED
1630-96099-0009 WE ENTERED THE FIRST RESTAURANT THAT OF THE REUNITED TRENDS YOU KNOW IT PERHAPS MONSIEURS
1630-96099-0010 I HAD NO FEAR OF HIM NOT TILL THE VERY LAST WHEN HE PLAYED ME THIS NOBLE TURN
1630-96099-0011 I SUSPECTED NOTHING WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT HIS POCKET BOOK IT WAS STUFFED FULL MESSIEUR I SAW THAT AND MY CONFERENCE INCREASED CALLED FOR THE RECKONING AND PAID WITH AN ITALIAN BANK
1630-96099-0012 EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT PRAY'
1630-96099-0013 HE WENT OUT MESSIERS AND PIFF PATH HE WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN
1630-96099-0014 OH LET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
1630-96099-0015 IT WAS ONLY NOW AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR THAT THE ITALIAN HAD BECOME INCULPATED AND THE QUESTION OF HIS POSSIBLE ANXIETY TO ESCAPE HAD NEVER BEEN UNDERSTOOD
1630-96099-0016 HE FOUND EVERYTHING BEHIND
1630-96099-0017 HAND IT TO ME SAID THE CHIEF AND WHEN IT CAME IN TO HIS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES HURRIEDLY
1630-96099-0018 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND BUT MORE THAN A WORD HERE AND THERE
1630-96099-0019 IT IS NO DOUBT IT ITALIAN
1630-96099-0020 OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WOULD NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD BUT OF MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE
1630-96099-0021 IT WAS A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED LIER A HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS HA
1630-96099-0022 HE WAS MUCH SURPRISED IN A GREAT HURRY
1630-96099-0023 DIRECTLY HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED THE DEAD
1630-96099-0024 HE WISHED TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT THEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE AND WERE DRIVEN AWAY TOGETHER
1650-157641-0000 THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARD SMOKING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME AFTERWARD WAS CURIOUS
1650-157641-0001 NOW MISSUS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IN A SMOKING HUMOUR AND SHALL PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHTS
1650-157641-0002 BUT SEE HOW YOU ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU
1650-157641-0003 THE DWARFS'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE CATHOLIC
1650-157641-0004 BUT QUILP AND BRASS WERE NOW IN SOLITUDE
1650-157641-0005 THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF THE ACTIVE OPONENTS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO
1650-157641-0006 ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THE GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATES SMOKINGS AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR SMOKING AMONG OFFICERS OF THE ARMY
1650-157641-0007 THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ADOOR OF TOBACCO AND THE DISTRUSTED THE MAN WHO SMOKED
1650-157641-0008 HERE IS FISTPUTTO'S OR THACKERAY'S COMMENT ON IT WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
1650-157641-0009 I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT THE MEN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RIVAL
1650-157641-0010 I WOULD LAY A GUINEA BUT THE MANLY LADY WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I AM A SMOKER AND SAYS O THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE
1650-157641-0011 GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR THREESCORE YEARS FRANCE SMOKES TO HER MAN
1650-157641-0012 PSHA LOOK AT THIS PROGRESS
1650-157641-0013 THUS THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS ALL BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
1650-157641-0014 THE JOURNALISTS AND THE BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THEIR CODGERS WERE ABOUT WERE BELOW THE BIG TASTE OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS
1650-157641-0015 BOTH QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE PRINCE CONSLOR DETESTED IT AS TOBACCO WAS TABOO WHEREVER THE COURT WAS
1650-167613-0000 THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE AND THE PRINCE ANDREW APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA
1650-167613-0001 SEAS WERE BROUGHT IN AND SO WAS THE THIRD
1650-167613-0002 THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT THE PEER'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF THE MAUSICOTE AND THE POSITION OF OUR ARMY FROM WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN
1650-167613-0003 SO WILL YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS
1650-167613-0004 NOW BEING A MILITARY MAN YOU CAN'T SAY I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL PROPOSITION
1650-167613-0005 WELL THEN YOU KNOW NO MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE BE IT WHO IT MAY SAID PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0006 AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BACLAY DE TOE
1650-167613-0007 PURE LOOKED AT MALCOLM WITH THE CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH EVERYBODY INVOLUNTARILY DRESSED THAT OFFICER

1650-167613-0014 WHILE RUSSIA WAS WELL A FOREIGNER COULD SERVE HER AND BE AS SPLENDID A MINISTER BUT AS SOON AS SHE IS IN DANGER SHE NEEDS ONE OF HER OWN KIN
1650-167613-0015 AND THEY SAY HE IS A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REJOINED HIS PEER

1650-167613-0021 SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ON NEIGHBORS AND THE LEAST OF ALL ON POSITIONS BUT ON WHAT THEN
1650-167613-0022 ON THE FEELING THAT'S IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMALKIN AND HE IS SOLDIER
1650-167613-0023 THE LATTER IS WON BY THOSE WHO FIRMLY RESOLVE TO WIN IT

1650-167613-0028 THE FACT IS THAT THOSE MEN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE RIDDEN ROUND THE POSITIONS NOT ONLY TO NOW HELP MATTERS BUT TO HINDER

1650-167613-0042 HE PACED UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES IN SILENCE BUT HIS EYES GLITTERED FEVERISHLY AND HIS LIPS QUIVERED AS IF HE BEGAN SPEAKING
1650-167613-0043 AND THAT WHEN THERE WAS A WAR LIKE THIS ONE IT WOULD BE A WAR
1650-167613-0044 WHAT'S NEEDED FOR SUCCESS IN WARFARE

1650-167613-0052 NO HE DOES NOT WANT IT SO PIERRE CONCLUDED
1650-167613-0053 AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR FIRST MEETING
1650-167613-0054 ONE PICTURE SUCCEEDED TO ANOTHER IN HIS IMAGINATION
1650-167613-0055 ON ONE OF EM HE DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY
1650-173551-0000 HIS MAJORDOMO CAME IN A SECOND TIME TO SAY THAT A FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THE LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND THAT SOME ONE FROM BOZZETEV'S WIDOW HAD A COW TO ASK PIERRE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOK AS SHE HERSELF WAS LEAVING FOR THE COUNTRY
1650-173551-0001 BUT THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE PASSAGE
1650-173551-0002 THE HAL PORTERS WAS STANDING AT THE FRONT DOOR
1650-173551-0003 FROM THE LANDING WHERE I STOOD THERE WAS A SECOND STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE BACK ENTRANCE
1650-173551-0004 HE WENT DOWN THIS STAIRCASE AND OUT INTO THE YARD NO ONE HAS SEEN HIM
1650-173551-0005 WHEN HE FELT THAT HE WAS BEING LOOKED AT HE BEHAVED LIKE AN OSTERBAGE WHICH HIDE HIS HEAD IN A BUSH IN ORDER NOT TO BE SEEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND QUICKENING HIS PACE WENT DOWN THE STREET
1650-173551-0006 HE HIRED THE FIRST A CAB HE MET AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE PATRIOX'S POUNCE WHERE THE WIDOW BALSITIVE'S HOUSE WAS
1650-173551-0007 THIS WAS THE AUTHENTIC SCOTCH ACTS WITH PATHE'S NOTES AND EXCLAMATIONS
1650-173551-0008 HE SATE DOWN AT THE DUSTY WRITING TABLE AND HAVING LAID THE MANUSCRIPT BEFORE HIM OPENED THEM OUT CLOSED THEM FINALLY PUSHED THEM AWAY AND RESTING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND SANK INTO MENDICATION
1650-173551-0009 MAKARY ALEXEYVITCH CAME TWICE THAT EVENING SHUFFLING ALONG IN HIS GLASHES AS FAR AS THE DOOR AND STOPPED AND LOOKED INGRATIATEDLY AT PIERRE
1650-173552-0000 AT THAT VERY TIME AT TEN IN THE MORNING OF THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER NAPOLEON WAS STANDING AMONG HIS TROOPS ON THE PYRALONIAN HEEL LOOKING AT THE PANORAMAS SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM
1650-173552-0001 THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE MORNING WAS MAGICICAL
1650-173552-0002 BUT MY CLEMENCY IS ALWAYS READY TO DESCEND UPON THIS VANQUISHED
1650-173552-0003 YET HERE SHE IS LYING AT MY FEET WITH HER GOLDEN DOMES AND CROSSES SINGULLATING IN A TWINKLING IN THE SUNSHINE
1650-173552-0004 BUT THEN I SHALL SPARE HER
1650-173552-0005 FROM THE HIDE OF THE KREMELIN YES THE YEAR IS THE KREMELIN YES I WILL GIVE THEM JUST A LOUSE I WILL TEACH THEM THE MEANING OF TRUE CIVILISATION I WILL MAKE GENERATIONS OF BOYARS REMEMBER THEIR CONQUEROR WITH LAW
1650-173552-0006 I WILL TELL THE DEPUTATION THAT I DENOUNT AND DO NOT DESIRE WAR THAT I'LL WAGE THE WAR ONLY AGAINST THE FALSE POLICY OF THEIR COURT THAT I LOVE AND RESPECT ALEXANDER AND THAT IN MASSACRE I WILL ACCEPT TERMS OF PEACE WORTHY OF MYSELF AND OF MY PEOPLE
1650-173552-0007 I DO NOT WISH TO UTILIZE THE FORTUNES OF WAR TO HUMILIATE AND ALARM THE MONARCH
1650-173552-0008 HE WILL HAVE TO BE TOLD ALL THE SAME SAYS A GENTLEMAN OF THE SUITE BUT GENTLEMEN
1650-173552-0009 A SINGLE REPORT OF THE SICKENING GUN FOLLOWED AND THE TROOPS WHO WERE ALREADY SPREAD OUT ON DIFFERENT SIDE SOUTH MOSCOW MOVED INTO THE CITY THROUGH VORD KOLOUGA AND DARGOMLEVKA
1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER FOR WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED A MAJESTIC TEACHER OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH HE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH HE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS COMPOSED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WERE TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO NAME IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN AT NIGHT UPON MY BED SIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FINISHED ITS TITLE
1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMBLED TOGETHER IN AS AWED A MANNER AS HE SHOULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE EFFECT
1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS JOHNSON'S ABBREVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD IS CONCERNED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING SCHEME
1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF BAD HABITS NEGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE AND ALL CHANGED BY TIME
1651-136854-0008 A CONFIDENCE OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING AS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
1651-136854-0009 THE YOUTH AMBITIOUS AS THINKING HONOURS EASY TO BE HAD
1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KINDS OF A PRAISE PURSUED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCIUM MANHOOD
1651-136854-0012 WAY
1651-136854-0013 IN SCHOLAR'S FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADIES
1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO MAN BY WORDS REPELLED BY PASSIONATES
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY APPEAR
1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY HINDERS COMPLIANCE IT
1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCES INSOLENCE AND AN ENVY
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD IN EACH TO MY PRIVATE INTEREST TOO LITTLE
1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH THEIR SUPERIORS EVERY ONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN MIND
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY ONLY UNITED SCARCE EVER WITHOUT CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 AND COMPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MANY AGAINST FIVE
1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO WRONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF THE WORTHY MEN
1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER BUT HAVE A MORE READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE HAND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GUARD AND EXCITE AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVED THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN USEFUL WISE AND INNOCENT AND A DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND WHOLLY
1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENIES YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MIGHT INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOGNITION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 NO THIRTY TWO IN PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANT OF STOICISM AS THE SUN OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENTENCES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF THE LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRATES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABBLER TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT IN THE LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAVE FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTERWOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES DIFFER AS THE PLAIN CLOTH AND BROCADE
1686-142278-0000 BUT HE WAS GONE
1686-142278-0001 NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES OR CRIMSON AND AMBER TENTS
1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK A HAPPY SKETCHING CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN
1686-142278-0003 HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCTS HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF ITS BRIEF SUCCESS AND ALL THE SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECTS OF HIS DESIRES OH DEAR
1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WHIRL OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO SOMETHING LIKE ORDER
1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALEY SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD THE RESPONSES ALL TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0006 SHE FORGOT THAT HE HAD NOT MADE IT AN OFFER
1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING BED TIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY
1686-142278-0008 LONG
1686-142278-0009 I ONLY WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0010 BE VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER AFTER OUR REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT THE FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT STOP FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTURBING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0015 BUT WHY DEAR PAPA DO CALL ME
1686-142278-0016 BECAUSE I MUST NO LONGER BE A MINISTER FOR THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
1686-142278-0017 AS NOTHING TO THE SHOCK SHE RECEIVED FROM MISTER HALE'S LAST SPEECH WHAT COULD HE MEAN
1686-142278-0018 IT WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR BEING SO MISERABLE
1686-142278-0019 WHY HOW CAN YOU NO LONGER BE A CLERGYMAN
1686-142278-0020 SURELY IF THE BISHOP WERE TOLD ALL WE KNOW ABOUT FREDERICK AND HIS HARD AND JUST
1686-142278-0021 MARGARET I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THEM
1686-142278-0022 I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS ONCE BUT AFTER TO NIGHT LET US NEVER THINK OF IT AGAIN
1686-142278-0023 I CAN METE THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY PAINFUL MISERABLE DOUBTS FOR IT IS AN EFFORT BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING
1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION NOT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY IN THAT HE PAUSED
1686-142278-0025 MARGARET SIGHED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEW POWER
1686-142278-0026 MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE HOLY CHURCH FROM WHICH I AM TO BE SHUT UP
1686-142278-0027 HE COULD NOT GO DOWN FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
1686-142278-0028 MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WERE ABOUT TO RETURN MAHOMETIAN
1686-142278-0029 THIS ONE STAYED FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING
1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE CAUSE ON WHICH HE WAS NOW INVOLVED
1686-142278-0031 LISTEN DEAR MARGARET SAID HE TURNING ONE ARM ROUND HER WAIST
1686-142278-0032 WHEN GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND YET HE WILL ON ANOTHER
1686-142278-0033 IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT AN ORDER TO HIS CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY
1686-142278-0034 AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE WHAT HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING
1686-142278-0035 I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACH THAT WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MAN LESS TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE
1686-142278-0036 HE SHOOK ITS HEAD AS HE WENT ON
1686-142278-0037 MARGARET I TRIED TO DO IT BUT I TRIED TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THE ADDITIONAL PREFERMENT AND STOPPING QUIETLY HERE STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
1686-142278-0038 GOD FORGIVE ME NOW
1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING LOW WORDS OF SELF REPROACH AND HUMILIATION OR WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT A FEW
1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD SAID BURDENS WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE
1686-142278-0041 EXCEPT

1686-142278-0043 THEY ARE NOT WHAT I HAVE TRIED UPON MYSELF WITHOUT A VEIL
1686-142278-0044 THAT WILL BE A TRIAL BUT WORSE FAR WORSE WILL BE THIS DEPARTING FROM MY DEAR PEOPLE
1686-142278-0045 HE WILL COME TO STAY WITH US TO DINNER

1686-142278-0051 SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED AS THE FORCE OF THAT BLOW RETURNED UPON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALISE HOW ANOTHER WOULD TAKE IT
1686-142278-0052 TO MILTON NORTHERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DULL INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENEST OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER MIND
1686-142278-0053 MILTON NORTHERN MEN

1686-142278-0055 BUT HE WITH HIS QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ INTO HER FACE AS IN A MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNED IT OFF WITH AN EFFORT

1701-141759-0003 EACH TIME THAT THESE HINTS CAME TO MAKE THE COUNTESS ANXIOUS AND SHE GLANCED UNEASILY AT THE COUNT AND AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA THE LATTER VERY ADROITLY TURNED THE CONVERSATION TO INSIGNIFICANT MATTERS

1701-141759-0021 SONYA SMILES AND NO

1701-141759-0025 ON RETIRING TO HER OWN ROOM SHE SAT IN AN ARMCHAIR HER EYES FIXED ON A MINIATURE PORTRAIT OF HER SON AND THE LID OF A SNUFF BOX WHILE THE TEARS KEPT COMING INTO HER EYES
1701-141759-0026 THE COUNT PUT HIS EAR INTO THE KEYHOLE AND LISTENED
1701-141759-0027 AT FIRST HE HEARD THE SOUND OF INDIFFERENT VOICES THEN ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S VOICE ALONE IN A LONG SPEECH THEN A CRY AND SILENCE THEN BOTH VOICES TOGETHER WITH GLAD INTONATIONS AND THEN FOOTSTEPS
1701-141759-0028 ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OPENED THE DOOR OH
1701-141759-0029 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS SONYA BLUSHED SO THAT TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES AND UNABLE TO BEAR THE LOOKS TURNED UPON HER RAN AWAY INTO THE DANCING HALL WHIRLED ROUND IT AT FULL SPEED WITH HER DRESS PUFFED OUT LIKE THE BALLOON AND FLUSHED AND SMILING PLUMPED DOWN ON THE FLOOR
1701-141759-0030 THE COUNTESS WAS WALKING
1701-141759-0031 FROM ALL HE SAYS ONE SHOULD BE BAD AND NOT CRY

1701-141760-0001 THE GUARDS HAS MADE THEIR WHOLE MARCH AS IF ON A PLEASURE TRIP PARADING THEIR CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE
1701-141760-0002 THE REGIMENTS HAD ENTERED AND LEFT THE TOWN WITH THEIR BANDS PLAYING AND BY THE GRAND DUKE'S ORDERS THE MEN HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY IN STEPPES A PRACTISE ON WHICH THE GUARDS PRIDED THEMSELVES THE OFFICERS ON FOOT AND AT THEIR PROPER POSTS

1701-141760-0004 BORIS DURING THE CAMPAIGN HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MANY PERSONS WHO MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO HIM AND BY A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION HE HAD BROUGHT FROM PIERRE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI THOUGH WHOM HE HOPED TO OBTAIN A POST UPON THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF STAFF
1701-141760-0005 BERG AND BORIS HAVING RESTED AFTER YESTERDAY'S MARCH WERE SITTING CLEAN AND NEATLY DRESSED AT A ROUND TABLE IN THE PLEASANT QUARTERS ALLOTTED TO THEM PLAYING CHESS
1701-141760-0006 WELL HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT HE RETURNED

1701-141760-0010 HE WANTED TO PINCH HIM PUSH HIM AND DO ANYTHING BUT KISS HIM A THING EVERYBODY DID
1701-141760-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS BOLUS EMBRACED HIM IN A QUIET FRIENDLY WAY AND KISSED HIM THREE TIMES
1701-141760-0012 THEY HAD NOT MET FOR NEARLY HALF A YEAR AND BEING AT THE AGE WHEN YOUNG MEN TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS ON LIFE'S ROAD EACH SAW IMMENSE CHANGES IN THE OTHER QUITE A NEW RELATION OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN THOSE FIRST STEPS

1701-141760-0022 BERG PUT ON THE CLEANEST OF COATS WITHOUT A SPOT OR SPECK OF DUST STOOD BEFORE A LOOKING GLASS AND BRUSHED THE HAIR ON HIS TEMPLES UPWARDS IN THE WAY AFFECTED BY THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF FROM THE WAY ROSTOV LOOKED AT IT THAT HIS COAT HAD BEEN NOTICED LEFT THE ROOM WITH A SPLENDID SMILE
1701-141760-0023 OH DEAR WHAT A BEAST I AM MUTTERED ROSTOV AS HE READ THIS LETTER WHY
1701-141760-0024 WELL HAVE YOU SENT GABRIELLE FOR SOME WINE ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE SOME
1701-141760-0025 IN A LETTER FROM HIS PARENTS WAS ENCLOSED A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION TO BAGRATION WHICH THE OLD COUNTESS AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S ADVICE HAD OBTAINED THROUGH AN ACQUAINTANCE AND SENT TO HER FATHER ASKING HIM TO TAKE IT TO ITS DESTINATION AND MAKE USE OF IT
1701-141760-0026 BUT WHY HAVE YOU THROWN THAT AWAY ASKED BORIS
1701-141760-0027 IT IS SO LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT THE DEVIL DO I WANT IT FOR
1701-141760-0028 HE LOOKED INTENTLY AND INQUIRINGLY INTO HIS FRIEND'S EYES EVIDENTLY TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION
1701-141760-0029 WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT COUNT I WAS NOT AT ALL ALARMED BECAUSE I THINK I WAS RIGHT
1701-141760-0030 I CAME FORWARDS BERG STOOD UP AND SHOWED HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR A FACE TO EXPRESS GREATER RESPECT AND SELF COMPLACENCY THAN HIS DID
1701-141760-0031 WELL HE STORMED AT ME AS THE SAYING IS STORMED AND STORMING AND STORMED
1701-141760-0032 IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF LIFE BUT RATHER OF DEATH AS THE SAME IS
1701-141760-0033 ALBANIANS AND DEVILS AND TO SIBERIA SAID BERGS WITH A SAGACIOUS SMILE
1701-141760-0034 BUT STILL I REMAINED SILENT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK COUNT
1701-141760-0035 THE NEXT YEAR IT WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ORDERS OF THE DAY
1701-141760-0036 THAT'S THE DEE COUNT SAID BERG LIGHTING HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE
1701-141760-0037 YES THAT WAS FINE SAID ROSTOV SMILING AND
1701-141760-0038 ROSTOV WAS A TRUTHFUL YOUNG MAN AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT HAVE TOLD A DOUBLE LIE
1701-141760-0039 HE BEGAN HIS STORY MEANING TO TELL EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAPPENED BUT IMPERCEPTIBLY INVOLUNTARILY AND INEVITABLY HE LAPSED INTO FALSE HOPE
1701-141760-0040 PRINCE ANDREW WHO LIKE TO HELP YOUNG MEN WAS FLATTERED BY BEING ASKED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE AND BEING WELL DISPOSED TOWARD BORIS WHO HAD MANAGED TO PLEASE HIM THE DAY BEFORE HE WISHED TO DO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WANTED
1701-141760-0041 IN SPITE OF PRINCE ANDREW'S DISAGREEABLE IRONICAL TONE IN SPITE OF THE CONTENT WITH WHICH ROSTOV FROM HIS FIGHTING ARMY POINT OF VIEW REGARDED ALL HIS LITTLE ADJUTANTS ON THE STAFF OF WHOM THE NEWCOMER WAS EVIDENTLY ONE ROSTOV FELT CONFUSED BLUSHED AND BECAME SILENT
1701-141760-0042 BORIS INQUIRED WHAT NEWS THERE MIGHT BE ON THE STAFF AND WHAT WITHOUT INDISCRETION ONE MIGHT ASK ABOUT THE PLANS
1701-141760-0043 WE SHALL PROBABLY DANCE REPLIED BOLKOWSKI EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO SAY MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER
1701-141760-0044 BERCK TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WITH GREAT POLITENESS WHETHER AS WAS RUMORED THE ALLOWANCE OF FORAGE MONEY TO CAPTAINS OF COMPANIES WOULD BE DOUBLED
1701-141760-0045 I WAS SO SAID ROSTOV ANGRILY AS IF INTENDING TO INSULT THE AIDE DE CAMP
1701-141760-0046 WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HE SAID YES THERE ARE MANY STORIES NOW TOLD ABOUT THAT PAIR
1701-141760-0047 BUT OUR STORIES ARE THE STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER THE ENEMY'S FIRE
1701-141760-0048 OUR STORIES HAVE SOME WEIGHT NOT LIKE THE STORIES OF THOSE FELLOWS ON THIS STAFF WHO GET REWARDS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
1701-141760-0049 HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME BUT I DON'T FORGET THAT I DO NOT REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED AND AS A MAN OLDER THAN YOU MY ADVICE IS TO LET THE MATTER DROP
1701-141760-0050 EXCLAIMED JOHN ANDREW AND WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH HE WENT OUT
1701-141760-0051 THAT HE WAS STILL MORE ANGRY AT HAVING OMITTED TO SEE IT
1701-141760-0052 HE ORDERED HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND COLDLY TAKING LEAVE OF BOLUS RODE HOME
1701-141760-0053 SHOULD HE GO TO HEADQUARTERS NEXT DAY AND CHALLENGE THAT AFFECTED ADJUTANT OR REALLY LET THE MATTER DROP IS THE QUESTION THAT WORRIED HIM ALL THE WAY

2506-169427-0003 EUGENIUS WOULD NEVER ADMIT THIS AND COULD OFTEN TELL HIM THAT ONE DAY OR OTHER HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE RECKONED WITH AND HE WOULD OFTEN ADD IN AN ACCENT OF SORROWFUL APPREHENSION TO THE UTTERMOST MIGHT

3660-172182-0020 AND BEING YOUNG HE CHANGED HIMSELF AND GREW TO HATE THE SIN THAT SEEMED SO LIKE HIS OWN OF MODRED OTHA'S NEPHEW AND FELL AT LAST IN THE GREAT BATTLE FIGHTING FOR THE KING
3660-172182-0021 AND WHEN DURRANT CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE GUENEVER WAS HE SALUTED HIM
3660-172182-0022 THEN THEY WENT IN AND DISMOUNTTED
3660-172182-0023 HEAVEN PROTECTED THEE SAID ARTHUR AND THE WELCOME OF HEAVEN BE UNTO THEE
3660-172182-0024 AND INASMUCH AS THOU HAST VANQUISHED EDDIR AND THE SON OF NUD THOU HAST HAD A PROSPEROUS CAREER
3660-172182-0025 AND FROM THAT TIME SHE BECAME YOUR WIFE
3660-172182-0026 AND A MAIDEN TOOK UP HER ABODE IN THE PALACE AND SHE HAD MANY COMPANIONS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND THERE WAS NO MAIDEN MORE ESTEEMED THAN SHE IN THE ISLAND OF BRITAIN
3660-172182-0027 THEN A YEAR AND A SECOND AND A THIRD HE PROCEEDED THUS UNTIL HIS FAME HAD FLOWN OVER THE FACE OF THE KINGDOM
3660-172182-0028 AND HE GREETS THEE WELL AS AN UNCLE SHOULD GREET HIS NEPHEW AND AS A VASSAL TO GREET HIS LORD
3660-172182-0029 AND THE NEIGHBOURING CHIEFS KNOWING THIS GROW INSOLENT TOWARD HIM AND COVERT HIS LAND AND POSITIONS
3660-172182-0030 AND ARTHUR TOLD DURRANT THE CAUSE OF THE MISSION AND OF THE COMING OF THE AMBASSADORS TO HIM OUT OF CORNWALL TRULY SAID DURAINT BE IT TO MY ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE LORD I WILL DO ACCORDING TO THY WILL CONCERNING THIS EMBASSY

3660-172182-0034 AS HE SAID TO DURRANT I AM A FEEBLE AND AN AGED MAN AND WHILST I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE DOMINIONS FOR THEE AND FOR MYSELF I DID SO
3660-172182-0035 AND EVERY BODY ASKED THAT WHICH HE DESIRED
3660-172182-0036 AND THEY WERE NOT LONG IN BECOMING SO EAGER WAS EVERY ONE TO BESTOW GIFTS AND OF THOSE WHO CAME TO ASK GIFTS NONE DEPARTED UNSATISFIED
3660-172182-0037 THEN JARAINE SENT EMBASSES TO THE MEN OF CORNWALL TO ASK THEM MISS
3660-172182-0038 AND THEY ALL SAID IT WOULD BE THE FULNESS OF JOY AND HONOUR TO THEM FOR DURINT TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR HOMAGE
3660-172182-0039 SO HE RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF SUCH AS WERE THEREIN
3660-172182-0040 AND THE DAY AFTER THE FOLLOWERS OF ARTHUR HAD INTENDED TO GO AWAY
3660-172183-0000 DURAGINT AS HE HAD BEEN USED TO DO WHEN HE WAS AT ARTHUR'S COURT FREQUENTED TOURNAMENTS
3660-172183-0001 BEFORE ZRAINT THE SCOURGE OF THE ENEMY I SAW STEEDS WHITE WITH FOAM AND AFTER THE SHOUT OF BATTLE A FEARFUL TORRENT

3660-172183-0004 AND THE TEARES SHE SAID AND THE WORDS SHE HAD SPOKEN AWOKE HIM
3660-172183-0005 AN EVIL BETIDE ME SAID HE IF THOU RETURNEST HERE UNTIL THOU KNOWEST WHETHER I HAVE LOST MY STRENGTH SO GREATLY AS THOU DIDST SAY
3660-172183-0006 THEN GERRAINT WENT TO SEE URBAN

3660-172183-0010 AND HE DESIRED ENID TO MOUNT HIS HORSE AND TO RIDE FORWARD AND TO KEEP A LONG WAY BEFORE HIM
3660-172183-0011 AND UNLESS I SPEAK UNTO THEE SAY NOT I ONE WORD EITHER
3660-172183-0012 AND THOUGH THOU SHOULDST DESIRE TO SEE MY RETREAT AND MY DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THOSE MEN YET DO I FEEL NO DREAD

3660-172183-0019 AND THEY LEFT THE WOODS AND THEY CAME TO AN OPEN COUNTRY WITH MEADOWS ON ONE HAND AND MOWS MOWING THE MEADOWS
3660-172183-0020 AND MY LORD HE ADDED WILL IT BE DISPLEASING TO THEE IF I ASK WHENCE THOU COMEST ALSO
3660-172183-0021 WILT THOU FOUL MY PEACE SAID THE YOUTH AND TAKE THY MEAL FROM ME
3660-172183-0022 WHAT SORT OF MEAL THEY INQUIRED
3660-172183-0023 THEN THEY WASHED AND TOOK TO THEIR REPAST
3660-172183-0024 AND GO NOW LORD SAID HE TO MEET THE KNIGHT AND TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS LODGING
3660-172183-0025 THAT WILL DO LORD SAID SHE AS THOU SAYEST
3660-172183-0026 AND AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRANK JERRAY WENT TO SLEEP AND SO DID ENID ALSO
3660-6517-0000 THE DEBTS SEEM UNIMPORTANT BUT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE SHIP HAVE BEEN UNREMITTINGLY BUSY
3660-6517-0001 BOWERS ATTACKED THE SHIP'S STORES SURVEYED RELISTED AND RESTOWED THEM SAVING AS MUCH SPACE BY UNSTOWING NUMEROUS CASES AND STOWING THE CONTENTS IN THE LAZARETTE
3660-6517-0002 WITHOUT STEAM THE LEAKS CAN NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH THE HAND PUMP BY TWO DAILY EFFORTS OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES
3660-6517-0003 AS THAT SHIP WAS AND IN HER PRESENT HEAVILY LADEN CONDITION IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE OR FOUR HOURS EACH DAY
3660-6517-0004 THE LARGE GREEN TENT WAS PUT UP AND PROPER REPORTS MADE FOR IT
3660-6517-0005 THE ENGINEROOMS STAFF ANDERSEN'S PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOWING THEIR LABORATORIES THE COOK REFITTING HIS GALLEY AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD ITS BAND OF WORKERS
3660-6517-0006 THE MAID'S SPACE SUCH AS IT IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FORE HATCH TO THE STEM ON THE MAIN DECK
3660-6517-0007 UNDER THE FORECASTLE ARE STALLS OF FIFTEEN PONIES THE MAXIMUM THE SPACE WOULD HOLD THAT NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT IS PACKED TIGHT WITH FODDER
3660-6517-0008 IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FORECASTLE BULKWOOD IS A SMALL BOOBY HATCH THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE MEN'S MESS DECK IN BAD WEATHER
3660-6517-0009 ABAFT THE FORE HATCH IS THE ICE HOUSE AND
3660-6517-0010 WE MANAGED TO GET THREE TONS OF ICE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO CACASES OF MUTTON AND THREE CAUCASSES OF BEEF BESIDES SOME BOXES OF SWEETBREADS AND KIDNEYS INTO THIS SPACE
3660-6517-0011 THE SACKS CONTAINING THIS LAST ADDED TO THE GOODS ALREADY MENTIONED MAKE A REALLY HEAVY DECK CARGO AND ONE IS NATURALLY ANXIOUS CONCERNING IT BUT ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY LASHING AND SECURING HAS BEEN DONE
3660-6517-0012 FORAGE I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIRTY TONS OF COMPRESSED OAT AND BAY FROM MELBOURNE
3660-6517-0013 THE SCENE IS REALLY ENCHANTING AND SUCH A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER IN A GARDEN WHICH BLAZES WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION WITH ALL THINGS
3660-6517-0014 A GREAT MASS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED TO
3660-6517-0015 KAY AND I LUNCH WITH A PARTY IN THE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY'S SHIP RUPAHOOS
3660-6517-0016 TELEGRAM TO SAY TERENNOVA HAD ARRIVED SUNDAY NIGHT
3660-6517-0017 A THIRD SLEDGE STANDS ACROSS THE BREAK OF THE POOP IN THE SPACES HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY THE AFTER WINCH
3660-6517-0018 THE QUANTITY IS TWO AND A HALF TONS AND THE SPACE OCCUPIED THROUGH
3660-6517-0019 THE SHIP WAS ONLY TWO FEET BY THE STERN BUT THIS WILL SOON BE REMEDIED
3660-6517-0020 THEY MUST PERFORCE BE CHAINED UP AND THEY HAVE GIVEN WHAT SHELTER IS AFFORDED ON DECK BUT THEIR POSITION IS NOT ENVIABLE
3660-6517-0021 IT IS A PATHETIC ATTITUDE DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY OCCASIONALLY SOME POOR BEAST IS EMITS A LONG PATHETIC WHINE
3660-6517-0022 THERE ARE GENERALLY ONE OR TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASES MATTERS BUT IT IS A SQUAR
3660-6517-0023 LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND HAS VEERED TO THE WESTWARD HEADING UP SLIGHTLY
3660-6517-0024 OATES AND ATKINSON WITH INTERMITTENT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHERS WERE BUSY MAKING THE PONIES ON THEIR LEGS
3660-6517-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EVIL AND NEARLY ALL HANDS WERE LABORING FOR HOURS ON THE WAISTS OF THE SHIP HEAVING COAL SACKS OVERBOARD AND RELASHING THE PETROL CASES ET CETERA IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
3660-6517-0026 NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED THAN SOME EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY WAVE WOULD TEAR AWAY THE LASHING AND THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE AGAIN
3660-6517-0027 FROM THIS MOMENT ABOUT FOUR A M THE EVENING ROOM BECAME THE CENTRE OF INTEREST
3660-6517-0028 ALL THE WATER GAINED IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT
3660-6517-0029 AND THE OUTLOOK APPEARED GRIM
3660-6517-0030 THE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH WAS BEING MADE WITH THE SHIPS SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS MOST UNFORTUNATE
3660-6517-0031 WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW OUR FIRES WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
3660-6517-0032 A BILAGE PUMP IS DEPENDENT ON THE MAIN ENGINE
3660-6517-0033 ON ONE OCCASION I WAS WAIST DEEP WHEN STANDING ON THE RAIL OF POOP
3660-6517-0034 THE AFTERGUARDS WERE ORGANIZED IN TWO PARTIES BY EVANS TO WORK BUCKETS THE MEN WERE KEPT STEADILY GOING ON THE CHOKED HAND PUMPS THIS SEEMED ALL THAT COULD BE DONE FOR THE MOMENT AND WAS A MEASURE TO COUNT AS THE SOLE SAFEGUARD OF THE SHIP FROM SINKING PRACTICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BAIL HER OUT
3660-6517-0035 OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD BEAR ONE OF THEM AWAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED BY HIS CHEER
3663-172005-0000 THE FAWN HAS TAKEN THIS MORNING MEAL AND NOW LAY CURLED UP ON A BED OF MOSS
3663-172005-0001 AND WHENEVER THE FAWN CAUGHT UP HE WAS QUITE CONTENT TO FRISK ABOUT
3663-172005-0002 THE DANGER WAS CERTAIN NOW AND WAS NEAR
3663-172005-0003 THE HOUNDS HAD STRUCK A TRAIL WHERE SHE TURNED BUT THE FAWN WAS SAFE
3663-172005-0004 THE ONE WAS ROWING THE OTHER HAD A GUN IN HIS HAND WHAT SHOULD SHE DO
3663-172005-0005 BUT HER TIRED LEGS COULD NOT PROPEL THE TIRED BODY RAPIDLY
3663-172005-0006 THE DOE SAW THE BOAT NEARING HERS
3663-172005-0007 IN A MOMENT MORE THE BOAT WAS ON THEM AND THE MEN AT THE OARS HAD LEANED OVER AND CAUGHT HER
3663-172528-0000 I WAS TORMENTED BY THIRST BUT HAD ABSTAINED FROM DRINKING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO HIS DOCTOR'S ORDERS
3663-172528-0001 THAT OLD MAN LIKED TO GIVE SO MUCH ANNOYANCE YET SOMETIMES HE APPEARED TO ME IN DREAMS
3663-172528-0002 FELICIA GIVEN THEM ORDERS NOT TO SPEAK TO ME OF THEM
3663-172528-0003 THIS MAID HAD STOLEN FROM ME A CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND IN HER FEAR OF BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD DIED
3663-172528-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE ALLOWED ME TWICE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN A GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FULL I THEN COVERED MYSELF AND BEGAN TO SWEAT AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
3663-172528-0005 THEY SAY THAT MY POOR FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO GRIEVED WAS HE TO PERCEIVE THIS
3663-172528-0006 AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY STATE AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE SERVING GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT SHOUTING OUT AH TRAITRESS YOU HAVE KILLED ME FOR ME THEN
3663-172528-0007 SHE MAY INDEED HAVE SAVED MY LIFE SO LEND ME A HELPING HAND FOR I HAVE SWEATED AND BE QUICK ABOVE IT
3663-172528-0008 FELICIA RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS DRIED AND MADE ME COMFORTABLE AND I BEING CONSCIOUS OF A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN MY STATE BEGIN TO RECKON ON RECOVERY
3663-172528-0009 JUST THEN THE OTHER DOCTOR OF BERNARDINO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAD REFUSED TO BLEED ME
3663-172528-0010 MAESTRO FRANCESCO THAT MOST ABLE MAN EXCLAIMED OH POWER IN NATURE
3663-172528-0011 SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE PHYSICIANS KNOW NOTHINGS
3663-172528-0012 THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE AN ANSWER SAYING IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED UPON THE SPOT
3663-172528-0013 AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK NO WATER
3663-172528-0014 I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED MINE THIRST
3663-172528-0015 IN A LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED IT TO BLEED HIM
3663-172528-0016 IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YE NOT SAY SO BEFORE
3663-172528-0017 YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF MY CURE
3663-172528-0018 AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER FOUND HIS FACE AGAIN
3663-172528-0019 THAT VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTING FROM THE COLD
3663-172528-0020 DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THO HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME IN ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM
3663-172528-0021 THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO GET ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE
3663-172528-0022 SO I MADE MY MIND UP AND BEGAN TO TRAVEL
3663-172528-0023 THAT NIGHT MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIERRE LANDY WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
3663-172528-0024 NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUTTO WHO IS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
3663-172528-0025 I HAD HARBOURED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCABS WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS
3663-172528-0026 MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DA MONTEVERCCHI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL
3663-172528-0027 THERE THEY FOUND ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY
3663-172528-0028 MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKES
3663-172528-0029 AT THESE WORDS MAESTRA AGOSTINO THE DUKE'S TAILOR MADE HIS WAY TO ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT
3663-172528-0030 GEORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MYASTHRO AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED THERE IS THE MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NO
3663-172528-0031 AS FIERCELY AS I COULD NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED GIORGIAN IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0032 HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO OR THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THE SWORD
3663-172528-0033 MAESTRO AUGUSTINO RETORTED YOU GALLOWS BIRD AND
3663-172528-0034 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT FOR A MOST CERTAIN
3663-172528-0035 GEORGUL MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0036 THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF LAID UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND HE HALTED
3663-172528-0037 THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MARVELLED I WAS STILL ALIVE AFTERWARDS HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY FAITH
3663-172528-0038 WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTE E GUTTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME
3663-172528-0039 I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND TOLD HIM ALL THE AFFAIR WITH THE MINT
3663-172528-0040 HE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR I WILL SEE YOUR VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT
3663-172528-0041 I THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIETRO PAGOLO ADVICE ABOUT STAMPING THE COINS AND THEN WENT OUT UPON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE DUKE OR ANYBODY ELSE
3663-172528-0042 YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALISE THAT FEROCIOUS PIRATE
3663-172528-0043 YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THAT POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS
3663-172528-0044 IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO IS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENT
3663-172528-0045 MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DYES THAT MEDAL
3663-172528-0046 I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF IT THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE
3663-172528-0047 I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENZCINO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL
3663-172528-0048 NICCOLO DA MONTERE GUTTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENZCINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
3663-172528-0049 NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED THAT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
3663-172528-0050 I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORKS FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY
3663-172528-0051 THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT COURAGE HE HAD GAINED
3663-172528-0052 I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND TO A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL
3663-172528-0053 I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY ANOTHER WAYS OF LOADING
3663-172528-0054 I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR RAM
3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER AND ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE
3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YES IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE
3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADES THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF CAWANNA
3915-57461-0003 HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED WITH FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELERS EMBARKED
3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS THOUGH THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM
3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RONON FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
3915-57461-0006 NOW LAST BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE
3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS REMEMBERED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM
3915-57461-0008 THEN THE ROANON SAID TO A BOATMAN
3915-57461-0009 WHAT THINK OF YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS
3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONIAN HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONION OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO
3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILDREN
3915-57461-0013 SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THE THIEF
3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND TOUCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR
3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATIONS TO KOBAY FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERY MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME
3915-57461-0016 NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT ROOM
3915-57461-0017 AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY WHISPERING ALL OVER
3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO AT THE CUANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER THAT
3915-57461-0019 HAPLY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THAT WISH OF MY HEART
3915-57461-0020 ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING AT THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MARVELLOUS AILMENT
3915-57461-0021 THINKING I COULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU I AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
3915-57461-0022 AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO HEAR MALICE
3915-57461-0023 REPENT THEREFORE AN ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAYS
3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM HER HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS
3915-57461-0025 BE OF A GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TORMENT YOU
3915-57461-0026 IN A FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO STEAL AND ROB YOU
3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WEAK I HAD BEEN AND THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOME DAY OVERTAKE ME
3915-57461-0028 HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL EVIL
3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW YOU MANAGE TO ESCAPE AND HAVE STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
3915-57461-0030 A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOW
3915-98647-0000 EVERY WELL USED JAPANESE HOME OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTRE OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOUSE
3915-98647-0001 SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY IN ANNIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS
3915-98647-0002 THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHER AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESETS CHILD LIFE
3915-98647-0003 VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES TO RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION
3915-98647-0004 ALL THESE WERE PUT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT THE CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF THE SON
3915-98647-0005 AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWERS OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE
3915-98647-0006 EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY THE SKILLFUL BALANCER OF PROSE AND KHANS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE
3915-98647-0007 FOR THE GREATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE THE HOME PROPHECIES ARE FELT TO BE TOO CERTAIN AND THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED IN
3915-98647-0008 NO WELL MANAGED PARTY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR
3915-98647-0009 AFTER THIS MANNER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE IS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION ABOUT WHICH MUCH DEPENDS
3915-98647-0010 OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THIS DAY WHEN THE ROOF IS RAISED
3915-98647-0011 THE HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THIS DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
3915-98647-0012 A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABORERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE RIDGE POLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SCRAMBLED JOYFULLY
3915-98647-0013 ALL COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CANNOT COME SEND SERVANTS OR PROFESSIONS
3915-98647-0014 ON THE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN A CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT TILL RECENTLY WAS THE STYLE COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN
3915-98647-0015 NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES A SURVIVAL OF ITS OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE
3915-98647-0016 AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF HER CORPSE
3915-98647-0017 THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF THE PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL
3915-98647-0018 UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL TO THE LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS
3915-98647-0019 WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IT IS DRESSED IN WHITE AND SILK HABOTICE WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT
3915-98647-0020 THE BODY TO BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN MAY BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS
3915-98647-0021 THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THE COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THAT THE DEAD TAKES WITH IT TO THE NEXT WORLD
3915-98647-0022 THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEED THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS A BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH
3915-98647-0023 LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES ON THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF TEA
3915-98647-0024 SO LONG AS THE COFFIN IS IN THE HOUSE IT MAY BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY
3915-98647-0025 IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED IN REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES
3915-98647-0026 THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING IN THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY
3915-98647-0027 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF ALL THESE CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED
3915-98647-0028 A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUCUSSAWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING
3915-98647-0029 IN HIS WILL HE REGARDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING IN THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED
3915-98647-0030 THROUGH THIS GROWING FEELING AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION THEY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES
3915-98647-0031 JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE PALACE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY
3915-98647-0032 ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF THE NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT
3915-98647-0033 SOMETIMES WITH THE GIFT THE MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN
3915-98647-0034 ANOTHER FAVORED PRESENT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON
3915-98647-0035 IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURIAL AND
3915-98647-0036 DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING A HOUSE AND A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET UP IN THE DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY
4153-185072-0000 HE TARRIED AT GENESHAW A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP TO GAUDOS WHERE I THEN RESIDED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE WINTER CAME ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS STAY
4153-185072-0001 THE ENRAGED HUSBAND WELL KNOWING THAT HE SHOULD FEEL A BLOW IF HE WAITED TO HEAR THIS ORDER REPEATED INSTANTLY RETREATED AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS CATTLE
4153-185072-0002 WE PROTECTED THE POOR NATICOKE WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUALS AND ALLAN SYMPATHIZED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES TILL SPRING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE PROMISED A REFORMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OF RENEWAL OF HIS AFFECTION
4153-185072-0003 THE INDIANS WERE SOON ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN OFFICER THAT THE WAMPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS ARDENTLY SOUGHT FOR
4153-185072-0004 MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ALANE'S HORSE AND CARRIED THE GOODS
4153-185072-0005 ALLEYNE ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT ON HIS RETURN THEY WERE SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTLE'S WHO MARRIED PRISCILLA RAMSAY WITH A SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM
4153-185072-0006 NETTLES AT LENGTH ABANDONED THE CHASE WENT HOME AND AAREN ALL IN TATTERS CAME IN
4153-185072-0007 BY DRAWING IN THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO RAGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SUFFERING CONDITION ALMOST NAKED
4153-185072-0008 ALLEYNE MADE HIS INQUIRIES HIMSELF AND THEN BUILT A RAFT ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MONT MORRIS
4153-185072-0009 THERE AN INDIAN GAVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A GOOD GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE PETERSTOWN WHERE HE FOUND HIS SQUAW
4153-185072-0010 NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THAT PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO HERDO
4153-185072-0011 THE LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SWIFTNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE TO HIS FORMER COAST OF SAFETY
4153-185072-0012 HIS PURSUERS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO OUR HOUSE WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETED AND UNDER MY PROTECTION
4153-185072-0013 STILL UNSATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THEY ADVISED MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME THIS SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDERED OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT TO MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF HIS SITUATION AND FINALLY THEY LEFT ME
4153-185072-0014 HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOKE ME WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION FEARING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN AS IN A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
4153-185072-0015 AT THAT TIME ALLAN LAID IN A SECRET PLACE IN THE GULF A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FLATS IN A HOLE THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER
4153-186222-0000 THERE'S LITTLE DANGER IN THIS QUARTER I'M SURE SO I MAY AS WELL BE FRIENDS WITH MY POOR CHILD
4153-186222-0001 AH MY NOT
4153-186222-0002 BETH HESITATED TO
4153-186222-0003 THE LETTER ASKING ME TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAD RECEIVED FROM HER
4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE SHE ASKED US TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FRIENDLY AND SO I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
4153-186222-0005 SURELY TWO GIRLS COULD HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS LONELY OLD PLACE THAN ONE COULD HAVE ALONE
4153-186222-0006 OH YES SHE'S CORRECTED LOUISE
4153-186222-0007 YOU MEAN PATRICIA DOYLE MISS
4153-186222-0008 BUT WE MAY CONCLUDE SHE'S LEFT OUT OF THE ARRANGEMENT SAID BETH CALMLY
4153-186222-0009 YOU'LL FIGHT FOR YOUR OWN CHANCE AND FIGHT MIGHTY BAD
4153-186222-0010 WHY MY DEAR COUSIN I DON'T WANT AUNTIE'S MONEY
4153-186222-0011 MY BROTHER AND I ARE AMPLY PROVIDED FOR AND I AM ONLY HERE TO FIND REST FROM MY SOCIAL DUTIES AND TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH MY DEAD FATHER'S SISTER THAT IS ALL
4153-186222-0012 MY FATHER TEACHES MUSICS AND MOTHER SCOLDS HIM CONTINUALLY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT
4153-186222-0013 WE'VE NEVER SEEN A CENT OF HER MONEY ALTHOUGH FATHER HAS TRIED AT ONCE TO BORROW ENOUGH TO HELP HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
4153-186222-0014 I EVEN KISSED HER WHEN SHE ASKED ME TO AND IT HAS SENT A SHIVER ALL DOWN MY BACK
4153-186222-0015 FOR MY PART I AM FOND OF EVERY ONE AND IT DELIGHTS ME TO FUSS AROUND INVALIDS AND ASSIST HIM
4153-186222-0016 YOU SAY YOU'D LIKE TO CARE FOR IN WILLARDS AND I DON'T
4153-186222-0017 YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME THINK YOU DON'T WANT ELMHURST OR YOU'RE AS ANXIOUS TO GET IT AS I AM
4153-186222-0018 THEY CALL ME BETH SUSANLY
4153-186222-0019 I COULDN'T LIVE IN THIS OUT O THE WAY CORNER OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW
4153-186222-0020 BUT SUPPOSE SHE LEAVES IT TO YOU PERSISTED BES
4153-186222-0021 LOUISE SEEMED TO MEDITATE TOO
4153-186222-0022 OH IT'S A MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID BETH LOOKING AT HER COUSIN DOUBTFULLY
4153-186222-0023 NOW SHALL WE BE GOOD FRIENDS SHE ASKED LIGHTLY
4153-186222-0024 TO BE SURE I SHOULD WANT YOU TO MY FATHER
4153-186222-0025 SUCH A GIRL FRIEND IT HAD NEVER BEEN HER PRIVILEGE TO HAVE BEFORE AND WHEN HER SUSPICIONS WERE FORGOTTEN SHE BECAME FAIRLY RESPONSIVE AND BRIGHTENED WONDERFUL
4153-186222-0026 SILAS SHE ASKED WHEN HE ENTERED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY NIECES
4153-186222-0027 THEY ARE VERY CHARMING GIRLS HE ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THEY ARE AT AN AGE WHEN FEW GIRLS SHOW TO THAT ADVANTAGE
4153-186222-0028 WHY DID YOU NOT INVITE KENNESH TO DINNER JANE THE BOY
4153-186222-0029 NOW HE IS CONSTANTLY SAYING DISAGREEABLE THINGS
4153-186222-0030 VERY WELL SAID THE LATTER QUIETLY WHICH OF MY NIECES DO YOU PREFER
4153-186222-0031 ASKED THE OLD LADY AFTER A PAUSE I CAN'T SAY ON SO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE HE ANSWERED WITH GRAVITY WHICH DO YOU PREFER JANE
4153-186222-0032 BUT THEY ARE EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY SHE ANSWERED
4153-186222-0033 I DID NOT IMAGINE ELMHURST BELONGING TO EITHER SILAS
4153-186222-0034 I MUST SEE THAT OTHER NIECE THE ONE WHO DEFIES ME AND REFUSES TO ANSWER MY SECRET LETTER
4153-186222-0035 THERE WOULD BE A DOZEN HEIRS TO FIGHT FOR MY MONEY AND DEAR OLD ELMHURST WOULD BE SOLD TO STRANGERS SHE RESOLVED WITH BITTERNESS
4153-186223-0000 IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE ROOM KENNETH FORBES SQUATTED UPON A BENCH WITH AN EMPTY PAN BOX HELD CARELESSLY IN HIS LAP
4153-186223-0001 WHILE DUNCAN WORKED THE BOY WAS BUSY WITH HIS PENCILS BUT NEITHER HAD SPOKEN FOR AT LEAST HALF HOUR
4153-186223-0002 THEN RIDING SLOWLY TO THE HEDGE BORDERED ROAD HIS TROUBLES ONCE MORE ASSAILED HIM AND HE WONDERED IF THERE WAS NOT SOME SPOT UPON THE BROAD EARTH TO WHICH HE COULD FLY FOR RETIREMENT UNTIL THE GIRLS HAD LEFT ELMHURST FOR GOOD
4153-186223-0003 NORAH SHIED AND HE LOOKED UP TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAD MERELY RUN DOWN A PEDESTRIAN A STOUT LITTLE MAN WITH A BUNDLE UNDER HIS ARM WHO HELD UP ONE HAND AS IF TO ARREST HIM
4153-186223-0004 WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO ASKED THAT BOY
4153-186223-0005 THERE IT'S THE SAME JANE AS EVER HE RESPONDED WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
4153-186223-0006 DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT O HOPED SHE'D REFORMED AND I'LL BE GLAD TO SEE HER AGAIN THEY TELL ME SHE'S GOT MONEY
4153-186223-0007 AUNT JANE'S RICH AUNT JANE OH
4153-186223-0008 ECHOED THE MAN QUICKLY WHAT CAN YOU NAME LAD
4153-186223-0009 DON'T LIKE GIRLS I THINK AND
4153-186223-0010 ANOTHER LONG PAUSE THEN THE BOY SUDDENLY RETURNED QUESTIONING
4153-186223-0011 YOU KNOW MY AUNT MISS MERRICK SIR
4153-186223-0012 I USED TO WHEN WE WERE ALL YOUNGER
4153-186223-0013 KENNETH STOPPED SHORT AND THE MAYOR STOPPED AND THAT LITTLE MAN WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT ALSO STOPPED
4153-186223-0014 JOHN MERRICK THAT'S RIGHT
4153-186223-0015 YOU ARE WITH THE TINSMITH
4153-186223-0016 THEY KEPT TRACK OF HER BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY BECAME RICH AND A GREAT LADY AND THAT WAS A SURPRISING THING TO HAPPEN TO AHMERRICK
4153-186223-0017 THANK YOU LAD RETURNED THE MAN GRATEFULLY I THOUGHT A LITTLE EXERCISE WOULD DO ME GOOD BUT THIS THREE MILES HAS SEEMED LIKE FIFTY TO ME
4153-186223-0018 HE WILL SAID THE MAN
4153-186223-0019 THE POOR BOY TURNED AWAY BUT IN A MOMENT HALTED AGAIN
4153-186223-0020 HIS INTEREST IN MISS JANE'S BROTHERS JOHN WAS EXTRAORDINARY
4153-61735-0000 THEY ARE BUT LUKEWARM LOVERS WHO CAN CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH A DIALOGUE CARRIED ON AT BEAUSHOT DISTANCES
4153-61735-0001 IF THERE BE AN ELYSIUM ON EARTH IT IS THEN
4153-61735-0002 HIS OWN DAUGHTER HIS ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE BEST BLOOD OF SOUTHERN ARISTOCRACY BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING TO SECURE HIM A SPLENDID ALLIANCE HOLDING THE KNIGHTLY ASSIGNATION WITH THE HORSE HUNTER
4153-61735-0003 HE COULD WELL CONCEDE SO MUCH TO HER CAPRICE SINCE HER STAYING AT HOME COULD BE NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE CAUSE THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO THE STERNER COUNCIL
4153-61735-0004 IT IS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THIS ROAD PASSED THE HACIENDA OF CASA DEL CARVO AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER
4153-61735-0005 ON REACHING THE COPSE HE DISMOUNTED LED HIS HORSE IN AMONG THE UNDERWOOD HITCHED HIM BY LOOPING HIS BRIDLE REIN AROUND THE TOPMOST TWIGS OF AN ELASTIC BOW THEN DETACHING A LONG ROPE OF TWISTED HORSEHAIR FROM THE HORN OF HIS SADDLE AND INSERTING HIS ARM INTO ITS COILS HE GLIDED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND ON THAT SIDE THAT LAY TOWARDS THE HACIENDA
4153-61735-0006 BEFORE FORSAKING THE SHADOW OF THE PORCH HE CAST A GLANCE TOWARD THE SKY AND AT THE MOON SAILING SUPREMELY OVER IT
4153-61735-0007 THE DROLL CONCEIT WHICH HAS SO OFT AMUSED THE NOCTURNAL INEBRIATE OF GREAT CITIES APPEARED TO PRODUCE A LIKE EFFECT UPON THE NIGHT PATROLER OF THE PRAIRIE AND FOR A MOMENT THE SHADOW LATE DARKENING HIS BROW DISAPPEARED
4153-61735-0008 IT'S NOT LIKELY IF I ARE UNLESS IT BE THE OWNER OF A BAD CONSCIENCE WHO CAN'T SLEEP
4153-61735-0009 TROTH THERE'S ONE SUCH WITHIN THOSE ARMS
4153-61735-0010 IF HE BE ABROAD THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF HIS SEEING ME ON THE OPEN GROUND NOT THAT I SHOULD CARE A STRAW IF IT WERE ONLY MYSELF TO BE COMPRAMISED
4153-61735-0011 IT'S NO USE WAITING UPON THE MOON DEUCE DORE
4153-61735-0012 IT IS TRUE HE HAD DESIGNS UPON THE HACIENDA BUT THESE DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EITHER ITS CASH PLATE OR JEWELRY IF WE EXCEPT THE MOST PRECIOUS JEWEL IT CONTAINED THE MISTRESS OF A MANSION HERSELF
4323-13259-0000 THE CHURCH BELLS WERE RINGING AND PEOPLE ON THE AVENUE GOING BY A SERVICE TURNED CURIOUS INQUIRING LOOKS UP AT THE GREAT HOUSE AND THEN WENT ON TALKING OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD SO STRANGELY ENTERED INTO AND MADE HISTORY IN THE CITY
4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSIONING APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMOND HE VOTED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SALOON
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAYMOND STOOD CONDEMNED BY THE RULE
4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT IN RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOONS RULED
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM BROWN SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 BUT IF HE HAD BEGUN TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 WE HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS
4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDISTURBED BY ANY REGULAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAD ALWAYS FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WELLS OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKY POWER AND RAIMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOREVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEETINGS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERISED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE ETERNAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON AND ITS AWFUL CURSE
4323-13259-0013 GREY AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRERS WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LORENE'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO IN PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 GRAY HAD GONE UP TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER AND MAXWELL THE ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERALS SAID GREY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURE WHO KNEW LOREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOUR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR WISHES IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT HOWEVER YOU AND MISS PAGE THINK BEST WILL BE RIGHT
4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DISPLAYED AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND IN HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN A NEIGHBORING CITY
4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES OF THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THIS MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THAT
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE GOOD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 HAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALOONS
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUEER PART OF THIS STRANGE MARRIAGE
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SMALLST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED
4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS SO RECENTLY
4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS PHRONSIE TURNED FEARFULLY BACK
4323-18416-0001 I'LL TRY AND SHE LAID A QUICK HAND ON THE KNOBS
4323-18416-0002 TWO RED SPOTS BURNED ON HER CHEEKS AND HER HEAVY BLUE EYES SNAPPED
4323-18416-0003 YES I'M SURE I HEARD IT RAGING UP AND DOWN
4323-18416-0004 I DON'T WANT ANY DINNER SAID CHARLOTTE GOING BACK
4323-18416-0005 YES INDEED SAID POLLY CHEERILY JUST AS BIG AS CAN BE
4323-18416-0006 ASSUREDLY SAID OLD MISTER KING WITH GREAT SATISFACTION IN POLLY'S PLEASURE AND AT HER SUCCESS IN DRAWING CHARLOTTE OFF
4323-18416-0007 AND AFTER THIS THIS THERE WERE NO MORE QUIET DAYS FOR CHARLOTTE CHATTERTON
4323-18416-0008 OH BLESS ME IT'S YOU PHRONSIE IN PLEASED SURPRISE OH
4323-18416-0009 YES GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE COMING IN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR CAREFULLY I CAME ON PURPOSE TO SEE YOU SO ALONE
4323-18416-0010 SO YOU DID DEAR SAID MISTER KING HIGHLY GRATIFIED AND PUSHING AWAY HIS WRITING TABLE HE HELD OFF HIS HAND
4323-18416-0011 OH NO GRANDPAPA CRIED PHRONSIE IN A RAPTURE I COULD NEVER BE TOO BIG FOR IT SO SHE PERCHED UP AS OF OLD ON HIS KNEE THEN SHE FOLDED HER HANDS AND LOOKED GRAVELY IN HIS FACE
4323-18416-0012 WELL MY DARLING WHAT IS IT
4323-18416-0013 ASKED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PRESENTLY YOU'VE COME TO TELL ME SOMETHING I THINK
4323-18416-0014 YES GRANDPAPA I HAVE SAID PHRONSIE DECIDEDLY AND IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TOO GRANDPAPA AND OH I DO WISH IT SO MUCH AND THEN SHE CLASPED HER HANDS TIGHTER AND SIGHED
4323-18416-0015 WELL THEN PHRONSIE IF YOU NEED IT I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE SAID MISTER KING QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE

4323-18416-0019 GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE WASN'T MISSUS CHATTERTON AUNT TO CHARLOTTES
4323-18416-0020 IF MISSUS CHATTERTON WAS AUNT TO CHARLOTTE PERSISTED PHRONSIE SLOWLY IT SEEMS AS IF CHARLOTTE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF THE MONEY THAT REALLY DOES GRANDPAPA
4323-18416-0021 MAYBE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A SHORT LAUGH AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF COUSIN EUNICE WAS SO SORRY OVER A FEW OTHER THINGS TOO PHRONSIE
4323-18416-0022 WOULDN'T IT MAKE HER VERY GLAD IF THEY GAVE CHARLOTTE SOME OF THE MONEY
4323-18416-0023 FOR ANSWER MISTER KING SET HER DOWN GENTLY ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK TWO OR THREE TURNS UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
4323-18416-0024 OH I DO SO WISH I MIGHT SHE SAID IT'S SO MUCH FOR A LITTLE GIRL LIKE ME

4323-18416-0033 FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE PICKERING CRIED HIS UNCLE DARTING IN FRONT OF THE CHAIR AND ITS RESTLESS OCCUPANT DON'T SAY THAT THEN
4323-18416-0034 I'VE BEEN A LAZY DOG ALL MY LIFE AND THAT GOOD FOR NOUGHT BUT I HOPE I'VE NOT SUNK TO THAT
4323-55228-0000 THE NEXT MOMENT HE FELL BACK IN AMAZEMENT BEFORE THE IMPETUOUS RUSH OF A STARRY EYED FLUSHED CHEEKED YOUNG GIRL WHO DEMANDED
4323-55228-0001 WHERE IS HE PETE THIS BILLY GASPED THE OLD MAN
4323-55228-0002 AUNT HANNAH'S CHEEKS TOO WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES STARRY BUT WITH DISMAY AND ANGER THE NEXT BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PETE HAD SAID MISS BILLY'S NAME
4323-55228-0003 IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE OTHER FOR PETE TO DO IT OF COURSE IT'S SHE
4323-55228-0004 RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES TO THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE IS HE
4323-55228-0005 INTERPOSED BILLY TELL MISTER BERTRAM I AM HERE OR WAIT I'LL GO WRITE IN AND SURPRISE HIM
4323-55228-0006 PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE TOWARDS AUNT HANNAH THE
4323-55228-0007 MISS BILLY MISS BILLY YOU'RE AN ANGEL STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN YOU ARE YOU ARE BUT I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME
4323-55228-0008 IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT HE'S IN THE VEN MISS BILLY
4323-55228-0009 BILLY TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD TAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARD THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AUNT HANNAH'S IGNORANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BILLY STOP
4323-55228-0010 PETE GO AND TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHED
4323-55228-0011 BUT HIS FACE IS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN HE SPOKE
4323-55228-0012 A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES WERE OPEN
4323-55228-0013 DONGLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN WHICH HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY
4323-55228-0014 IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S EAR LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE
4323-55228-0015 THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT HERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL
4323-55228-0016 AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USIBLE
4323-55228-0017 WHY OF COURSE STAMMERED BILLY I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU HAD FOUND OUT YOU DID N'T WANT ME
4323-55228-0018 DEMANDED BERTRAM AM ANGRY AND MYSTIFIED
4323-55228-0019 AS FOR MY NOT PAINTING AGAIN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE DEAR BOY
4323-55228-0020 SHE PULLED HERSELF HALF AWAY FROM BERTRAM'S ENCIRCLING
4323-55228-0021 BILLY GREW A QUIVERING SIGH
4323-55228-0022 GOOD HEAVENS IS KATE IN THIS TOO BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS SAVAGE THEN
4323-55228-0023 WELL SHE WROTE ONE LETTER
4323-55228-0024 JIMMY LAUGHED GAILY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES
4323-55228-0025 AND WE NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM
4323-55228-0026 HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWING OF HER EYELIDS
4323-55228-0027 BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED A QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHTS
4323-55228-0028 AFTER A MINUTE BILLY STRETCHED AND SIGHED HAPPILY
4323-55228-0029 YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH YOU MISTER ARKWRIGHT
4323-55228-0030 AND AND YOU DIDN'T CARE AS SPECIALLY FOR FOR MISS WINTHROP
4323-55228-0031 BILLY PUT A SOFT FINGER ON ITS LIPS
4323-55228-0032 BERTRAM KISSED THE FINGER AND THE SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED
4323-55228-0033 WELL WHAT IS THAT IS THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM CALMLY
4323-55228-0034 THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERTRAM SAID
4323-55228-0035 AND BILLY I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY
4323-55228-0036 I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL THEN YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR SEE SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY
4323-55228-0037 I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW I'LL GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUND THAT LOVE I FORGOT
4323-55228-0038 OH FIVE DAYS INDEED SIR
4323-55228-0039 I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK I CAN GET READY TO BE MARRIED IN FIVE DAYS
4323-55228-0040 DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MAIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT
4323-55228-0041 IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOLLIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE BUT
4323-55228-0042 BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAM CRAFTIE
4323-55228-0043 THIS TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT
4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART AND SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GOOD LEFT ARM
4323-55228-0045 I BILLY MY DEAR
4323-55228-0046 THERE WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER
4323-55228-0047 WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE IT
4323-55228-0048 YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE OCTOBER AND
4323-55228-0049 THE AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNCERTAINLY
4323-55228-0050 YES SIR NODDED BILLY DEMURELY
4323-55228-0051 YES I KNOW THAT THERE IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM MERRILY
4323-55228-0052 HE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW
4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE REMAINED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO A ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFIL
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM DO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS CELLAR'D DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT
4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT TO REGENT'S PARK
4515-11057-0005 HE HAD FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT
4515-11057-0006 HE WROTE TO MARIAN A
4515-11057-0007 WILL YOU LET ME HEAR FOR COME AND SEE ME
4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF THE BIFFIN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GET ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
4515-11057-0010 I HOPED YO WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
4515-11057-0011 POVERTY I CAN ONLY ASSUME
4515-11057-0012 BUT I WILL SEE WHELKDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFIN FOR A LONG TIME
4515-11057-0013 WAS HE STILL SO VERY PALE
4515-11057-0014 ASKED AMY COMPASSIONABLY
4515-11057-0015 I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FADED UTTERLY
4515-11057-0016 YET IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS THOUGHT
4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW YOU ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
4515-11057-0019 WE HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
4515-11057-0020 AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRIGHT WOMEN
4515-11057-0021 BUT ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
4515-11057-0022 WHAT IS IT SO SERIOUS
4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
4515-11057-0024 OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT THAT
4515-11057-0025 HE HAD PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDENTLY
4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBTS I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE
4515-11057-0027 THERE WAS NOT SILENCE
4515-11057-0028 THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
4515-11057-0029 RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU ONCE KNEW ME
4515-11057-0030 JUST NOW I AM AT NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT
4515-11057-0031 YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN MY OWN WORK RECENTLY
4515-11057-0032 DO YOU SEE MY THINGS AND THE CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY
4515-11057-0033 SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU HERE THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
4515-11057-0034 HER STORY IN THAT SCHOOL'S PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
4515-11057-0035 AND THEN I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
4515-11057-0036 I SURMISE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF SHOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
4515-11057-0037 OH DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED
4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT WITH PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT CAN I DO
4515-11057-0039 THE CASE IS SO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE
4515-11057-0040 WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRIBBING
4515-11057-0041 AGAIN JASPER SHOWED THE WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT
4515-11057-0042 YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REFLECTION MADE HIM ANGRY
4515-11057-0043 MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS STRUGGLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF MY HEART
4515-11057-0045 HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY AH
4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN AND ADDED
4515-11057-0047 THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE MATTER
4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN WHAT A
4515-11057-0049 YOU ARE A BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER
4515-11057-0050 OR OF A BRUTE YOU MEAN
4515-11057-0051 YOU DO VERY WELL I DON'T
4515-11057-0052 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR DEFENCE HE WENT ON PRESENTLY
4515-11057-0053 NEXT
4515-11057-0054 CAN YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE
4515-11057-0055 YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT AND
4515-11057-0056 I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER I
4515-11057-0057 SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY OH
4515-11057-0058 DEAR I CAN'T FEEL IT COULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND
4515-11057-0059 HAS ONE THING OCCURRED TO US
4515-11057-0060 WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IT IS MISSUS MILVAIN
4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT HAS BEFORE HIM
4515-11057-0062 SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND THEN REFLECTED
4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU WERE OUR WIFE
4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO SAY
4515-11057-0065 ACCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SECRET
4515-11057-0066 DO YOU THINK THIS INSURMOUNTABLE
4515-11057-0067 THAT'S JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH
4515-11057-0068 I DON'T TRUST MYSELF NOW
4515-11057-0069 BUT SHALL YOU NOT FACE THEM WILLINGLY
4515-11057-0070 PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MARIAN AND
4515-11057-0071 WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF THE RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN THEM
4515-11057-0073 WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS TRUE
4515-11057-0074 IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING I DISTRUST YOURSELF
4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARIANNA
4515-11057-0076 THAT AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS
4515-11057-0077 I DO WISH HE
4515-11057-0078 HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM THAT HIS VOICE TREMBLED
4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER FREEDOM FOR HER PARENTS
4515-11057-0080 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME THAT
4515-11057-0081 IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR THE FATHER
4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIAN I CAN'T STOP IT
4515-11057-0083 I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU ALL
4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT FANNY TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
4515-11057-0085 NOT MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING
4515-11057-0086 IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISH SELFISHNESS
4515-11057-0087 BUT I COULDN'T SAY A THING THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
4515-11057-0088 AND YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
4515-11057-0089 YOU HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY FATE
4515-11057-0090 IS IT IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
4515-11057-0091 BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED HIM BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
4515-11057-0092 IF I MAY BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU
4515-11057-0093 WHAT CAN HE SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW
4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT IS WHAT IT'S COME TO
4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE MIGHT REVOLT AGAINST IT
4515-11057-0096 WHO CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS A TRUTH
4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS NOT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME
4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH WE
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND THEN WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST
4515-11057-0101 JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY WHY
4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM SHE
4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARIAN I CAN'T WORK
4515-11057-0104 I MUST SAY I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
4515-11057-0105 A GOOD BYE SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
4515-11057-0106 THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TABLE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH IT HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN THE TONES AND ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HER
4515-11057-0110 YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER AS REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND OH SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOU ARE THE ONLY WIFE I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PAST BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO OUR TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THIS PROBLEM
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLY WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR OUR ARTILLERY
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LIFE
4570-102353-0005 UNDER THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
4570-102353-0006 AND AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTEE IN THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT IN ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE BEING THAT OF SIZE
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT FIFTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO WATER IT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 AND PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THAT LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HOUND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON THE LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEETLE
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED BY THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTER HOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE

4831-25894-0027 GIVE THESE TO YOUR BROTHERS SAID THE FAIRY PRINCE STUFFING NUTS AND ORANGES INTO TESSA'S HANDS
4831-25894-0028 AH SO KIND SO VERY KIND I HAVE NO WAY TO SAY THANK YOU BUT RANZA SHALL BE FOR YOU A HEAVENLY ANGEL AND I WILL SING MY HEART OUT FOR YOUR TREE CRIED TESSA FOLDING THE MITTENS AS IF SHE WOULD SAY A PRAYER OF THANKFULNESS IF SHE KNEW HOW
4831-25894-0029 SHE GOT UP EARLY TO SEE IF THE SOCKS WERE ALL RIGHT AND THERE SHE FOUND THE MOST ASTONISHING LIGHT
4831-25894-0030 FOUR SOCKS INSTEAD OF THREE AND BY THE FOURTH PINNED OUT QUITE ELEGANTLY WAS A LITTLE DRESS EVIDENTLY MEANT FOR HER A WARM WOOLLEN DRESS ALL MADE AND EASILY WITH BRIGHT BUTTONS ON IT
4831-25894-0031 TESSA SCREAMED AND DANCED IN HER DELIGHT AND UP TUMBLED ALL THE CHILDREN TO SCREAM AND DANCES WITH HER MAKING A REGULAR CARNIVAL ON A SMALL SCALE
4831-25894-0032 IN HER LONG STOCKING SHE FOUND ALL SORTS OF TREASURES FOR TOMMO HAD STUFFED IT FULL OF QUEER THINGS AND HIS MOTHER HAD MADE GINGERBREAD INTO EVERY IMAGINABLE SHAPE FROM FAT PILLS TO FULL OMNIBUSES
4831-25894-0033 LITTLE RONCHO WAS ACCEPTED WITH DELIGHT BY THE KIND LADY AND HER CHILDREN AND TESSA LEARNED THE SONG QUITE EASILY
4831-25894-0034 AROSE FROM THE CROWD OF CHILDREN GATHERED FROM THE FESTIVAL
4831-25894-0035 BEFORE THEY WENT HOME THE KIND MAMMA TOLD TESSA SHE SHOULD BE THEIR FRIEND AND GAVE HER A MOTHERLY KISS WHICH WARMED THE CHILD'S HEART AND SEEMED TO SET A SEAL UPON THAT PROMISE
4831-29134-0000 THE PRISONER TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE PULPIT WITH THE MINISTER ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL ON THE OTHER
4831-29134-0001 SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE PRESENCE OF A LIVING UNITED STATES SENATOR THAT DURING SEVERAL MINUTES NOT A SPITBALL WAS THROWN
4831-29134-0002 AFTER THAT THEY BEGAN TO COME TO THEMSELVES BY DEGREES AND PRESENTLY THE SPELL WAS WHOLLY GONE AND THEY WERE RECITING VERSES AND PULLING WATER
4831-29134-0003 THE USUAL SUNDAY SCHOOL EXERCISES WERE HURRIED THROUGH AND THEN THE MINISTER GOT UP AND BORED THE HOUSE WITH A SPEECH BUILT ON THE CUSTOMARY SUNDAY SCHOOL PLAN THEN THE SUPERINTENDENT PUT IN HIS OAR THEN THE TOWN DIGNITARIES HAD THE SAY
4831-29134-0004 AM I IN SOME POPULOUS CENTRE OF MY OWN COUNTRY WHERE THE CHOICEST CHILDREN OF THE LAND HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND BROUGHT TOGETHER AS AT A FAIR FOR A PRIDE NO
4831-29134-0005 THEN WHERE AM I ELSE WHERE AM I
4831-29134-0006 HIS SOUL IS LOST IN WONDER AT THE THOUGHT
4831-29134-0007 WATER HAS NO HIGHER NO GRANDER POSITION FOR ME
4831-29134-0008 THEN WHAT IS IT WHAT DID MY CONSCIOUSNESS EXPECT
4831-29134-0009 AH THINK OF THAT NOW I COULD HARDLY KEEP THE TEARS BACK I WAS SO GREATLY
4831-29134-0010 THEY COULD NOT GIVE HIM A COSTLY EDUCATION BUT THEY WERE GOOD AND WISE AND THEY SENT HIM TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL HE LOVED THIS SUNDAY SCHOOL
4831-29134-0011 I HOPE YOU LOVE YOUR SUNDAY SCHOOL AYE SEE BY YOUR FACES AS YOU DO THAT IS RIGHT
4831-29134-0012 ALWAYS LOVE YOUR DAUGHTERS MY CHILDREN FOR THEY LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN KNOW NOW
4831-29134-0013 AND BY AND BY THE PEOPLE MADE HIM GOVERNOR AND HE SAY IT WAS ALL OWING TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
4831-29134-0014 WHY THE PEOPLE GAVE HIM A TOWERING ILLUSTRIOUS POSITION A STRONG IMPOSING POSITION
4831-29134-0015 IT WAS SENATOR OF THE STATES
4831-29134-0016 THAT POOR LITTLE BOY THAT LEFT HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL BECAME THAT MAN THAT MAN STANDS BEFORE ME
4831-29134-0017 ABOVE ALL THINGS MY CHILDREN BE CONSTANT
4831-29134-0018 WHEN SENATOR DILWORTHY DEPARTED FROM CADYLLVILLE HE LEFT THREE DOZEN BOYS BEHIND HIM ARRANGING A CAMPAIGN OF LIFE WHOSE OBJECTIVE POINT WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATE
5543-27761-0000 LULETCHKA WAS A DELIGHTED CHILD
5543-27761-0001 THERE WAS NO OTHER SUCH CHILD THERE NEVER HAD BEEN AND THEN NEVER WOULD BE
5543-27761-0002 LULETCHIKA'S MOTHER SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA WAS SURE OF THAT
5543-27761-0003 LULLETHA'S EYES WERE DARK AND LARGE HER CHEEKS WERE ROSY HER LIPS WERE MADE FOR KISSES AND FOR LAUGHTER
5543-27761-0004 BUT IT WAS NOT THESE CHARMS IN LANETCHKA THAT GAVE HER MOTHER THE KEENEST JOY
5543-27761-0005 SHE FELT COLD AT HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0006 HE WAS ALWAYS FRESH AND COOL WITH A FRIGID SMILE AND WHEREVER HE PASSED COLD CURRENTS USED TO MOVE IN THE AIR
5543-27761-0007 IT EVEN SEEMED TO AUNT SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER FUTURE HUSBAND AND THIS MADE HER HAPPY
5543-27761-0008 THE BRIDE WAS ALSO GOOD LOOKING SHE WAS A TALL DARK EYED DARK HAIRED GIRL SOMEWHAT TINY BUT VERY TACTFUL
5543-27761-0009 HE HAD CONNECTIONS AND HIS WIFE CAME OF THE GOOD INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE
5543-27761-0010 HE MIGHT AT THE PROPER OPPORTUNITY PROVE USEFUL
5543-27761-0011 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THERE WAS NOTHING OF THE MANNER OF SERGEY MOROSTOVITCH TO SUGGEST ANYTHING WRONG TO HIS WIFE
5543-27761-0012 LATER HOWEVER WHEN HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD SERGEY MOLOSTOVITCH ESTABLISHED CONNECTIONS ELSEWHERE OF A LIGHT AND COMFORTABLE NATURE
5543-27761-0013 SAREFIMA ALEXANDROVNA FOUND THIS OUT AND TO HER OWN ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY HURT SHE AWAITED HER INFANT WITH A RESTLESS ANTICIPATION THAT SWALLOWED EVERY OTHER FEELING
5543-27761-0014 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA DRIFTED FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THEM
5543-27761-0015 LUTISHKA THEN RAN AWAY STAMPING WITH HER PLUMP LITTLE LEGS OVER THE CARPETS AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR HER BED
5543-27761-0016 WHERE'S MY BABY GIRL THE MOTHER ASKED AS SHE LOOKED FOR LULLATCHKA AND MADE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID NOT SEE HER
5543-27761-0017 THEN SHE CAME OUT A LITTLE FARTHER AND HER MOTHER AS THOUGH SHE HAD ONLY JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SEIZED HER BY HER LITTLE SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED JOYOUSLY HERE SHE IS MY LA PETCHKA
5543-27761-0018 HER MOTHER'S EYES GLOWED WITH PAINFUL EMOTION
5543-27761-0019 HER WIFE WENT TO HIDE
5543-27761-0020 LUETCHKA TURNED AWAY AS THOUGH NOT TO SEE BUT WATCHED HER MAMMOSHKA STEALTHILY ALL THE TIME
5543-27761-0021 WHERE IS MAMA MOTCHKA ASKED LUETSHKA
5543-27761-0022 A SMILE OF ABSOLUTE BLISS PLAYED ON HER GREY LIPS
5543-27761-0023 LU LECHKA WAS GETTING NEAR HER MOTHER'S CORNER
5543-27761-0024 HER MOTHER WAS GROWING MORE ABSORBED EVERY MOMENT BY HER INTEREST IN THE GAME HER HEART BEAT WITH SHORT QUICK STROKES AND SHE PRESSED EVEN CLOSER TO THE WALL AND DISARRANGING HER HAIR STILL MORE
5543-27761-0025 VALETSHKA SUDDENLY GLANCED TOWARD HER MOTHER'S CORNER AND SCREAMED WITH JOY
5543-27761-0026 THROUGH THE HALF CLOSED DOORS HE HEARD THE LAUGHTER THE JOYOUS OUTCRIES THE SOUND OF ROMING
5543-27761-0027 EVEN PHIDOCIA FELT ABASHED NOW FOR HER MISTRESS NOW FOR HERSELF
5543-27761-0028 HE LIKED COMING HERE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED THIS WAS DONE BY SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA WHO LIKED TO SURROUND HER LITTLE GIRL FROM HER VERY INFANCY ONLY WITH THE LOVELIEST THINGS
5543-27761-0029 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA DRESSED HERSELF TASTEFULLY THIS TOO SHE DID FOR LULLETTECHKA WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW
5543-27761-0030 ONE THING SERGEY MOOLSTOVITCH HAD NOT BECOME RECONCILED TO AND THIS WAS HIS WIFE'S ALMOST CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN THE NURSERY
5543-27761-0031 IT'S JUST AS I THOUGHT I KNEW THAT I'D FIND YE HERE HE SAID WITH A DERISIVE AND CONDESCENDING SMILE
5543-27761-0032 MERELY WE SEE THAT THE CHILD SHOULD FEEL ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY HE EXPLAINED IN ANSWER TO SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA'S PUZZLED GLANCE
5543-27761-0033 SHE'S REALLY SO LITTLE SAID SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0034 I DON'T INSIST IT'S YOUR GRANDMOTHER HERE
5543-27761-0035 BUT I'LL THINK IT OVER HIS WIFE ANSWERED SMILING AS HE DID COLDLY BUT GENIALLY
5543-27761-0036 AGAIN THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0037 THAT THE MISTRESS DOES IT WELL'S ONE THING BUT THAT THE YOUNG LADY DOES IT THAT'S BAD
5543-27761-0038 WHY ASKED FEDOSY WITH CURIOSITY
5543-27761-0039 THIS EXPRESSION OF CURIOSITY GAVE HER FACE THE LOOK OF A WOODEN ROUGHLY PAINTED DOCK
5543-27761-0040 YES THAT'S BAD REPEATED AGATHYO WITH CONVICTION TERRIBLY BAD OH
5543-27761-0041 IT'S THE TRUTH I'M SAYING REMEMBERING MY WORDS AGATHEA WENT ON WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE AND SECRECY
5543-27761-0042 BUT IT'S THE SUREST SIGN
5543-27761-0043 THE OLD WOMAN HAD INVENTED THE SIGN QUITE SUDDENLY HERSELF SHE WAS EVIDENTLY VERY PROUD OF IT
5543-27761-0044 NOW MADAM SHE SAID QUIETLY IN A TREMBLING VOICE
5543-27761-0045 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVITCH GAVE A START
5543-27761-0046 FEDOSCHA'S FACE MADE HER ANXIOUS
5543-27761-0047 WHAT IS IT FEDOSYA SHE ASKED WITH GREAT CONCERN IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH LUELETCHKA
5543-27761-0048 NO MADAME SAID MEDOSIA AS SHE GESTICULATED WITH HER HANDS TO REASSURE HER MISTRESS AND TO MAKE HER SIT DOWN
5543-27761-0049 LUTCHKAS ASLEEP MAY GOD BE WITH HER
5543-27761-0050 ONLY I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING YOU SEE LUDETCHKA IS ALWAYS HIDING HERSELF THAT IS NOT GOOD
5543-27761-0051 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BAD IT IS SAID SEDOSIA AND HER FACE EXPRESSED THE MOST DECIDED CONFIDENCE
5543-27761-0052 I UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING I
5543-27761-0053 YOU SEE MADAME IT'S A KIND OF OMEN EXPLAINS FEDOSSA ABRUPTLY IN A SHAMEFACED WAY
5543-27761-0054 NONSENSE SAID KARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0055 WHO TOLD YOU ALL THIS ASKED SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA WITH AN AUSTERE LOW VOICE
5543-27761-0056 KNOWS EXCLAIMED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA IN IRRITATION AS THOUGH SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HERSELF SOMEHOW FROM A SUDDEN ANXIETY
5543-27761-0057 WHAT NONSENSE AS THOUGH LUTETCHKA COULD DIE
5543-27761-0058 SHE SAW CLEARLY THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN A CHILD'S QUITE ORDINARY DIVERSION AND A CONTINUATION OF A CHILD'S LIFE
5543-27761-0059 SHE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT THAT EVENING TO OCCUPY HER MIND WITH OTHER MATTERS BUT HER THOUGHTS TURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO THE FACT THAT LULLEDCHKA LOVED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0060 WHEN LULATCHKA WAS STILL QUITE SMALL AND HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HER NURSE SHE SOMETIMES SITTING IN HER NURSE'S ARMS MADE A SUDDEN ROGUISH GRIMACE AND HID HER LAUGHING FACE IN THE NURSE'S SHOULDER
5543-27761-0061 NOW SHE WOULD LOOK OUT WITH A SLY GLANCE
5543-27761-0062 THOUGH SHE REPROACHED HERSELF AT ONCE FOR THIS UNFOUNDED SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD NOT ENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF LOETCHKA'S FAVORITE GAME AND SHE TRIED TO DIVERT LUETCHKA'S ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0063 SHE ANGRILY COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S NEW WISHES
5543-27761-0064 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA TRIED DESPERATELY TO AMUSE LULETZKA
5543-27761-0065 PERHAPS THOUGHT SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA SHE IS QUITE AS STRONGLY DRAWN TO THE WORLD AS OTHER CHILDREN WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY MANY THINGS
5543-27761-0066 IF THIS IS SO IS IT NOT A SIGN OF ORGANIC UNEASINESS
5543-27761-0067 SARAFIKA ALEXANDROVNA HERSELF BEGAN THE GAME ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH SHE PLAYED IT WITH A HEAVY HEART
5543-27761-0068 AND SHE SUFFERED AS THOUGH COMMITTING AN EVIL DEED WITH FULL CONSCIOUSNESS
5543-27761-0069 IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVITCH
5543-27761-0070 HER MOTHER COVERED HER WITH HIS BLUE BLANKET
5543-27761-0071 LULLOOCHKA DREW HER SWEET LITTLE HANDS FROM UNDER THE BLANKET AND STRETCHED THEM OUT TO EMBRACE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER BENT DOWN
5543-27761-0072 AND SHE SEEMED SO SMALL AND SO FRAIL UNDER THE BLANKET THAT COVERED HER
5543-27761-0073 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA REMAINED STANDING OVER LUETTECHKA'S BED A LONG WHILE AND SHE KEPT LOOKING AT LUETCHKA WITH TENDERNESS AND FEAR
5543-27761-0074 I'M A MOTHER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT HER SHE THOUGHT AS SHE IMAGINED THE VARIOUS ILLS THAT MIGHT BEFALL ALATCHKA
5543-27761-0075 SHE PRAYED LONG THAT NIGHT BUT HIS PRAYER DID NOT RELIEVE HER SADNESS
5543-27761-0076 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED LUNETCHKA CAUGHT COLD
5543-27761-0077 THEIR FEVER CAME UPON HER AT NIGHT
5543-27761-0078 WHEN SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA AWAKENED BY FEDOSYA CAME TO L'OLETCHKA AND SAW HER LOOKING SO HOT SO RESTLESS AND SO TORMENTED SHE INSTANTLY RECALLED THE EVIL OMEN AND A HOPELESS DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS
5543-27761-0079 A DOCTOR WAS CALLED AND EVERYONE WAS DONE THAT IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS BUT THE INEVITABLE HAPPENED
5543-27761-0080 AND LUTZKA GREW FEEBLER FROM HOUR TO HOUR
5543-27761-0081 NOTHING MADE HER SO UNHAPPY AS THE REITERATIONS OF FEDOSYA UTTERED BETWEEN SOBS SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF AROOLIECHKA
5543-27761-0082 FEVER WAS CONSUMING LUMETCHKA AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND SPOKE IN DELIRIUM
5543-27761-0083 BUT THREE DAYS PASSED TORTURING LIKE A NIGHTMARE
5543-27761-0084 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA HID HER FACE BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR LULETTKA'S BED HOW TRAGIC
5543-27761-0085 AWAIT MA MOTCHKA WHISPERED LULLUTZKA
5543-27761-0086 MOMOTCHKA'S WHITE FACE BECAME BLURRED AND EVERYTHING GREW DARK BEFORE LULLATCHKA
5543-27761-0087 THAT SHE MET HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0088 SARAFINO ALEXANDROVNA WAS STANDING BY THE COFFIN AND LOOKING DULLY AT HER DEAD CHILD
5543-27761-0089 SISIA MY DEAR DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF SAID SERGEY MOLOSTOVITCH IN A WHISPER
5543-27761-0090 YOU MUST RESIGN YOURSELF INTO YOUR FATE
5543-27761-0091 SHE'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE PERSISTED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA HER EYES FIXED ON THE DEAD LITTLE GIRL
5543-27761-0092 SERGEY MOROTOOVITCH LOOKED AROUND HIM CAUTIOUSLY HE WAS AFRAID OF THE UNSEEMLY AND OF THE RIDICULOUS
5543-27761-0093 CSMA DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF HE REPEATED
5543-27761-0094 HE WAS VERY CONFUSED AND ANNOYED
5543-27761-0095 HER FACE SEEMED TRAGICAL AND HER EYES WERE DRY
5543-27761-0096 SHE WENT INTO THE NURSERY AND BEGAN TO WALK ROUND THE ROOM LOOKING INTO THOSE PLACES WHERE LUMETCHKA USED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0097 SHE WALKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND BENT NOW AND THEN TO LOOK UNDER THE TABLE OR UNDER THE BED AND KEPT ON REPEATING CHEERFULLY WHERE'S MY LITTLE ONE WHERE IS MY LULLETCHKA
5543-27761-0098 AFTER SHE HAD WALKED AROUND THE ROOM ONCE SHE BEGAN TO MAKE HER REQUEST ANEW
5543-27761-0099 FEDOSYA MOTIONLESS WITH DEJECTED FACE SAT IN A CORNER AND LOOKED ROUND AT HER MISTRESS THEN SHE SUDDENLY BURST OUT SOBBING AND SHE WAILED LOUDLY
5543-27761-0100 SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LUILETCHKA ER ANGELIC LITTLE SOUL
5543-27761-0101 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOR THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE BETWEEN HER AND LUTOWKA
5543-27761-0102 THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF HEAVINESS IN SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA'S HEAD AS SHE APPROACHED LUDETCHKA
5543-27761-0103 LULUCHKA LAY THERE STILL AND PALE AND SMILED PATHETICALLY
5543-27761-0104 AND LITTLE ONE DID NOT REPLY
5543-27761-0105 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA STOOD UP ERECT SIGHED IN A LOST WAY SMILED AND CALLED LOUDLY LULETCHIKA
5543-27761-0106 LALECHKA IS BEING CARRIED OUT
5849-50873-0000 CAP'N BALL THE COMMANDER OF A SMALL GARRISON AT SEBROOK PERMITTED HIM TO LAND BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO READ HIS COMMISSIONER ORDERED HIM TO BE SILENT
5849-50873-0001 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MISTER PRINCE WADSWORTH ASKED FOR HE COULD SEE THAT THE MAN WAS GREATLY EXCITED GOVERNOR ANDROSE HAS COME AGAIN GASPED MISTER PRINCE WHY SHOULD THAT ALARM US THE FELLOW ALTHOUGH GIVEN TO BOASTING IS NOT DANGEROUS OR LIABLE TO PUT HIS THREATS INTO EXECUTION BUT HE HAS GROWN DANGEROUS DECLARED MISTER PRINCE THE LIBERTIES OF THE COLONY ARE INVOLVED
5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BECAME A LITTLE UNHAPPY THOUGH HE WAS STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THE MATTER LIGHTLY
5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF THEIR POLITICAL RIGHTS
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VICARROY HAD COME TO HARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD DECLARED HE SHALL NOT HAVE THAT
5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN I ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN A HEATED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO ACCEPT THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED IT
5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY DOING ENGAGED AND A DEBATE
5849-50873-0010 AND WILL I WAIT UNTIL IT IS ENDED HE HAS PROMISED TO DO SO
5849-50873-0011 MISTER PRINZ FIXED HIS AMAZED EYES ON THE CAPTAIN'S FACE AND READ THERE A DESPERATE DETERMINATION CAPTAIN HE BEGAN
5849-50873-0012 MISTER PRINCE BOWED AND HASTILY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHENCE THE ASSEMBLY WAS IN SESSION
5849-50873-0013 AS SOON AS THEY WAS GONE CHARLES STEVENS SAID
5849-50873-0014 YET CHARLES YOU WILL ANSWER WHAT DO YOU MEAN UNCLE
5849-50873-0015 NEVER DID DEBATERS TAKE THE GREATER INTEREST IN A MINOR SUBJECT
5849-50873-0016 WHAT DO YOU INTEND DOING UNCLE AND WILL YOU FIGHT THEM
5849-50873-0017 I REMEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT AT THE TIME NOT TOO SOON NOR TOO LATE
5849-50873-0018 THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE CAPTAIN SAID THAT
5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO THE ESTABLISHMENT
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR DECISION
5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PLACE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN LUSWORTH
5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT AS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING A SPECIAL ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE IN THE TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL WE SAW A MAN STATIONED NEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 WHILE THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOW THE FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOW HIM AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED ITS ARM
5849-50873-0028 BOY HAVE A CARE HOW YOU ASK ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN THE CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WADSWORTH THE TRAIN VANCE CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 WHO IS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR CHILDREN AT THE DOOR AND WE HAVE THE TRAINBANDS OF CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
5849-50873-0032 WHAT OF YOU HAS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE WIFE CRIED THE ENRAGED GOVERNOR
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY SHOOK ITS HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE DO NOT KNOW HIM IF HE DOES NOT LIVE IN CONNECTICUT WHERE DOES HE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL ASSISTANT DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD TAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS HOWEVER AFTERWARDS KNOWN AS THE CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIVID BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER FOR HIS SEIZURE OF THE CHARTERS WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN THE ASSEMBLY OF RHODE ISLAND SENT A MOST LOYAL ADDRESS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMALLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADDED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE FORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENSE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG AROUND THEIR FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF A COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTER TO THE EXPULSION OF ANDROSE
5849-50962-0000 CALLED BERTS WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE
5849-50962-0001 IT'S A SCHOONER SAID MISTER BINGHAM TO MISTER MINTURN IF SHE HAS A VERY HEAVY CARGO
5849-50962-0002 TO THESE CORD WAS FASTENED A HEAVY ROPE OR CABLE
5849-50962-0003 WHAT'S THAT BOARD FOR ASKED BERT AS HE SAW A BOARD FORMING THE CABLE
5849-50962-0004 THAT'S THE DIRECTION HE SAID HAL
5849-50962-0005 THEY ARE PRINTED IN A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES AND THEY TELL THE CREW TO CARRY THE END OF THE CABLE HIGH UP ON THE MAST AND FASTEN IT STRONGLY THERE
5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BERT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BUOY WILL GO BACK ON A PULLEY
5849-50962-0007 IT WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MANY OF THE WICKED STORM HAD PASSED
5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS AND WOMEN TO A BEACH
5849-50962-0009 MISSUS BOBBSEY MISSUS MINTURN NELLIE AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND NAN WERE ALL THERE FLOSSIE AND FREDDIE BEING OBLIGED TO GO HOME WITH DINAH AND SUSAN
5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AS BERT AND HAL TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BUOY WAS WITHIN
5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER IT CAME WHEN NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMEN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORKS FOR THE LIFEGUARDS AND A MAN IN THE CORK BELT BANDED UPON SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND NELLY WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FALLING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DROWNED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM THAT THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
5849-50962-0018 AND SAID GEORGE BINGHAM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE BROTHER
5849-50962-0019 SAFE AND WELL CAME THE LOW ANSWER
5849-50962-0020 I GUESSED OUR PRAYERS WERE HEARD LAST NIGHT
5849-50962-0021 HERE COMES ANOTHER MAN EXCLAIMED THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A BIG MAN DASHED OFF THE SANDS
5849-50962-0022 WHILE I'VE DECLARE WE DID LAND ON A FRIENDLY SHORE
5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BINGHAM SAID THE LIFE SAVING WORK TURNED OUT TO BE A SOCIAL AFFAIR FOR THERE WAS A GREAT TIME GREETING NEDIE'S FATHER AND HAL'S UNCLE
5849-50962-0024 AND HAL AND HIS FATHER TOO PUT IN NA
5849-50962-0025 WHAT A MORNING THAT WAS AT SUNSET AND BEACH
5849-50962-0026 I'M SO GLAD WE PRAYED SAID LITTLE FLOSSIE TO FREDDY WHEN SHE HEARD THE GREAT NEWS
5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL THING HAD GROWN OUT OF THAT DREADFUL STORM
5849-50963-0001 AND EVERYBODY WAS SO HAPPY HAPPY
5849-50963-0002 THE NEPTUNE THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON HER SAND BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROWBOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOADS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A FEVER
5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT DELAYED US SOME
5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EACH LOG LOADED ON THE SCHOONER AND WE STARTED OFF
5849-50963-0006 WE COUNTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DREW US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE ASKED MISTER BOBBSEY WHO WAS DOWN FOR THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 THE VALUE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS SHOULD NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 WELL I'M A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE MC GLAUGHLAN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN HER HANDS
5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US A LIFETIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE OWNED IN THIS YEAR
5849-50963-0011 MAYBE AUNT EMILY'LL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOPPING TOUR SUGGESTED NAN
5849-50963-0012 HE MAKE THE CLERKS REMOVE ALL THE TRUCKS FROM THE AISLES AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN
5849-50963-0013 THIS WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FACED AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BYE TO YOU NELLIE TOLD DOROTHY AND NANETTE NEXT MORNING
5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NAN AND
5849-50964-0002 BUT YOU ARE QUITE RICH NOW AREN'T YOU REMARKED DOROTHY
5849-50964-0003 AND DOROTHY WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE HER PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S PROUD SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND SHE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DOROTHY
5849-50964-0005 COME NELLY CALLED MISSUS MC GLAUGHLIN I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAT
5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TO NELLIE TOLD HIM
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE HAS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE US THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MOST OF EM I GUESS ANSWERED BENT
5849-50964-0009 WELL YOU HAVE HAD A GOOD VACATION AND I'M WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED NAN VACATION WAS JUST LONG AGO I THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME BUT NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FREDDY AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP A CAT
5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THAT VACATION
6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICAL
6123-59150-0001 IF DOSTOJEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF NOTE
6123-59150-0003 CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN OR WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 AND HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL AUTHOR
6123-59150-0005 AND THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICTS
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE MOST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE OF NEKHLUDOFF IN RESURRECATION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIED SOME ONE IN THE EDIERS
6123-59150-0009 ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF QUESTIONS
6123-59150-0010 WHEN THE TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SAW HIS VISION DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SUCK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING THE SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND IT TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKI
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ANA CORRENNA OR FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHISE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED A CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE SIMPLICITY AND PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTISTS AND ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
6123-59150-0019 THAT HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES
6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BOWING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING WITH BRUTAL MANIACS
6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSALLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL YOU
6123-59150-0024 BUT IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HOME OF PLENTY
6123-59150-0026 DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFYEVNA EVGENIE PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEOKONSKI AGLAYA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VAYA FERUSHENKO NASTASIA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL YVOLGAN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE RECORD OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES HIS DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THE DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUCTURE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDED DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A PERSON WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE I ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE CLEAR
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE PERIOD OR CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CETTAVOS
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I WILL BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSIONS
6123-59150-0039 OR ONLY BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MISHKIN IN THE IDIOT
6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICTS
6123-59150-0041 THIS NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUGAT DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT HE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC KNIGHTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE COULD ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS
6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATE AND REPELS
6123-59186-0000 HE IT IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST MY CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDEE WAS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS IT EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THUS HE WRITES IN AN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE VILLAGE IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 AND PROSE ENTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM ABOUT
6123-59186-0008 WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE AND VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 CATERED CARE IS AN APPALLING PHRASE
6123-59186-0010 IS A MINE OF GOOD POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE AND THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGHER COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YE DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THERE ARE HINTS OF A GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUOLE MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 HE WAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE SHADOW AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN THE BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES
6123-59186-0016 HIS WORLD IS A FACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED HIM FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S REMEMBRANCE
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD LORNLY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY
6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOON TIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDEY'S POEMS THE OXEN
6123-59186-0022 WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STORY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING NOW
6123-59186-0023 THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHTS IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOOD
6123-59186-0024 HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCHED AWAY
6123-59186-0025 WHY LONG HE CRIES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO
6123-59186-0026 WHEN SHALL THE SANE SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORNED TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS
6123-59186-0027 BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION A SENIOR SOULS FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE
6123-59186-0028 AND GENERAL HELL HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LAWYER AS DOVES
6123-59186-0029 SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM YOUNG LOVES
6123-59186-0030 AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY WELL THEY ON OUR DEEDS
6123-59186-0031 MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF GENEROSITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR
6123-59186-0032 THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE THE HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE
6123-59186-0033 IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDSE'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE
6123-59186-0034 FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE OF EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH
6123-59186-0035 HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS WROUGHT IN THE GRAVE DEED OF THEIR GLORY
6123-59186-0036 LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH AND
6123-59186-0037 IN BEYOND THE LAST NIGHT WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE
6123-59186-0038 NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL UP TO YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES
6123-59186-0039 THEY BRING US A FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN
6123-59186-0040 NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSELIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLNESS OF DULL HUED DAYS
6267-53049-0000 IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHERS ISN'T IT
6267-53049-0001 PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE ALDER SISTER WISTFULLY
6267-53049-0002 DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE DAY
6267-53049-0003 SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMIRED IT OF THE WORLD
6267-53049-0004 SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OFF TO SAY A NEW DRESS
6267-53049-0005 DORIS HUNTER' I BELIEVE IT'S AN OLD QUILT
6267-53049-0006 YOU LISTEN PENELOPE MY DEAR DORIS
6267-53049-0007 LOVE TO PENELOPER AND YOURSELF
6267-53049-0008 YOUR AFFECTIONATE AND AUNT ADELA HUNTER
6267-53049-0009 I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A VERY
6267-53049-0010 IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY PERHAPS BUT IT IS ALL FADED NOW
6267-53049-0011 TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN
6267-53049-0012 IT WAS VERY KIND OF THE AUNT ADELA TO SEND IT SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY
6267-53049-0013 WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PENELOP
6267-53049-0014 WHAT LOVELY OLD THYMEY STUFF AND NOT A BIT FATTED
6267-53049-0015 I DECLARE IT HAS AS GOOD AS NEW
6267-53049-0016 WELL LET US GO AND HAVE CHEATS SAID PENELOPE I'RE DECIDEDLY HUNGRY
6267-53049-0017 BESIDES I SEE THE POVERTY BOCKERS COMING
6267-53049-0018 IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSES AND HARLL LOOM AFTER ALL
6267-53049-0019 PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY IN THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS A POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH THE GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET
6267-53049-0020 SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY LADY THERE
6267-53049-0021 THE PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER CHARMING
6267-53049-0022 SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SANG TO HERSELF
6267-53049-0023 MY AUNT ADELA GAVE ME LEAVE US THE MATERIALS SHE STAMMERED
6267-53049-0024 I'M NAMED AFTER HER MISSUS FAIRWATER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVELY OWN FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND TENDERNESS
6267-53049-0025 THEN YOU ARE MY GRAND KNIGHT SHE SAID
6267-53049-0026 WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT ROSE BUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN TIBE
6267-53049-0027 PENELOPE I WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER
6267-53049-0028 SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHERS DIED AND OUR HOUSE HOLD WAS BROKEN UP
6267-53049-0029 MY DEAR I AM A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGIN TO ME
6267-53049-0030 NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRWORTHER'S SOFT OLD HANDS AFFECTIONATELY
6267-53049-0031 DORA AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS CHANGED IN THE TWINED CLING OF AN EYE
6267-53049-0032 WHEN MISSUS FAIRWEATHERS HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
6267-65525-0000 AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CRIED TO HER FROM BELOW
6267-65525-0001 AUNT JANE WAS STANDING ON THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BABY CLANGING TO THE OTHER
6267-65525-0002 SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND VULGAR AS A SUNFLOWER BUT AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS
6267-65525-0003 I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BIGGSBY IS THIS EVENING SODDY AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK
6267-65525-0004 SYDNEY SIGHED AND WENT DOWN STAIRS FOR THE PAPER
6267-65525-0005 ALL HER DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
6267-65525-0006 BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED IT TO WRITE HER LETTER
6267-65525-0007 THE ROOM WAS SMALL A LOW BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SYDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS
6267-65525-0008 HER BEDS AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE
6267-65525-0009 JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A PEA AND THE MOUTH ZIG ZAGED FROM EAR TO EAR
6267-65525-0010 SYDNEY HATED THAT MIRROR AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD HATE NOTHING
6267-65525-0011 HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SYDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF HIS DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID
6267-65525-0012 PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO EAT WITH A FLUSH OF REAL EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE
6267-65525-0013 ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO ELLEN DOUGLAS AND THAT WAS FORWARDED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFFERING EDITOR OF THE MAPLES LEAF
6267-65525-0014 HE WROTE THAT ALTHOUGH HIS AGE DIVERRED HIM FROM MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB HE WAS TWENTY AND THE LIMIT WAS EIGHTEEN HE READ THE LETTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH MUCH INTEREST AND OFTEN HAD THOUGHT OF ANSWERING SOME OF THE REQUESTS FOR CORRESPONDENTS
6267-65525-0015 HE NEVER HAD DONE SO BUT ELLEN DOUGLAS'S LETTER WAS SO INTERESTED THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO WRITE TO HER
6267-65525-0016 WOULD SHE BE KING ENOUGH TO CORRESPOND HIM
6267-65525-0017 HE WAS TWO YEARS OUT FROM THE EAST AND HAD NOT YET FORGOTTEN TO BE HOMES SICK AT TIMES
6267-65525-0018 SYDNEY LIKED THE LETTER AND ANSWER IT
6267-65525-0019 SHE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET JOHN LINCOLN NOR DID SHE WISH TO SAY SO
6267-65525-0020 IN THE CORRESPONDENCE ITSELF I FOUND HER PLEASURE
6267-65525-0021 JOHN LINCOLN WROTE BREEZY ACCOUNTS OF MARRIAGE LIFE AND ADVENTURES ON THE FAR WESTERN PLAINS SO ALIEN AND REMOTE FROM SNUG HUMDRUM PLANEFIELD LIFE THAT SYDNEY ALWAYS HAD THE SENSATION OF CROSSING A GULF WHEN SHE OPENED A LETTER FROM THE BAR AND AS FOR SYDNEY'S OWN LETTER THIS IS THE WAY IT READ AS SHE WROTE IT
6267-65525-0022 THE EVERGREENS PLAINSFIELD DEAR MISTER LINCOLN
6267-65525-0023 I LOVE LIFE AND ITS BLOOM AND BRILLIANCY I LOVE MEETINGS NEW PEOPLE I LOVE THE RIPPLE OF MUSIC THE HUM OF LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION
6267-65525-0024 THE MAN I HAD BEEN TALKING WITH WAS PAUL MOORE THE NEW NOVELIST
6267-65525-0025 AS IT WAS I HAD CONTRADICTED HIM TWICE AND HE HAD LAUGHED AND LIKED IT BUT HIS BOOKS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A NEW MEANING TO ME HENCEFORTH THROUGH THIS INSIGHT HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN ME
6267-65525-0026 IT IS SUCH MEETINGS AS THESE THAT GIVE LIFE ITS SPARKLES FOR ME

6467-97061-0012 AND SHE HUMBLY BOWING DOWN SAID LET MY LORD PARDON HIS SERVANT FOR THE INJURY WHICH SHE HAS UNCONSCIOUSLY CAUSED
6467-97061-0013 I AM AN APSYRUS BORN FROM THE RAYS OF THE SUN
6467-97061-0014 ONE DAY AS I WAS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR WEARING A WHITE DRESSE A SWAN MISTAKING ME FOR A LOTUS FLOWER ATTACKED ME
6467-97061-0015 IN HIS ANGER HE CURSED ME SAYING O WICKED ONE FOR THIS OFFENSE YOU ARE CONDEMNED TO BE CHANGED INTO A PIECE OF UNCONSCIOUS CATTLE
6467-97061-0016 THE CHANGE TOOK PLACE IMMEDIATELY AND I FELL TO THE GROUND DOWN INTO A SILVER CHAIN
6467-97061-0017 ON HIS WAY HE SAW THE SILVER FETTLE ASCENDED TO THE GROUND PICKED IT UP AND CONTINUED HIS FLIGHT
6467-97061-0018 THE SLAYER OF GENDRAVAMMA HEARING THIS CAME OUT OF THE PALACE AND QUICKLY MOUNTING THE ELEPHANT WHO HELD OUT HIS TRUNK TO RECEIVE HIM PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE PRINCE
6467-97061-0019 A GREAT WAS THEIR MUTUAL ASTONISHMENT AND JOY WHEN THEY RECOGNISED EACH OTHER THE PRINCE EXCLAIMING IS IT POSSIBLE
6467-97061-0020 IS IT REALLY YOU MY DEAR FRIEND AHARA ALMAH WHO HAVE DONE THE DEED
6467-97061-0021 THROUGH THESE THEY FORCED THEIR WAY EMPLOYING WITH GOOD EFFECTS THE WEAPONS PLACED UPON THE ELEPHANT FOR THE USE OF GENDRAMA
6467-97061-0022 BEFORE HOWEVER THEY HAD GONE FAR THEY HEARD THE NOISE OF BATTLE AT A DISTANCE AND SAW THE SOLDIERS IN FRONT OF THEM SCATTERED INTO ALL DIRECTIONS
6467-97061-0023 WE HAVE JUST NOW ENCOUNTERED AND UTTERLY DEFEATED THE ENEMY SO THAT THERE IS NO NEED OF ANY FURTHER RESISTANCE
6467-97061-0024 RAJAMANHA AGREED TO THAT
6599-38590-0000 WHATEVER HAND IT WAS THAT SHOT DOWN BOURBON RAOUL AFTER HIS DEATH WAS PLUNDERED DEVASTATED AND RAVAGED BY A BRUTAL GREEDY LICENTIOUS AND FANATICAL SOLDIERY
6599-38590-0001 WHEREFORE FOR THE FUTURE WRITE US NOTHING AT ALL BUT APPOINT US THE TIME AND PLACE OF MEETING AND WE WILL BRING OUR SWORD FOR YOU TO CROSS PROTESTING THAT THE SHAME OF ANY DELAY OF FIGHTING SHALL BE YOURS SEEING THAT WHEN IT COMES TO AN ENCOUNTER THERE IS AN END OF ALL WRITING
6599-38590-0002 SIR ANSWERED THE SPANIARD PERMIT ME TO DO MY OFFICE AND PAY WHAT THE EMPEROR HAS CHARGED ME TO SAY
6599-38590-0003 NAY I WILL NOT LISTEN TO THEE SAYS FRANCIS IF THOU DO NOT FIRST GIVE ME A PATENT SIGNED BY THY MASTER CONTAINING AN APPOINTMENT OF TIME AND PLACE SIR I HAVE ORDERS TO READ YOU THE CARTEL AND GIVE IT YOU AFTERWARDS
6599-38590-0004 BURGUNDY WITHOUT BEING PUT OUT BEGAN AND AGAIN SIR
6599-38590-0005 NAY SAID FRANCES I WILL NOT SUFFER HIM TO SPEAK TO ME BEFORE HE HAS GIVEN ME ANY APPOINTMENT OF TIME AND PLACE
6599-38590-0006 GIVE IT ME OR RETURN AS THOU HAST BEEN
6599-38590-0007 I AM QUITE WILLING SAID THE KING LET I HAVE IT
6599-38590-0008 THE PIECE OF CAMBREY WAS CALLED THE LAD'S PIECE IN HONOUR OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO HAD NEGOTIATED IT THOUGH MORALLY DIFFERENT AND OF VERY UNEQUAL WORTH THEY BOTH HAD MINDS OF A RARE ORDER AND TRAINED TO RECOGNISE POLITICAL NECESSITIES AND NOT TO ATTEMPT ANY BUT POSSIBLE SUCCESSES
6599-38590-0009 ALL THE GREAT POLITICAL ACTORS SEEMED HURRYING AWAY FROM THE STAGE AS IF THE DRAMA WERE APPROACHING HIS END
6599-38591-0000 IN FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO AT THE BATTLE OF DRURO HE WAS AGED AND SO ILL THAT NONE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM ON HORSEBACK
6599-38591-0001 HE FULLY ARMED SAVE ONLY HIS HEAD ANSWERED HIM RIGHT WELL SIR THIS IS THE REAL MEDICINE THAT HATH CURED ME FOR THE BATTLE WHICH IS TOWARD AND A PRAYING FOR THE HONOUR OF GOD IN OUR CAMP
6599-38591-0002 THE LADY'S PEACE CONCLUDED AT CAMBRAY IN FIFTEEN TWENTY NINE LASTED UP TO FIFTEEN THIRTY SIX INCESSANTLY TROUBLED HOWEVER BY FAR FROM PACIFIC SENTIMENTS PROCEEDINGS AND PREPARATIONS
6599-38591-0003 AT LAST HE DECIDED INTO RETREATING
6599-38591-0004 IT WAS GARCILASO DE LA VEGA THE PRINCE OF SPANISH POSEY THE SPANISH PATRARCH ACCORDING TO HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN
6599-38591-0005 MONTMORENCE SIGNED A SIMILAR ONE FOR PIEDMA
6599-38591-0006 THEY ALL REPAIRED TOGETHER TO THE HOUSE PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND AFTER DINNER THE EMPEROR BEING TIRED LAY DOWN TO REST ON A COUCH THAT QUEEN ELEANOR BEFORE LONG WENT AND TAPPED AT HIS DOOR AND SENT WORD TO THE KING THAT THE EMPEROR WAS AWAKE
6599-38591-0007 FRANCES WITH THE CARDINAL DE LORRAINES AND THE CONSTABLE DE MONTMORENCY SOON ARRIVED
6599-38591-0008 ON ENTERING THE CHAMBER HE FOUND THE EMPEROR STILL LYING DOWN AND CHATTING WITH HIS SISTER THE QUEEN WHO WAS SEATED BESIDE THEM ON A CHAIR
6599-38591-0009 OH YES SAID CHARLES I HAD MADE SUCH CHEER THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SLEEP IT OFF
6599-38591-0010 FRANCIS DID THE CONVERSE WITH HIS OWN CALL
6599-38591-0011 ONLY SEVEN OF THE ATTENDANTS REMAINED IN THE EMPEROR'S CHAMBER AND THERE THE TWO SERVANTS CONVERSED FOR AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THEY MOVED TO THE HALL WHERE A SPLENDID SUPPER AWAITED THEM
6599-38591-0012 THE GHENTS PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE WHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE ARE RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ACCESSION
6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND THEN DROPPED BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALLED A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THEIR STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S SORE BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE RAMOUDA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDED CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE COWS WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WAS TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE ON THE SALT GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO WOULD GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASE WOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILDING A FIRE THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIND GATE AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J H STAMPIN IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON HER HEELS ALONG THE FENCE SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTING TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED ACROSS AND ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODTEN AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISHERMAN
6841-88291-0013 HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SET OVER IN ONE STRIP TO AVOID THE TIGHTER LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 NOBODY EVER PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HEART STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULL DOGGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCES UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLUPPED OVER FROM ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 THOUGHT THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO TAKE THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULL DOGGER
6841-88291-0021 MARKER YELLED THE
6841-88291-0022 THE BRANDA PRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF PLAIDED A LITTLE LEST THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRANCO CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOUR TO INDICATE DUE PEELING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED UP A SWALLOW TAIL ON THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLE HAS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDON
6841-88291-0027 UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT PAINFUL AND COULD SOME OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO DOUBT IT IN PREFERENCE
6841-88291-0028 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FILLED THE SPREAD OF THIS DOCTRINE THROUGH ARIZONA
6841-88291-0029 IMAGINE A PINCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TAGS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR IN A ROUNDUP
6841-88291-0030 A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEEDING OR TO LOOKIN IDLY ABOUT
6841-88291-0031 BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT NOT TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD OUR TEETH FILLED
6841-88291-0032 ONE OF THE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS BUT A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEGS BUT TOSSING HIS LOOP OVER ITS NECK
6841-88291-0033 MISTER FROST'S BULL CALF ALONE IN PICTORIAL HISTORY SHOWS THE ACTIONS
6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE IS THE GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERPUTABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER
6841-88291-0035 AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH HIS WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HELD
6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD CATCH HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE VIGOROUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING ON TO THE UPRIGHT
6841-88291-0037 SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
6841-88291-0038 THIS IT IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME FUN IF IT FAILS
6841-88291-0039 BY NOW THE BRANDENS WAS IN FULL SWING
6841-88291-0040 WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID THE CAST OFF
6841-88291-0041 TWO MEN RAN TO AND FRO BUSY AND INTENT
6841-88291-0042 SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR CALVES GREW ON THE GROUND AT ONCE
6841-88291-0043 DUST OUTIED AND DISSIPATED
6841-88291-0044 NO MORE NIPPED CALVES THEY ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0045 THEN HE WOULD SPIT AT HIS HANDS AND GO AT IT ALONE
6841-88291-0046 IF LUCK ATTENDED HIS FIRST EFFORT HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND THERE'S YO LITTLE CALF SAID HE
6841-88291-0047 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THIS FAR WITH YOUR A LITTLE LOAD IRON
6841-88291-0048 TOWARDS NOON THE WORKS SLACKED
6841-88291-0049 PRESENTLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMAN AND REPORTED THE BRANDON FINISHED
6841-88291-0050 THE LATTER COUNTED THE MARKS IN HIS TALLYBOOK
6841-88291-0051 OF ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX HE ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0052 THE MARKERS SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS TOLD OFF THE BITS OF EARS THEY HAD SAVED
6841-88291-0053 THE TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT AN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE
6841-88291-0054 FINALLY WOODEN DISCOVERED IT IN THIS HIP POCKET
6841-88291-0055 THEY HAD BEEN DOING IN A WRESTLER'S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNING BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED
6841-88291-0056 I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN'S AND THAT IT EXERCISED ONLY A CERTAIN MUSCLES OF THE BODY
6841-88294-0000 AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THE STORM ON THE ROOF CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND AND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EAVES
6841-88294-0001 WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKING OUT OF A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL
6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEEL THROUGH CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN MY LEFT LEGS
6841-88294-0003 THEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD CUT ME AND FOUND THAT THIS FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND
6841-88294-0004 IN PLACE OF IT I WORE A SHARP STEEL HOOK
6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHIN HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GITS HIT OVER THE HEAD AND DIDN'T SOUND GOOD
6841-88294-0006 IF A MAN BREATHES THAT WAY HE'S MOSTLY ALL GONE
6841-88294-0007 MEN GOT BATTED OVER THAT HEAD OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
6841-88294-0008 SOUR WINE IS FINE TO PUT A WOUND IN SHAPE THE HEEL BUT IT'S NO SOOTHING SYRUP
6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRAVE IT WAS THE SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEA DONE ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBARYE
6841-88294-0010 IT FAIR MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH THE BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE AND THE QUIET MOONLIGHT IN THE SHADOWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZONING EACH SIDE HIS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER THAT RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO GET HIM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AND PRETTY SOON A SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP
6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN HE'D SING THAT BARBARY SONG TILL I'D GO OUT AN LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWIN BY JIST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DIED AN GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE'D JUST TALK
6841-88294-0013 HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND HE GAVE HIS SIDE OF A CONVERSATIONS PAUSING FOR REPLIES
6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THE FIRE BUT I NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE'D COME FROM OR WHAT HE'D DONE
6841-88294-0015 I COULDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HE WAS QUIET
6841-88294-0016 USUALLY I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
6841-88294-0017 HE WAS LYING ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM WERE THE SAME DISTANCE
6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES HE ASKED VERY ATTENTIVE
6841-88294-0019 ONE A LITTLE SQUEEZE TALK ABOUT YOUR DEADLY WEAPONS
6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'D BEN TOO SICK AN TOO LONG ABED
6841-88294-0021 IN A MINUTE OR TWO HE CAME TO
6841-88294-0022 NOW YOU'RE A NICE SWEET COMPANION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
6841-88294-0023 THEY'RE SAFE ENOUGH LET ME HAVE THEM HE VENTURED
6841-88294-0024 NOW LOOK THERE SAID I YOU CAN'T GET UP TO DAY YOU AIN'T FIT
6841-88294-0025 I KNOW HE PLEADED BUT LEMME SEE EM
6841-88294-0026 JUST TO SATISFY HIM I PASSED OVER HIS OLD DUDES
6841-88294-0027 I'VE BEEN ROBBED WE CRIED
6841-88294-0028 WHERE'S MY COAT THEY ASKED
6841-88294-0029 YOU HAD NO COAT TILL I PICKED YOU UP I REPLIED
6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED AT ME MUCH SUSPICIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
6841-88294-0031 AFTER HE'D EATEN A FAIRE MEAL HE FELL ASLEEP
6841-88294-0032 WHEN I CAME BACK THAT EVENING THE BUNK IS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE
6841-88294-0033 I DIDN'T SEE HIM THEN FOR TWO DAYS
6841-88294-0034 THEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM QUITE A WAYS OUT
6841-88294-0035 GUESS HE'S SUSPICIOUS I STOLE AN OLD COAT OF HIS THINKS I AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT
6841-88294-0036 HOWEVER HE DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THAT FRAME OF MINDS
6841-88294-0037 I RAN UP PULLING IN MY GUN
6841-88294-0038 IT MEX WAS FLAT ON HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
6841-88294-0039 ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK LEANED MY ONE ARMED FRIEND
6841-88294-0040 ANYWAY I THRUST THE MUZZLE OF MY COLT INTO THE SAILOR'S FACE THAT'S THIS I ASKED
6841-88294-0041 I WEEN HIM ET MONTI OF ANTONIO CURVAZ SAID HE
6841-88294-0042 THE GLEAM DIED FROM ITS EYE THE SNARL LIFTED HIS LIPS
6841-88294-0043 IN ANY CASE HE FLEW POCO PRONTO LEAVES ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
6841-88294-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOSTLY DOING ODD JOBS I SAW HIM OFF AND IN
6841-88294-0045 HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THE TIME ALMIGHTY BUSY HOLDING ON MY CARD GAMES
6841-88294-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YOU'D BETTER STAY RIGHT THEN
6841-88294-0047 I WANT TO MAKE UP FOR YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE SAID HE
6841-88294-0048 WHAT KIND OF GOOD THING I ASKED TREASURE FOR HE
6841-88294-0049 WE LOOKED ALL RIGHT ENOUGH NEITHER DRUNK NOR LOCO
6841-88294-0050 SET IT DOWN SAID I OVER THERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE
6841-88294-0051 HE DID SO A FAR AWAY SAID
6841-88294-0052 AND IT'S A BIG THING SAID HANDY SOLOMON TO ME FOR THEY'S NOT ONLY GOLD BUT ULTRA JEWELS AND DI'MOND
6841-88294-0053 HE WILL MAKE US RICH AND A DOZEN LIKE US AND YOU CAN KISS THE BOOK ON THAT
6841-88294-0054 THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT WHY DO HE TELL ME
6841-88294-0055 WHY DON'T YOU HAVE YOUR TREASURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF DIVIDING IT
6841-88294-0056 WHY MATE HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAIN GRATIFY
6841-88294-0057 DIDN'T YOU SAVE MY LIFE AND NUSS ME TO TAKE CARE OF ME WHEN I WAS NOT KILLED
6841-88294-0058 LOOK HERE ANDERSON OR HANDY SOLOMON OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO CALL YOURSELF I REJOINED TO THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU LL HAVE TO TALK STRAIGHT
6841-88294-0059 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY GRATITUDE BUT THAT DON'T DO WITH ME
6841-88294-0060 THE DEVIL'S A PREACHER IF YOU AIN'T LOST YOUR PENNY FEATHERS SAID HE
6841-88294-0061 WELL IT'S THIS THEN I GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GET THERE AND SHE MUST BE DOWNED
6841-88294-0062 AND I'D GOT TO HAVE HELP WITH THE TREASURE IF IT'S LIKE THIS FELLOW SAID IT WAS
6841-88294-0063 IT'S MONEY I GOT TO HAVE AND IT'S MONEY I HAVEN'T GOT AND CAN'T GET UNLESS I LETS SOMEBODY IN AS PARDNOR
6841-88294-0064 WHY ME I ANSWERED WHY NOT HE RETORTED
6841-88294-0065 WE TALKED THE MATTER OVER AT LEAST
6841-88294-0066 I STOOD OUT FOR A LARGER TREE
6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS AS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT I HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY THEY COMPROMISED
6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THE TREASURER WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SCHEME DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
700-122866-0000 JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE INDEED
700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLES FOR EVERY DAY LIFE
700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARILLA DISAPPROVES OF US
700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE HANDSOME YET
700-122866-0004 I FIRST LAY AWAKE AND IMAGINED THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP HER OLD INTERESTS
700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THEIR PROGRAMME AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY
700-122866-0007 THE WINTER WAS SLIP BY
700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYE AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THE CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON WRITE A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT
700-122866-0009 I CAN SCARCELY REALISE THAT I' AM IN MY TEENS
700-122866-0010 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS WELL WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT
700-122866-0011 AND RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BEAUS SAID ANNE DISDAINFULLY
700-122866-0012 SHE'S NATURALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ANY ONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN A TAKE NOTICE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
700-122866-0013 I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLEN AS I POSSIBLY CAN THOUGH I THINK SHE'S PERFECT
700-122866-0014 IF I HAD ALICE TELL'S CROOKED NOSE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY I WOULDN'T BUT THERE
700-122866-0015 I'M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMPLEMENT ABOUT ITS LONG AGO
700-122866-0016 YOU DIANA LOOK THERE'S A RABBIT
700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING PRETTY DREAM
700-122866-0018 I KNEW IT LAST MONDAY EVENING
700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED TO THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR IN DEATH NOT DIVIDED
700-122866-0020 I READ IT TO MARILLA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF IN NONSENSE
700-122866-0021 IT IT'S A SAD SWEET STORY
700-122866-0022 CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORNET OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DUSKY FLASHING EYE
700-122866-0023 YOU KNOWD SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE
700-122866-0024 BUT THEY GREW IN BEAUTY SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE SIXTEEN
700-122866-0025 I ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN WERE PROPOSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED
700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FRIEND THE SAME AS HER
700-122866-0027 LET'S YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CLUB ALL YOUR OWN AND WRITE STORIES FOR PRACTICE
700-122866-0028 YOU OUGHT TO CULTURE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS STACY SAYS SO
700-122866-0029 ONLY WE WILL TAKE THE RIGHT WAY
700-122866-0030 THIS WAS HOW THE STORY CLUB CAME INTO EXERCISE
700-122866-0031 NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION SHOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MEMBER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK
700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO READ HER STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN SHE TALK IT OVER
700-122866-0033 MINE IS ROSAMONDE MONTMOREIRE ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
700-122866-0034 I'M SURE THAT MUST HAVE A WHOLESOME ASPECT
700-122866-0035 THE MORAL IS THE SAME THING MISTER ALLEN SAYS SO
700-122866-0036 I READ ONE OF MY STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLEN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MARVEL WAS EXCELLENT
700-122866-0037 SHE AND RUBY ALMOST ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC PARTS
700-122866-0038 MISS JOSEPHINE BARIE WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE
700-122866-0039 I'M SURE MISTER ALLAN WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE
700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I HEARD THAT YOU
700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE ALWAYS FELTS SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANYBODY EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE
700-122866-0042 SO I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
700-122867-0000 WITH VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT
700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND MARY'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL GLADNESS
700-122867-0002 I MIGHT SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT OR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW
700-122867-0003 BUT PERHAPS YOU'RE JUDGING HER TOO HASTILY MARILLA
700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YE'D TAKE HER PART MATTHEW BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU
700-122867-0005 DEMANDED MARILLA ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO THAT BED
700-122867-0006 ANNE COWERED DEEPER IN HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOREVER FROM MORTAL EYES NO
700-122867-0007 GET RIGHT UP THIS MINUTE AND THEN TELL ME
700-122867-0008 THIS MINUTE I SAY THERE THEN WHAT IS IT
700-122867-0009 ANNE HAD SLID TO A FLOOR IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE
700-122867-0010 YES IT'S GREEN MOANED JANE
700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS RED HAIRE
700-122867-0012 YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR EITHER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
700-122867-0013 NOW THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAY
700-122867-0014 DAN SHIRLEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO
700-122867-0015 YES I MEAN IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED ANNE
700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DADDO
700-122867-0017 AND MISSUS ALLEN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANY ONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNTIL WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT
700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T THEN AND I REALLY BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY
700-122867-0019 WHO'S THERE WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
700-122867-0020 OH I DIDN'T LET YOU IN THE HOUSE
700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH MOST BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE
700-122867-0022 OH MONSIEUR WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTISED TO DECEIVE
700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR WILL BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
700-122867-0024 WITH A DISMAL SIGHS SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSORS
700-122867-0025 BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT WITH A DREADFUL COLOR IS THERE
700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO REPEAT ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF IT WON'T INTERFERE
700-122867-0027 IT SEEMED SO A TRAGIC THING
700-122867-0028 ANNA WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UP STAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
700-122867-0029 YES I WILL KNOW
700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF IT BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURLING
700-122867-0031 I EXPECT SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN TO MY NOSE NEXT
700-122867-0032 ANN'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM JOHN THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOKED LIKE A SCARE SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I COULDN'T
700-122867-0034 AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T IT
700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS AND I SHALL NEVER WANT TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO KEEP GOOD
700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLEN AND MISS STACY AND FEEL UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU
700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON ACROSS MY HEAD WITH A BOW AT ONE SIDE
700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL THAT A SNOOD THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
700-122867-0040 HIS HEAD IS BETTER NOW
700-122867-0041 IT WAS TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON BUT
700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MAY BE ELAINE ANNE SAID DIANA
700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW THAT I COULDN'T KEEP IT STILL
700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A RED HEADED ECLAINE MOURNED ANNE
700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS A LIVELY MAIDEN
700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DANIEL EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LOVED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANN'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATIZED ALAIN
700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THIS PRESENT
700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING CAN BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING A LANE
700-122868-0009 THE BLACKSHELL HAVING BEEN PROCURED AND SPED IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HER HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
700-122868-0011 THEN YOU ARRANGES
700-122868-0012 IT'S STEADY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE'S DEAD
700-122868-0013 JANE ROSE TO THE OCCASION'
700-122868-0014 WE LEFT BEHIND AT THE LANDING
700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE SOME GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
700-122868-0016 THERE IS ONE CHANCE JUST WON
700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT HAVING A FLOWERY PRAYER
700-122868-0018 THE FLAT GLITTERED UNDER THE BRIDGE AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MID STREAM
700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NO DOUBT BUT THAT AUNT HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY YET SEEMING LIKE AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAID
700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHERE HAD THE OTHERS GONE
700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES IN HER
700-122868-0023 AND SHIRLEY I
700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID WE GET UP THERE HE EXCLAIMED
700-122868-0025 IT HAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
700-122868-0026 OR WHAT HAS HAPPENED ANNE
700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING UP HIS OARES
700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT AND THE BARGE I MEAN THE POT
700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT NON HESITATED
700-122868-0030 MY HEART GAVE A QUICK QUEER LITTLE BEAT
700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS WITH NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WANT TO GO
700-122868-0033 IT ALL RIGHT
700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN M SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL TO
700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS INTO SCRAPPE
700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO TAKE
700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANNE GROANED OLIVER
700-122868-0039 I DON'T SAY HOW SAID ROSA
700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME TO SOME GREAT SHORTCOMING
7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY IT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IPSOPHILICITAS SE NISCITEMPERAT PREMIT EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND TO CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT THE LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE IS SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER HAVE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THE SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATION
7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIVES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONERS WHETHER OF LESS OR GREATER WEIGHT
7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNATURAL PEOPLE AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUER'D BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAIN WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE
7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE ILLS OF A LONG PEACE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN A WAR
7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY THEIR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOT YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PAY
7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSE TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT THE PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE HONORS DELAYED BY THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
7601-101622-0005 LET BEAST'S BLOOD STAINS THE INFAMOUS ARENA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND TO DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY AGITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR DEATH
7601-101622-0007 THE VERY BOOKS THEMSELVES SET THEM ON
7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING OF REVOLT A
7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS GREAT ONBOARD THE FORWARD
7601-175351-0002 LIGHT THE FIRES EXCLAIMED AN
7601-175351-0003 WHAT WITH ASKED OTHER
7601-175351-0004 AND STUFF THE STOVE WITH THE MAST'S ADDED WARREN
7601-175351-0005 DID YOU HEAR HER
7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE OUT CRIED HATTERAS
7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PENN ADVANCING TOWARDS THE KITCHEN
7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED PENN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WOULDN'T GO ANY FURTHER
7601-175351-0009 YOU SHA'N'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEY SHAN'T LIGHT THE FIRE
7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN AND GUARDING
7601-175351-0011 A LITTLE MURMUR WAS HEARD
7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOVER AND WARREN WENT DOWN AT HIS POST
7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERING AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROW
7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BEHRING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWDING TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
7601-175351-0015 I'M BEGINNING NOT SO ANSWERED WALL
7601-175351-0016 HATTERAS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLELS AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT OF THESE ACCOUNTS AS APOCRYPHAL
7601-175351-0018 THAT NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO A CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK BRAVING THE COLD THE WIND OR THE SNOW
7601-175351-0021 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO IMITATE THEM I KNOW
7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE CROWDS MISTER CLAWBONNY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
7601-175351-0023 YOU WILL HOPE THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED THEN
7601-175351-0024 OH HE CERTAINLY WILL MISTER CLAWBONNY
7601-175351-0025 I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTS ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE TWO
7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRENELL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES
7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITANNIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHORING THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCIDDIDES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HINTS WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE A FAVOURITE THAT THIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE TRUE SOUNDS FOR THE HISTORIC PEN
7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS DESCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR THE FLIES
7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AND APOTHEGMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SPOLIA OPRIMA
7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATUS AND
7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE SHACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHERCOCKS THAT TURNED AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONG HEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION TO THE PEARL DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIVES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
7641-96252-0000 THUS WHEN DOGMAS HOLD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS STILL THE SAME
7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED THROUGH DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND QUESTION
7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN CAN DIE ON THE WHEEL AND ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH COULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS QUESTION
7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BELONGS TO A FLEETING AND ELUSIVE PHENOMENA
7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFER
7641-96252-0008 BUT THE LATTER IS THE NECESSARY AND FORMIDABLE SYMPTOM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITE OF THE STAIN OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE AND SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN A WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHICH HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND GENERALLY DO NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL ONE YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SERENITY OF DISPOSITION
7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON MEN
7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALIZE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTED GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO AUGHT FOR LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERRING THAT INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTWEIGH THE REGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULARLY WELL BEING
7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SOCRATES AND GIORDANO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTHS SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HANDS OF THE PRIESTS
7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES OR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK OF ITS SOURCE
7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPACITY FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON OCCASION
7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS AND
7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS STATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATES OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISH FOR DELIVERANCE
7641-96670-0000 THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS MORNING SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SESASTRIS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF AIA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN HER RISING AND SETTING
7641-96670-0002 MEDIA TOO HIS WISE DOCTOR KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF PHRETHEUS AND CROTHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMIS THEIR GRANDFATHER
7641-96670-0004 JASON TOOK PELIAS AND SELAMON WITH HIM
7641-96670-0005 AS HE CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHRIXUS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
7641-96670-0006 THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PALACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THIS MORNING
7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KENNAEUS LIVED WITH OBSCERTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDEA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS
7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDIA SAW A HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FASSIUS
7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THAT CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE
7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SARAMATTI
7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM WITH YOU
7641-96670-0013 ADA'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON IT AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
7641-96670-0014 AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIETER VOICE JASON SAID
7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER WITH THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF AN IMMORTALS
7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THIS GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU
7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE LOOKED AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY THEIR CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
7641-96670-0020 KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF EYRUS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS
7641-96670-0021 THEN SHE SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON
7641-96670-0022 AND IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE
7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO INTO MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
7641-96670-0024 THAN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS DEATH AS IT IS
7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDEAH GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
7641-96670-0027 PHRONTIS AND MELLIUS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
7641-96684-0000 AND AS A RESULT APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT FACE
7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEEN
7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER ADMETUS HAVING THE LOVES OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT SEEMED AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
7641-96684-0005 SO APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE OH APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMETUS OH
7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT DREAM
7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE WHEN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLACK SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS AND MEDINUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
7641-96684-0011 IF SOME WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO TREES
7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AS WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR
7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND DO WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE OLD WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
7641-96684-0016 ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S FACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
7641-96684-0017 THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH A DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0018 HE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KEEN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
7641-96684-0019 NOW A FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP
7641-96684-0020 THIS WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
7641-96684-0021 BUT THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOONER BE HERE FOR HER
7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR YE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE VALLEY
7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HIM FROM THE PALACE
7641-96684-0025 NO MORE SPEECH CAME WITH HER
7641-96684-0026 AND AS TO ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
7641-96684-0027 OF WHAT GOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DUE
7641-96684-0028 AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABORER WAS BEFORE HIM
7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED HIM FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH IT
7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THEME IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAMOUS WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
7641-96684-0032 HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS THEN HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD FOR ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE CALLED PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT PERCEIVE HER FEATURES
7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM A ENEMY
7641-96684-0037 THIS I MAY NOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PAINS ENOUGH
7641-96684-0038 THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLDS OF HIS HOUSE
7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOORWAY OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN O THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIANE SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION
7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN AND STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR HIS MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THESE MEAN
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEAR IT
7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN THOUGHT MEANS THIS
7697-105815-0008 THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COME IN TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAID IT LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAUS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TEMPLE WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRAVE ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACED FROM THY SINS
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CHRIST' BLESSED TOMB
7697-105815-0012 HE WALKED ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU
7697-105815-0014 FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZIIN FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 KNOW YO'RE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED TO CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE'RE GETTING A ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ARTS
7697-105815-0019 IS NOT EVERY CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT IN TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN RAN UP THE HILL
7697-105815-0022 AND HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMAS SAID THAT TSAYING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR US LIMBS
7697-105815-0025 THEN HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 HE FELT TO IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS SOUL
7697-105815-0028 OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHIRE HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE FEELING
7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN ON OUR WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BANK HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT ON HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAS GOT BACK HIS SCROBE
7697-105815-0033 HE LAID IT UP INTO THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAMB THE TABLE
7697-105815-0035 HE THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRINGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IT IS MY STRENGTH SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE BROUGHT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HAVE NONE
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE A WATCHFALL DWELT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT ELSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE HE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITHIN TO THE HOUSES
7697-105815-0043 HAIGH COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 A CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT THIEN
7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I CAN DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD
7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN HERE I HAVE
7697-105815-0048 CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NEVER BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NO HAVE ME LEAVE THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN THE LARGE ROOMS THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JAW BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAIN AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIANIA
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANUZ LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YE MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THIS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO IS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH THE CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HELPFULS SAID CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH A FIELDS
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU THE HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HATH BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBTS IT IS FOR OUR GOOD
7697-105817-0008 CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOW NOT STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SAID DRY IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH WE LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FOR TOD
7697-105817-0011 AND BY THIS ACT WE KILLE OUR SOULS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER THEM
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE ONE HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE HE HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DISBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWEVER GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPREME
7697-245712-0004 THIRDLY THIS WAS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MEN AND OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS A PART IS PAID IT IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOM PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET THEIR ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HA A BIT MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THIS SAFE INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE A MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATE THEN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEANMENT OVER PLANS
7697-245712-0013 NOW IN MEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MATTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON A DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNI HAVE BEEN STERILE
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARABILITY
7697-245712-0016 INEQUALITIES MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER A MAN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUCH A MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF OBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A CHANGE OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF HER AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY HER GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZES AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS ON GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MASTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AS I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED MADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS OF THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 AND EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENCE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN MAY FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE HE COULD SAY ANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE
8173-294714-0008 YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IT IS ALL YOURS
8173-294714-0009 WHAT WRONG ARE YOU TALKING OF YOU
8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I OFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL
8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREATER MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS YOUR CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD AND PRIDE SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MINES
8173-294714-0016 A SELFISH WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY ME FOR MY FOOD AND SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE WIFE OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED THERE
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLY THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO WILL DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM KILLING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 YOU WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN WE HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF IT
8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED AND SPOKE OF IT NO
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE GIRL WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM AND FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SEE
8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN TOO
8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOME THING TO BE YOUR ONLY FRIEND
8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRACEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH
8173-294714-0033 MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES IN LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT D YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRANDT AND
8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF MY DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY NEED YOU TO HESITATE
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO REVEAL YOUR ANXIETIES
8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLEASANT TRUTH
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HER GETTING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS THAT HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF ITS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR THEM WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT A GREAT INTEREST IN HER DEATH

8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY ON THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
8254-115543-0001 EVERY THING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF ORDERS
8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING OR SCOLDING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON
8254-115543-0003 THERE WAS QUITE A PROGRESSION WHEN AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY
8254-115543-0004 BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER AND HER DOLLY DECK A SORT OF A LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SEWN BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES
8254-115543-0005 BESIDES THE FAMILY THERE WERE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THE LOW MOVING WAGON
8254-115543-0006 THE COOK TWO WENT WITH THEM
8254-115543-0007 GOODBYE SHOUTED LITTLE KNOLL FROM HIS GARDEN WHILE THEY WENT BY GOOD BY
8254-115543-0008 THEY SHOUTED GREETINGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE POTTER AS THEY PASSED HIM AND ALSO TO THE OLD FAKIR SMEARED ALL OVER WITH ASHES WHO SAT IN A LITTLE BRICK HUT BY THE BRIDGE AND PRETENDED TO HAVE WONDERFUL CURES
8254-115543-0009 THIS IS MORE FUN THAN GOING TO SCHOOL SAID ICOLA AS THE OXEN PLODDED ALONG THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
8254-115543-0010 THESE LOVELY WOODS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS RUN QUITE WILD
8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF HIS ROSARY OF BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS
8254-115543-0012 AS THE WAGON CAME UP A YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THE HOLY MAN WENT UP AND HELD OUT A BEGGING BOWL SAYING GIVE O CHARITABLE PEOPLE TO THIS HOLY ONE
8254-115543-0013 NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MANY REGULARS AS INDIA
8254-115543-0014 MOST OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM
8254-115543-0015 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO EXPLORE THE ISLAND NEAR THEM
8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THEY ARE DOGS SAID MAHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOG WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CANE DOWN BY A STREAM
8254-115543-0017 PERHAPS YOU CAN BUY SOME FROM THE MAN THERE HE IS NOW PLOWING BY THE STREAM SAID COLLA
8254-115543-0018 IT IS LOOKING FOR WATER SAID THE FARMER AS HE TOOK A LAST STOCK OF CALE AND GENTLY GUIDED IT DOWN TO THE STREAM
8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS ANOTHER SACRED ANIMAL OF THE HINDOOS BUT THEY WOULD NOT KILL OR INJURE ONE FOR ANYTHING
8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST IN THE ROAD
8254-115543-0021 IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING IN STATE ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJA OR RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MODERN INDIA WAS FORMERLY MAKE UP
8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT ALL DECORATED WITH OAK AND GOLD AND SILVER
8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS THE HOWDAH WHICH WAS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND ON THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS THE RAJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLOURED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN
8254-115543-0024 BEHIND THE HOWDAH STOOD A SOLDIER HOLDING A BIG UMBRELLA OF FINE FEATHERS OVER THE RAJAH'S HEAD
8254-115543-0025 THE DRIVER SAT ON THE NECK OF THE ELEPHANT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST BY PRODDING HIM ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN IRON SHOD STICK OR TOAD
8254-115543-0026 ISN'T IT FINE TO RIDE LIKE THAT ON A DEAD ELEPHANT
8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF THE DAY THE OLD FOLK TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE GREAT RAJA AND HIS ESCORT
8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONGST MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS OR BARGAINING FOR FOOD AT THE LITTLE BOOTH
8254-115543-0029 OF THESE THEY USED FOR PLATES HEAPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICE AND CURRY AND FISH AND ALL SORTS OF PUDDINGS AND SWEETS
8254-115543-0030 A SUPPER WAS BEING EATEN ANOTHER PARTY STOPPED AT THE PARR OR ENCAMPED NOT FAR AWAY
8254-115543-0031 WHEN THE LITTER WAS PUT DOWN A YOUNG BOY STEPPED OUT LOOKED VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY
8254-115543-0032 HIS SERVANTS AT ONCE SPREAD A HANDSOME RUG ON THE GROUND FOR HIM TO SIT ON AND ROLLED ABOUT WAITING ON HIM TAKING GOOD CARE TO KEEP EVERY ONE AT A DISTANCE
8254-115543-0033 YES AND WHEN HE ORDERS EVERY ONE ABOUT HIM
8254-115543-0034 ROUND THE LITTLE BRAHMIN'S NECK WAS A THIN CORD OR THREAD WHICH IS A SIGN OF HIS HIGH CASTE
8254-115543-0035 MEANWHILE THE HAUGHTY LITTLE BRAHMIN ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HIS HEAD TURNED AWAY SO NO ONE COULD SEE HIM EAT AND THEN GROWING TIRED OF RESPECTFUL GLANCES TO THE CROWD AROUND HIM HE GOT INTO HIS LITTER AGAIN AND THE SERVANTS FASTENED THE CURTAINS TIGHTLY AROUND HIM
8254-115543-0036 EVERYBODY SLEPT SOUNDLY IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE SERVANTS WAS BEATING A DRUM MOST OF THE NIGHT WHICH THEY REALLY BELIEVED WAS HIS WAY TO KEEP OFF EVIL SPIRITS
8254-115543-0037 OH THE THIEVES I CRIED
