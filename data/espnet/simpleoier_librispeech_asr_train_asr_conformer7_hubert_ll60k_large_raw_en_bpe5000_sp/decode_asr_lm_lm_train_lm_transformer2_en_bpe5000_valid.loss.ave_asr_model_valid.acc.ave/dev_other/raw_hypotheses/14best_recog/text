116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THAT CITY I HEARD THE BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW THE GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND I PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZE FOR A MOMENT SLIGHTLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE NOW I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GUIDE
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CONDUCT THE WORSHIP AND AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AN IDOL I WHISPERED TAKING BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 WE WORSHIPPED GODS THAT DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THE GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAMOUR IN MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NEVER I SAID IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS THE IDOL THEN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 IT MADE ATHENS A CITY OF NIGHT IT CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 YOU HAD ONLY ONE FAULT INTERRUPTED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 HE INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANSWER WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 PRODUCING SOME
116-288045-0015 I WAS WHISPERED TO MYSELF WHAT BLASPHEMY
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES IN HOMER CONCERNING THE DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT ONCER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOME OF THE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLLO IS NOW AN IDOL
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AND THE SON OF HIS GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE THE VARIOUS LIGHTS OF IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MIEN OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT THE PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTHDAY OF OUR BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH A SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS FACE
116-288045-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON WHO WAS ONLY AN IDOL
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH FOR THE APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWERING TO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JOSEPH I HASTEN TURNING TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 MAY HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL YOU NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO COMMAND HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I EXCLAIMED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF THE IDOL AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JOSEPH IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CANDIED DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN A MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY GIVE FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF BELIEF
116-288046-0003 IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE WAS NOT BUILT UP IS ANOTHER CRITICISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OR THE PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTH IN A JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF THE STUDENT IT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BINNEL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RITES PHYSICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WISH WE'D TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 AND FIRST LET US BE IMPERSONAL THE EPITHETS IRREVERENT BLASPHEMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG AT A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM ENVY
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE AWAITING THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEI HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST ANIMATED BY THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BY CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 A MYTH IS A FANCILESS EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MIND CRAVES FOR KNOWLEDGE THIS CHILD ASKS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN INBORN DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY GOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS MYTHOS THE PRIMITIVE MAN WAS SATISFIED UNTIL HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED ITS INADEQUACY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALIZATION
116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN INDIAN HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE HINDUS
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MY SISTERS HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JESUS A MYST
116-288047-0007 THERE IS IN THAT A FACULTY FOR FICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS THEN IT GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BIT INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURBING ITS PACES AND SUBDUING ITS RELENTLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FILL THE SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS THE FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE AND AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 WE COVET THE PIANO WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET DO NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED A YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN SINCE MAN HAD MATURED
116-288047-0014 A GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FISH OF MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THIS SCHOOL IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF SCIENCES
116-288047-0017 RELIGION THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILD
116-288047-0018 AND THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTHPIECE AND ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TO BE REASONABLY
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE PARENTS
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOURING HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR A REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DATES WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES AS THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPELS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAINLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 THEN THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 WHY IS DISCREPANCY IN THE HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HARROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS ABOUT JOSEPH WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 ALTHOUGH IT IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON FLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN AND THE ZODIAC AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN AUSTRALIA HAS BECOME THE CONSTANT EASTER
116-288048-0008 BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE OUREGEN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SCEPTICAL CELSUS ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISTS OF GENIUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANION OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYSTICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO IS MATTHEW WHO IS MARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE TOM PETER JUDAS AND MARY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT IT EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF JESUS EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AND AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MYTH
116-288048-0016 AND HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPYING THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS THE HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD I HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 HOW ELSE IS THIS UNANIMOUS SENSATION TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THOSE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONOURS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BY THE SWORD NOW OR BY HELL FIRE HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 IF THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JUDAS MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO PORTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISES THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS BEING ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF DELUDED PROFITS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE REDUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH UNPLEASANT PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH THE PREACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARRIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT HE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAYS IF YE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID YOU NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER WAS A REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE SACRIFICE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR METEOR OF MANIFESTATION IS LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THAT WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND OF DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG AFTER HER FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THUS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPES WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SUCH WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONE
1255-138279-0008 TWO THREE THREE
1255-138279-0009 FOUR FIFTY
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED AROUND HALF A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALL
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE WATER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDLAND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITY OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW WAS CROSSED AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THAT A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 TO THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I ASKED HIM WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 OH I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 OH MUST I THAT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 AND HAVE MONEY
1255-138279-0021 AN WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I WAS
1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I HAD FORGOT TO ASK
1255-138279-0024 GOOD NIGHT FRANK GOOD
1255-74899-0000 THAT THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THAT COUNTESS NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH I RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND I SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BEGGED FOR NO DELAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MANNER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS CHEAP AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WERE PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LOVELL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM ALTOGETHER
1255-74899-0009 THEY'RE HOLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAD TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY WAS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
1255-74899-0012 WHILE YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MASTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS THAT TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER THWAITES SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FROM THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES WOULD BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO SHE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN LASTS ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WORK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I'LL SOONER SEE YOU DARNED MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEETHEART
1255-74899-0021 I MAY DO THAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AND NOW I'D SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 AND HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK AGAIN
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE SAID
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH AND YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD SAY SO
1255-90407-0006 HE'S MY MOTHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT YOU HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER'S IT A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 BUT WE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'VE HEARD IT
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME OF HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY SISTER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 BUT THAT THIS EVENING
1255-90407-0014 BUT THERE ON THE NETS THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULET
1255-90407-0016 NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH NOW IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LARGE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE LAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCES OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND HE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT THIS ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PALACE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WERE SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL MY SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING IN THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE HAD CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPY MY LORD SAID PEARSON
1255-90407-0028 HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANCE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MAKING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE ABBESS CARROW
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES HIM
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINEAVAN'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF THE OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THEIR EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WERE NOT ALL
1255-90413-0004 BUT WAS HE REAL
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAVE NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE DECIDED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND WE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELLOW SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD LAIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GRAYISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKED IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES AH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVILE THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS MORE UNCIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A COMPLIMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANELCLIFFE'S THE OTHER NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSCELYN PIERTIN
1255-90413-0019 HOW DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINEAVIN WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY BISHOP'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY ARRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICOLA PINE HAVING
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD MADE THE FIRST ARRIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF OF THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER CROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE THING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE IN APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORK MEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF MY INVENTOR IS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRUSTFUL COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOUR OFTEN WAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGES OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVEALED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD YET SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSOLVETICISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN RANKENING FAST
1585-131718-0007 YES THE VERY ROGUAL OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENT ARCLIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR STREET LINING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRING FOUND WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THERE INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES THE LEADING CITIES
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITIONS TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WERE SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCLADE BUT HE INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
1585-131718-0016 HERE THEN IS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF THEATRES THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PRODUCE ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
1585-131718-0018 THAT MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OBSERVATION OF WHICH THERE WAS PLENTY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED IN ACTIVE ILL WILL
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE EUGENIA INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM AND THE BALLASTO WATGAGE
1585-131718-0023 SHE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROGRESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING ON FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLUE HOW TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORKS NICELY
1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO ADDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING THE CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HAM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOWORTH STREETS NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE PARADES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WORCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND VARIOUS OTHER DETAILS
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLY LIGHT COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS THE PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THAT FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE
1585-131718-0033 THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE LITTLE GAS ENGINE IS RATHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A RANCH
1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY SEVEN WAS A VERITABLE BEE HIVE DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARDNACLET OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMEN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGRORS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE EM WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT
1585-131718-0040 I HAVE THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT YOU
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO HAVE NOTICE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMONET
1585-131718-0044 HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASK HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN
1585-131718-0045 ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL ON SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLIN
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIREBURY GATE
1585-131718-0048 HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE INDIANS AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLERS DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LINE FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS HERWING FIRST
1585-131718-0051 I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE CLOAK
1585-131718-0052 THEN THEY GOT PLEURACION AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF FACTENING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRE
1585-157660-0000 LONDON AS GOLD AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MEN ARE MODED OUT OF THOUGHT AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE OLD STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAMS STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UTTERED THE FOLLOWING ORRITORICAL FLY
1585-157660-0003 GLORIOUS GLORIOUS LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WONDERFUL ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHILE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEATEN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT OF ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNING COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERING AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE FOLDING ARMS OF MORPHUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THIS SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXPECTATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPORTATION'S FOULTS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST HE PROMISES AND OFT HE HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLITS
1585-157660-0009 DUSIS ONE DABL WHEN SIX IS TREBACOY
1585-157660-0010 WILLAM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CENOPOT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION
1585-157660-0011 THAT POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE A WORD FOR IT
1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SENT MY LIFE UPON A CASTE AND WILL WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BREW PAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD DROPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCS
1585-157660-0015 THE PREEN'S SHOP OF OUR WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVEN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES BURRIBRIDGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS PROUD MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BEEN FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THIS SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THEIR SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAD GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE VAST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO SOME COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MODEST RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THERE ACQUIRED A TRUE LOVE OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT EPOCH OF THE SOUL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHABADA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERWHELMING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS STIRRED INTO OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT CONCENTRATION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ODOR WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY THE INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THESE ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 BY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS INTO THE GRIP OF AN INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE AND GROWTH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING CELLS INTO A PROMINENT PASSIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOLDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEIR OWN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MASTERING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING OUR STEPS OF AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF TAKING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND OF FIGHTING IN FREEDOM'S CAUSE
1630-102884-0016 IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE TASK OF INERTIA WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUTH AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY BOTH WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND OUTSIDE
1630-141772-0000 ON THE PRADSEN HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAGSTAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND CHILDLIKE MOAN
1630-141772-0001 SUDDENLY HE AGAIN FELT THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BURNING LACERATING PAIN OF HIS HEAD
1630-141772-0002 WAS THIS FIRST THOUGHT
1630-141772-0003 HE FEEBLY MOVED HIS LEG AND UTTERED A WEAKLY GROAN WHICH AROUSED HIS OWN PITY
1630-141772-0004 LIFT THIS YOUNG MAN OUT AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TERRIBLE PAIN OF BEING LIFTED ON TO THE STRETCHER THE JOLTING WHILE BEING MOVING AND THE PROBING OF HIS WOUNDS AT THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0006 DURING THEIR TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPEAK
1630-141772-0007 HE SAID ON SEEING THE PRISONERS
1630-141772-0008 I COMMANDING AS SQUADRON REPLIED REPNIN
1630-141772-0009 PRINCE REPNINE NAMED LIEUTENANT SUCTELLIN
1630-141772-0010 AFTER THE LOOKING AT HIM NAPOLEON SMILED
1630-141772-0011 YOUTH IS NO HINDRANCE TO COURAGE MUTTERED SUCTAIN IN A FAILING VOICE
1630-141772-0012 A STUPID REPLY SAID NAPOLEON
1630-141772-0013 PRINCE HENRY WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYES TO COMPLETE THE SHOW OF PRISONERS COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHONE WITH SELF SATISFACTION AND WONDER
1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD ICORN PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOR THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY NOW HASTENED TO REPAIR THE HOLY IMAGE
1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED BUT THE LITTLE IKON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED ON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GREAT IT UD BE TO KNOW WHERE TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THE GRAVE
1630-141772-0018 HOW HAPPY AND CALM I SHALL BE IF I COULD NOW SAY LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME
1630-141772-0019 EITHER TO A POWER INDEFINABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHICH I NOT ONLY CANNOT ADDRESS BUT WHICH I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS IN WORDS THE GREAT ALL IS NOTHING SAID HE TO HIMSELF OR TO THAT GOD WHO HAS BEEN SOWN INTO THIS AMULET BY MARY
1630-141772-0020 THE STRETCHERS MOVED UPON
1630-141772-0021 THE QUIET HOME LIFE AND PEACEFUL HAPPINESS OF BUL HILLS PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM
1630-141772-0022 HE IS A NERVOUS BILIOUS OBJECT SAID LARRY AND WILL NOT RECOVER
1630-73710-0000 IT IS AT THE FOOT OF WOMEN THAT WE LAY THE LAURELS THAT WITHOUT HER SMILE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GAINED IT IS HER IMAGE THAT STRINGS THE LYRE OF THE POET THAT ANIMATES OUR VOICE IN THE BLAZE OF ELOQUENT FACTION AND GUIDES HER BRAIN IN THE AUGUST TOILS OF STATELY COUNSELS
1630-73710-0001 IS THERE NO HOPE FOR THEM SO FULL OF HELP
1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE BUT NOT TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO THE IMAGINATION
1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCUR FLITS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OBSCURING ALL OUR GAY FANCIES WITH ITS BAT LIKE WING AND TAINTING THE HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF A HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPIRATIONS
1630-73710-0004 MINE KNOW
1630-73710-0005 WHERE DEAD WHAT COULD YE DO
1630-73710-0006 I BET ABOUT MY CHAMBER LIKE A FISHY BIRD IN A CAGE
1630-73710-0007 DO NOT THINK OF MOVING TO ME
1630-73710-0008 DO NOT TAKE THE MESSENGER AN INSTANT
1630-73710-0009 SEE ON MY PONY
1630-73710-0010 WRITE ONLY ONE WORD INTO YOUR OWN HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0011 FLOUDNANT TO HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0012 GOD BLESS YOU MY HENRIETTA MY BELOVED BELOVED MY MATCHLESS HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0013 WHY HAS THAT SEPARATION NOT COST ME
1630-73710-0014 PANGS BUT I COULD NOT CONCEIVE ANY HUMAN MISERY COULD OCCASION
1630-73710-0015 AND REALLY I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT HE WAS UNINJURED LAST NIGHT
1630-73710-0016 I DARE NOT NOW OWN HOW FOOLISH I WERE
1630-73710-0017 DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOURSELF HENRIETTA BUT I'M NERVOUS ABOUT CONCEALING OUR ENGAGEMENT FROM PAPA
1630-73710-0018 DAYS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE YOU CAN REACH BATH AND I KNOW FERDINAND I KNOW YOUR ADVICE IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WILL CONFESS
1630-73710-0019 BUT COME BACK MY OWN AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND WRITE TO ME AT THE POST OFFICE AS YE'RE SETTLED
1630-73710-0020 THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THEY ARE SO NEAR MAKES ME RESTLESS
1630-73710-0021 I WISH TO MEET HIM WITH AS MUCH COOLNESS AS I CAN COMMAND
1630-96099-0000 THAT TOO SIR WE WILL OF COURSE UNDERTAKE
1630-96099-0001 NOW SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HE HAS SOME SPECIAL INFORMATION SOME GREAT NEWS
1630-96099-0002 WHEN BLOCH APPEARED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH THEM
1630-96099-0003 GOT NOW JUST WHEN WE MOST WARNED HIM NEVER
1630-96099-0004 ETIATE TRIPLE ITIATE
1630-96099-0005 YOU SHALL BE DISMISSED DISCHARGED FROM THE CZAR YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE CAUSE
1630-96099-0006 IT IS THAT ONLY YOUR GREAT GLUTTONY
1630-96099-0007 MY GENTLEMAN MAKES HIMSELF MOST PLEASANT
1630-96099-0008 WELL AT ANY RATE TO MY SINS I ACCEPTED
1630-96099-0009 WE ENTERED THE FIRST RESTAURANT THAT OF THE REUNITED TRENTS YOU KNOW IT PERHAPS MISTER
1630-96099-0010 I HAD NO FEAR OF HIM NOT TILL THE VERY LAST WHEN HE PLAYED ME SOME EVIL TURN
1630-96099-0011 I SUSPECTED NOTHING WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT HIS POCKET BOOK IT WAS STUFFED FULL MONSIEUR I SAW THAT AND MY CONFERENCE INCREASED CALLED FOR THE RECKONING AND PAID WITH AN ITALIAN BANK NOTE IT
1630-96099-0012 EXCUSE ME ONE MINUTES PRAY
1630-96099-0013 HE WENT OUT MESSIER AND PIFF PAL HE WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN
1630-96099-0014 WHY GET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
1630-96099-0015 IT WAS ONLY NOW AT THE LANTH HOUR THAT THE ITALIAN HAD BECOME INCULPATED AND THE QUESTION OF HIS POSSIBLE ANXIETY TO ESCAPE HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED
1630-96099-0016 WHO LEFT EVERYTHING BEHIND
1630-96099-0017 HAND IT TO HIM SAID THE CHIEF AND WHEN IT CAME INTO HIS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES HURRIEDLY
1630-96099-0018 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND NOT MORE THAN A WORDS HERE AND THERE
1630-96099-0019 IT IS NO DOUBT ENTIRELY
1630-96099-0020 OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WOULD NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT OF THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OR OF MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE
1630-96099-0021 IT WAS A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED LIERRE A HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS HA
1630-96099-0022 HE IS MUCH PRESSED IN A GREAT HURRY
1630-96099-0023 DIRECTLY HE REACHED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED THE DEVIL
1630-96099-0024 HE WISHED TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT WHEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CAB AND WERE DRIVEN AWAY TOGETHER
1650-157641-0000 THAT SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARD SMOKING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER WAS CURIOUS
1650-157641-0001 NOW MISSUS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IT IN A SMOKING HUMOUR AND SHALL PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHT
1650-157641-0002 BUT SEE THAT WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU
1650-157641-0003 THE DWARF'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE DELICATE
1650-157641-0004 BUT CROLP AND BRASS WERE NOW IN SOCIETY
1650-157641-0005 THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE OPONICS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO
1650-157641-0006 ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THE GOOD DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATES SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR SMOKING AMONG OFFICERS OF THE ARMY
1650-157641-0007 THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ODOUR OF TOBACCO AND THE DISTRESSED THE MAN WHO SMOKED
1650-157641-0008 HERE IS FIST TOODO'S OR THACKERAY'S COMMENT ON IT WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
1650-157641-0009 I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT THE WOMAN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RIVAL
1650-157641-0010 I WOULD LAY A GUINEA BUT A MAN LADY WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I AM A SMOKER AND SAYS OH THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE
1650-157641-0011 GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR THREESCORE YEARS FRANCE MOVES TO A MAN
1650-157641-0012 PSAH LOOKED AT HIS PROGRESS
1650-157641-0013 THIS THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS NOW BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
1650-157641-0014 THE JOURNALISTS AND THE BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THE COGERS WERE ABOUT WERE BELOW THE BIG TASTES OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS
1650-157641-0015 BOTH QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE PRINCE CANSLOR DETESTED IT SO TOBACCO WAS TABOO WHEREVER THE COURT WAS
1650-167613-0000 THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT THE PRINCE ANDREW APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS SON ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA
1650-167613-0001 SEAS WERE BROUGHT IN AND SOW WAS THIRTY
1650-167613-0002 THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT THE PEER'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF THE MOUSICOTE AND THE POSITION OF OUR ARMY AMONG WHICH HE HAD RIDDEN
1650-167613-0003 FOR YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS
1650-167613-0004 NOW BEING A MILITARY MAN IT CAN'T SAY I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL POSITION
1650-167613-0005 WELL THEN YE KNOW MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE BE IT WHO IT MAY SAID PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0006 AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BARCLAY DE TOLLEY
1650-167613-0007 PURE LOOKED AT MALCOLM WITH A CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH EVERYBODY IN VOLUNTARILY ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER
1650-167613-0008 WE SEE LIGHT AGAIN SINCE HIS SERENITY HAS BEEN APPOINTED YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID MOCKING TIMIDLY AND CONTINUALLY TURNING TO GLANCE AT THE COLONEL
1650-167613-0009 WHY SO ASK THIS PEER
1650-167613-0010 AS WHY WAS IT FORBIDDEN
1650-167613-0011 AT SMOLENSK TOO HE JUDGED CORRECTLY THAT THE FRENCH MUST OUTFLANK US AS THEY HAD LARGE FORCES
1650-167613-0012 HE ORDERED US TO RETREAT AND ALL OUR EFFORTS AND ALLOWANTS WENT FOR NOTHING
1650-167613-0013 SOWY THE ASPEN WITH BARKELEY
1650-167613-0014 WELL RUSSIA WAS WELL A FOREIGNER COULD SERVE HER AND BE A SPLENDID MINISTER BUT AS SOON AS SHE IS IN DANGER SHE NEEDS ONE OF HER OWN KING
1650-167613-0015 AND THEY SAY HE IS THE SKILFUL COMMANDER REJOINED PEER
1650-167613-0016 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MEANT BY A SKILLFUL COMMANDER SAID PRINCE ANDREW IRONICALLY
1650-167613-0017 HIS SKILFUL COMMANDER REPLIED THE PEER
1650-167613-0018 PURE LOOK AT THE HIM IN SURPRISE
1650-167613-0019 AND YET THEY SAID THAT THE WAR IS LIKE A GAME OF CHESS HE REMARKED
1650-167613-0020 THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF PIECES OF TROOP CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO ANY ONE
1650-167613-0021 SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT WERE EVEN ON MEMBERS AND THE LEAST OF ALL ON POSITION BUT ON WHAT THEN
1650-167613-0022 AND THE FEELING THAT IS IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMALKIN AND HE IS SOWER
1650-167613-0023 THE BATTLE IS WON BY THOSE WHO THOROUGHLY RESOLVE TO WIN IT
1650-167613-0024 WHY DID WE LOSE THE BATTLE AT THE OUSBULTERS
1650-167613-0025 YOU'VE LOUSED SO LET US RUN AND WE RUN
1650-167613-0026 BUT TO MORROW WE SHAN'T SAY THAT
1650-167613-0027 BUT IS WHAT A WEIGHT HAS TO MORROW
1650-167613-0028 THE FACT IS THAT THOSE MEN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE RIDDEN ROUND THE POSITION NOT ONLY TO NOT HELP MATTERS BUT TO HINDER
1650-167613-0029 THAT'S THE TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH SAID MARKIN
1650-167613-0030 'S NOW THE DAY FOR THAT THEY SAY

1650-167613-0033 THE FRENCH HAS DESTROYED MY HOME AND OUR ONLY WAY TO DESTROY MARSICO THEY HAVE OUTRAGED AND ARE OUTRAGING ME EVERY MOMENT THESE ARE MY ENEMIES
1650-167613-0034 IN MY OPINION THESE ARE ALL CRIMINALS
1650-167613-0035 AND SO THINKS TIMALKI AND THE WHOLE ARMY
1650-167613-0036 SINCE THEY ARE MY FOES THEY CANNOT BE MY FRIENDS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SAID AT ATUSIT
1650-167613-0037 YES YES MUTTERED PIERRE LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES AT THE PRINCE
1650-167613-0038 THEY TALK TO US OF RULES OF WAR OF CHIVALRY OR FLAGS OF TRUTH OF MERCY TO THE UNFORTUNATE AND SO ON IT IS OUR RUBBISH
1650-167613-0039 THE PLUNDER OF OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES ISHUFUSS PAPER MONEY AND WORST OF ALL THEY KILL MY CHILDREN AND MY FATHER AND THEN TALK OF RULES OF WAR AND MAGNANIMITY TO FOES
1650-167613-0040 TAKE NO PRISONERS BUT A KEEL AND BE KILLED
1650-167613-0041 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD FELT IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER OR NOT MASSACO WAS TAKEN AS MALINESK HAD BEEN WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED IN HIS SPEECH BY AN UNEXPECTED CRAMMY HIS THROAT
1650-167613-0042 HE PACED UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES IN SILENCE BUT HIS EYES GLITTERED FEVERISHLY AND HIS LIPS QUIVERING AS HE BEGAN SPEAKING
1650-167613-0043 AND WHEN THERE WAS A WAR LIKE THIS ONE IT UD BE WAR
1650-167613-0044 WHAT IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESS IN A WARFARE

1650-167613-0052 NO HE DOES NOT WANT IT PIERRE RETORTED
1650-167613-0053 AND THEN I KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING
1650-167613-0054 ONE PICTURE SUCCEEDED ANOTHER AND HIS IMAGINATION
1650-167613-0055 UNDER ONE OF THEM HE DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY
1650-173551-0000 HIS MAJOR DOMO CAME IN A SECOND TIME TO SAY THAT THE FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT A LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND THAT SOME ONE FROM BEZZETEV'S WIDOW HAD A COW TO ASK PIERRE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOK AS SHE HERSELF WAS LEAVING FOR THE COUNTRY
1650-173551-0001 THERE WAS NO ONE ON THE PASSAGE
1650-173551-0002 THE HALP PORTER WAS STANDING AT THE FRONT DOOR
1650-173551-0003 FROM THE LANDING WHERE YOU STOOD THERE WAS A SECOND STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE BACK ENTRANCE
1650-173551-0004 HE WENT DOWN THAT STAIRS AND OUT INTO THE YARD NO ONE HAD SEEN HIM
1650-173551-0005 WHEN HE FELT THAT HE WAS BEING LOOKED AT HE BEHAVED LIKE A OSTERBRIDGE WHICH HIDE HIS HEAD IN A BUSH IN ORDER NOW TO BE SEEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND QUICKENING HIS PACE WENT DOWN THE STREET
1650-173551-0006 HE HIRED THE FIRST A CAB HE MET AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE PATRIAX'S POUNCE WHERE THE WIDOW BARSITIVE'S HOUSE WAS
1650-173551-0007 THIS WAS THE AUTHENTIC SCOTCH ACTS WITH PATH'S NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS
1650-173551-0008 HE SAT DOWN AT THIS DUSTY WRITING TABLE AND HAVING LAID THE MANUSCRIPT BEFORE HIM OPENED THEM OUT CLOSED THEM FINALLY PUSHED THEM AWAY AND RESTING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND SANK INTO MEDICATION
1650-173551-0009 MAKRY ALEXROVITCH CAME TWICE THAT EVENING SHUFFLING ALONG IN HIS GLASHES AS FAR AS THE DOOR AND STOPPED AND LOOKED INGRATIATINGLY AT PIERRE
1650-173552-0000 AT THAT VERY TIME AT TEN IN THE MORNING OF THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER NAPOLEON WAS STANDING AMONG HIS TROOPS ON THE PYRCONIAN HILL LOOKING AT THE PANORAMAS SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM
1650-173552-0001 THE BRIGHTNESS OF A MORNING WAS MAGICAL
1650-173552-0002 BUT THE MY CLEMENCY IS ALWAYS READY TO DESCEND UPON THE VANQUISHED
1650-173552-0003 YET HERE SHE IS LYING AT MY FEET WITH HER GOLDEN DOMES AND CROSSES CINCILLATING IN A TWINKLING IN THE SUNSHINE
1650-173552-0004 OR I SHALL SPARE HER
1650-173552-0005 FROM THE HIDE OF THE KREMELIN YES THE HERE IS THE KREMELIN YES I WILL GIVE THEM JUST THE LOWS I WILL TEACH THEM THE MEANING OF TRUE CIVILIZATION I WILL MAKE GENERATIONS OF BOYARS REMEMBER THEIR CONQUEROR WITH LAUD
1650-173552-0006 I WILL TELL THE DEPUTATION THAT I DENOUNCE AND DO NOT DESIRE WAR THAT I'LL WAGE THE WAR ONLY AGAINST THE FALSE POLICY OF THE COURT THAT I LOVE AND RESPECT ALEXANDER AND THAT IN MASSACRE I WILL ACCEPT TERMS OF PEACE WORTHY OF MYSELF AND OF MY PEOPLE
1650-173552-0007 I DO NOT WISH TO UTILIZE THE FORCES OF WAR TO HUMILIATE AND HONOUR THE MONARCH
1650-173552-0008 HE WILL HAVE TO BE TOLD ALL THE SAME SAID SOME GENTLEMEN OF THE SUITE BUT GENTLEMEN
1650-173552-0009 A SINGLE REPORT OF THE SINKING GUN FOLLOWED AND THE TROOPS WHO WERE ALREADY SPREAD OUT ON DIFFERENT SIDES SOUTH MOSCOW MOVED INTO THE CITY THROUGH VORD KOLOUGA AND DARGOMALEVKAS
1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER FOR WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED A MAJESTIC TEACHER OF MORAL AND POLITICAL WISDOM
1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH HE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH HE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FOUR OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO ANSWER IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN TO NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED ITS TITLE
1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMBLED TOGETHER IN AS AWED A MANNER AS HE WOULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE EFFECT
1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS JOHNSON'S ABBREVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD WAS MENTIONED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT
1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF BAD HABITS NEGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL ALL CHANGED BY TIME
1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENCE OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING AS THE UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
1651-136854-0009 YOUTH AMBITIOUS AS THINKING HONOUR'S EASY TO BE HAD
1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRAISE ARE PURSUED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCIABLE MANHOOD
1651-136854-0012 WHICH
1651-136854-0013 SCHOLAR'S FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADY
1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO HIM BY WORDS REPELLED BY PASSIONS
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING THE OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY RETURN
1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY HINDERS IMPLIANCE
1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCES INSOLENCE IN ENVY
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARDS IN EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST TOO LITTLE
1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIORS EVERY ONE KNOWS THIS INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS AND AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN INTEREST
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED SCARCE YET WITHOUT CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MANY AGAINST SIX
1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO WRONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTIONS FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND A MORE READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO REGARD AND EXCITE AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN USELESS WISE AND INNOCENT AND A DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND HOLY
1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENIES YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTION OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVED FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 NUMBER THIRTY TWO OF PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANT OF STOICISM AS THE SUN OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENTENCES WAS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRATES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABBLER TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT IN AN LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTERWOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES DIFFER AS PLAIN CLOTH OR BROCADE
1686-142278-0000 WHO WAS GONE
1686-142278-0001 NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES OR CRIMSON OR AMBER TINTS
1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK THE HAPPY SKETCHING CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN
1686-142278-0003 HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANY THING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH THE REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF ITS BRIEF SUCCESS AND ALL THE SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECTS OF HIS DESIRES OH DEAR
1686-142278-0004 THE MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WHIRL OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER
1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET MADE THE RESPONSES ALL TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0006 SHE FELT THAT HE HAD NOT MADE THEM AN OFFER
1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF A LONG EVENING AND WISHING BED TIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN
1686-142278-0008 ALL
1686-142278-0009 I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY CURIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0010 VERY SERIOUS IN US ALL
1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH HER FATHER AFTER HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE STILL FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER CARLYLE DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THAT SIGHT OF THIS SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0015 BUT NOW DEAR PAPA DO TELL ME
1686-142278-0016 BECAUSE I MUST NO LONGER BE A MINISTER AT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
1686-142278-0017 BUT NOTHING TO THE SHOCK SHE RECEIVED FROM MISTER HALE'S LAST SPEECH WHAT COULD IT MEAN
1686-142278-0018 IT WAS ALSO THE WORSE FOR BEING SO MYSTERIOUS
1686-142278-0019 WHY CAN WE NO LONGER BE A CLERGYMAN
1686-142278-0020 SURELY IF THE BISHOP WERE TOLD ALL WE KNOW ABOUT PETER AND THE HARD AND JUST
1686-142278-0021 MARGUERITE I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
1686-142278-0022 I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTION THIS ONCE BUT AFTER TONIGHT LET US NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN
1686-142278-0023 I CAN METE THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY PAINFUL MISERABLE DOUBTS AND IT IS AN EFFORT BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING
1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION NOR THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THAT HE PAUSED
1686-142278-0025 MARGARET SIGHED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEW ERROR
1686-142278-0026 MARGARET HOW I LOVE THOSE HOLY CHURCH FROM WHICH I AM TO BE SHUT OUT
1686-142278-0027 HE COULD GO ON FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
1686-142278-0028 MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WAS ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETIAN
1686-142278-0029 THE ONE STATED FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING
1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THAT CAUSE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW INVOLVED
1686-142278-0031 LISTEN DEAR MARGARET SAID HE PUTTING HER ARM ROUND HER WAIST
1686-142278-0032 NOW GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND YET HE WILL IN ANOTHER
1686-142278-0033 IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDST A NECESSITY FOR IT AN ORDER TO A CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY
1686-142278-0034 AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE WHICH HE COULD NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING
1686-142278-0035 I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACH THAT WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MIND MORE TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE
1686-142278-0036 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD HE WENT ON
1686-142278-0037 MARGARET I TRIED TO DO IT I TRIED TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THAT ADDITIONAL PREFERMENT AND STOPPING QUIETLY HERE STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
1686-142278-0038 OH GOD FORGIVE ME
1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING LONG WORDS OF SELF REPROACH AND HUMILIATION OF WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT A FEW
1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD AND BURTHEN WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE
1686-142278-0041 JUST
1686-142278-0042 I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP I DARESAY I'VE TOLD YOU SO BUT I FORGET THINGS JUST NOW SAID MISTER HALE COLLAPSING INTO HIS DEPRESSED MANNER AS SOON AS HE CAME TO TALK OF HARD MATTER OF FACT DETAILS INFORMING HIM OF MY INTENTION TO RESIGN HIS VICARAGE
1686-142278-0043 THEY ARE WHAT I HAVE TRIED UPON MYSELF WITHOUT A WAIL
1686-142278-0044 THAT WILL BE A TRIAL AND WORSE FAR WORSE WILL BE THE DEPARTING FROM MY DEAR PEOPLE
1686-142278-0045 AND HE WILL COME TO STAY WITH US TO MORROW
1686-142278-0046 WAS HE TO BE SO SUDDEN THEN
1686-142278-0047 WHAT DOES MAN SAY
1686-142278-0048 MARGARET I AM A POOR COWARD AFTER ALL I CANNOT DARE TO GIVE PAIN

1686-142278-0050 PERHAPS AFTER ALL THAT SHE MAY NOT OH YES
1686-142278-0051 SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED AS THE FORCE OF THAT BLOW RETURNED UPON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALIZE HOW ANOTHER WOULD TAKE IT
1686-142278-0052 TO MILTON MODERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DULL INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENNESS OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER MIND
1686-142278-0053 MILTON ELEVEN
1686-142278-0054 YES SIGHED HE IN THE SAME DESPONDENT INDIFFERENT WAY
1686-142278-0055 BUT HE WITH HIS QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ IN HER FACE AS IN THE MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNED IT OFF WITH AN EFFORT
1686-142278-0056 HE SHALL BE TOLD ALL MARGARET
1686-142278-0057 ONLY HELP ME TO KILL YOUR MOTHER

1686-142278-0060 MARGARET DID DISLIKE IT DID SHRINK FROM IT MORE THAN FROM ANYTHING SHE HAD EVER HAD TO IN HER LIFE BEFORE
1686-142278-0061 MISTER HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDINGLY HE PRESSED MY HAND IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
1686-142278-0062 MARGARET WAS NEARLY UPSET AGAIN INTO HER BURST OF CRYING
1686-142278-0063 TO TURN OUR THOUGHTS SHE SAID NOW TELL ME PAPA WHAT OUR PLANS ARE

1686-142278-0077 HIS PRIVATE TUTOR

1701-141759-0017 SHE BELIEVE IT COULD BE BUT DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT
1701-141759-0018 CAN YOU WRITE TO HIM SHE ASKED
1701-141759-0019 NOW THAT HE WAS ALREADY AN OFFICER AND A WOUNDED HERO WOULD IT BE RIGHT TO REMIND HIM OF HERSELF AND AS IT MIGHT SEEM OF THE OBLIGATIONS TO HER HE HAD TAKEN OF HIMSELF
1701-141759-0020 WE DON'T KNOW
1701-141759-0021 SONYA SMILES SO
1701-141759-0022 IT'S BECAUSE SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THAT FAT ONE IN SPECTACLES THAT WAS HOW PETYA DESCRIBED HIS NAMESAKE THE NEW COUNT BEZUKHOV AND NOW SHE'S IN LOVE WITH THAT SINGER HE MEANT NATASHA'S ITALIAN SINGING MASTER THAT'S WHY SHE'S ASHAMED

1701-141759-0025 ON RETIRING TO HER OWN ROOM SHE SAT IN AN ARMCHAIR HER EYES FIXED ON A MINIATURE PORTRAIT OF HER SON ON THE LID OF HER SNUFF BOX WHILE THE TEARS KEPT COMING INTO HER EYES
1701-141759-0026 THE COUNTESS PUT HIS EAR TO THE KEY HOLE AND LISTENED
1701-141759-0027 AT FIRST HE HEARD THE SOUND OF INDIFFERENT VOICES THEN ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S VOICE ALONE IN A LONG SPEECH THEN THE CRY THEN SILENCE THEN BOTH VOICES TOGETHER WITH GLAD INTONATIONS AND THEN FOOTSTEPS
1701-141759-0028 ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OPENED THE GATE
1701-141759-0029 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS SONYA BLUSHED SO THAT TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES AND UNABLE TO BEAR THE LOOKS TURNED UPON HER RAN AWAY INTO THE DANCING HALL WHIRLED ROUND IT AT FULL SPEED WITH HER DRESS PUFFED UP LIKE A BALLOON AND FLUSHED AND SMILING PLUMPED DOWN ON THE FLOOR
1701-141759-0030 THE COUNTESS WAS SAYING
1701-141759-0031 FROM ALL SHE SAYS ONE SHOULD BE GLAD AND NOT CRY
1701-141759-0032 HOW CHARMINGLY HE DESCRIBES SAID SHE READING THE DESCRIPTIVE PART OF THE LETTER AND WHAT A SIGHT
1701-141759-0033 I ALWAYS SAID WHAT HE WAS ONLY SO HIGH I ALWAYS SAID
1701-141760-0000 THE PAVLOV GRADES HELD FEAST AFTER FEAST CELEBRATING AWARDS THEY HAD RECEIVED FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND MADE EXPEDITIONS TO ALLMUTS TO VISIT A CERTAIN CAROLINA HUNGARIAN WHO HAD RECENTLY OPENED A RESTAURANT THERE WITH GIRLS AS WAITRESSES
1701-141760-0001 THEIR GUARDS HAD MADE THEIR WHOLE MARCH AS IF ON A PLEASURE TRIP PARADING THEIR CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE
1701-141760-0002 THE REGIMENTS HAD ENTERED AND LEFT THE TOWN WITH THEIR BANDS PLAYING AND BY THE GRAND DUKE'S ORDERS THE MEN HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY IN STEPS A PRACTICE ON WHICH THE GUARDS PRIDED THEMSELVES THE OFFICERS ON FOOT AND AT THEIR PROPER POSTS
1701-141760-0003 BORIS HAD BEEN QUARTERED AND HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY WITH BERG WHO WAS ALREADY IN COMMAND OF THIS COMPANY
1701-141760-0004 BORIS DURING THE CAMPAIGN HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MANY PERSONS WHO MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO HIM AND BY A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION HE HAD BROUGHT FROM PIERRE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKIO WHOM HE HOPED TO OBTAIN A POST ON THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF STAFF
1701-141760-0005 BIRKE AND BORIS HAVING RESTED AFTER YESTERDAY'S MARCH WERE SITTING CLEAN AND NEATLY DRESSED AT A ROUND TABLE IN THE CLEAN QUARTERS ALLOTTED TO THEM PLAYING CHESS
1701-141760-0006 WELL HOW ARE YE GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT HE REMARKED
1701-141760-0007 AT THAT MOMENT THIS DOOR OPENED
1701-141760-0008 DEAR ME WHAT YOU HAVE CHANGED
1701-141760-0009 HE WAS ABOUT TO EMBRACE HIS PRINCE BUT NICHOLAS AVOIDED HIM
1701-141760-0010 I WANTED TO PINCH HIM PUSH HIM DO ANYTHING BUT KISS HIM A THING EVERYBODY DID
1701-141760-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS BORIS EMBRACED HIM IN A QUIET FRIENDLY WAY KISSED HIM THREE TIMES
1701-141760-0012 THEY HAD NOT MET FOR NEARLY HALF A YEAR AND BEING AT THE AGE WHEN YOUNG MEN TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS ON LIFE'S ROAD EACH SAW IMMENSE CHANGES IN THE OTHER QUITE A NEW REFLECTION OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH HE HAD TAKEN THOSE FIRST STEPS

1701-141760-0020 OH DON'T MENTION IT AUNT I QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID BORG GETTING UP AND SPEAKING IN A MUFFLED AND GUTTURAL VOICE
1701-141760-0021 GO ACROSS TO OUR HOMES THEY INVITED YOU ADDED BORIS
1701-141760-0022 BERG PUT ON THE CLEANEST OF COATS WITHOUT A SPOT OR SPECK OF DUST STOOD BEFORE A LOOKING GLASS AND BRUSHED THE HAIR ON HIS TEMPLES UPWARDS IN THE WAY AFFECTED BY THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF FROM THE WAY ROSTOV LOOKED AT IT THAT HIS COAT HAD BEEN NOTICED LEFT THE ROOM WITH A PLEASING SMILE
1701-141760-0023 NO DEAR WHAT A BEAST I AM MUTTERED ROSTOV AS HE READ THE LETTER WHY
1701-141760-0024 WHAT HAVE YOU SENT GABRIEL FOR SOME WINE ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE SOME
1701-141760-0025 IN THE LETTER FROM HIS PARENTS WAS ENCLOSED A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION TO BAGRATION WHICH THE OLD COUNTESS IN ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S ADVICE HAD OBTAINED THROUGH AN ACQUAINTANCE AND SENT TO HER SON ASKING HIM TO TAKE IT TO ITS DESTINATION AND MAKE USE OF IT
1701-141760-0026 WHY HAVE YOU THROWN WHAT AWAY ASKED BORIS
1701-141760-0027 IT IS MY LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT THE DEVIL DO I WANT IT FOR
1701-141760-0028 HE LOOKED INTENTLY AND INQUIRINGLY INTO HIS BROTHER'S EYES EVIDENTLY TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND THE ANSWER TO SOME QUESTION
1701-141760-0029 WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT COUNT I WAS NOT AT ALL ALARMED SINCE I KNEW I WAS RIGHT
1701-141760-0030 I CAME FORWARD BERGS STOOD UP AND SHOWED HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR A FACE TO EXPRESS GREATER RESPECT AND SELF COMPLACENCY THAN HIS DID
1701-141760-0031 WELL HE STORMED AT ME AS THE SAYING IS STORMED AND STORMED AND STAMPED
1701-141760-0032 IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF LOVE BUT RATHER OF DEATH AS THE SAYING IS
1701-141760-0033 ALBANIANS AND DEVILS AN TO SIBERIA SAID BERG WITH A SAGACIOUS SMILE
1701-141760-0034 STILL I REMAINED SILENT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK COUNTS
1701-141760-0035 THE NEXT DAY IT WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY
1701-141760-0036 THAT'S THE WAY ABOUT SAID BERG LIGHTING HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE
1701-141760-0037 YES THAT WAS NICE SAID ROSTOV SMILING
1701-141760-0038 ROSTOV WAS A TRUTHFUL YOUNG MAN AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT BE TOLD A DELIBERATE LIE
1701-141760-0039 HE BEGAN HIS STORY MEANING TO TELL EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAPPENED BUT IMPERCEPTIBLY INVOLUNTARILY OR INEVITABLY HE LAPSED INTO FALSEHOOD
1701-141760-0040 PRINCE ANDREW WHO LIKED TO HELP THE YOUNG MEN WAS FLATTERED BY BEING ASKED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE AND BEING WELL DISPOSED TOWARD BORIS WHO HAD MANAGED TO PLEASE HIM THE DAY BEFORE HE WISHED TO DO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WANTED
1701-141760-0041 IN SPITE OF PRINCE ANDREW'S DISAGREEABLE IRONICAL TONE IN SPITE OF THE CONTENT WITH WHICH ROSTOV FROM HIS FIGHTING PARTY POINT OF VIEW REGARDED ALL THESE LITTLE ADJUTANTS ON THE STAFF OF WHOM THE NEWCOMER WAS EVIDENTLY ONE ROSTOV FELT CONFUSED BLUSHED AND BECAME SILENT
1701-141760-0042 BORIS INQUIRED WHAT NEWS THERE MIGHT BE ON HIS STAFF AND WHAT WITHOUT INDISCRETION ONE MIGHT ASK ABOUT OUR PLANS
1701-141760-0043 WE SHALL PROBABLY ADVANCE REPLIED BOLKOTSKI EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO SAY MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER
1701-141760-0044 BYRNE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WITH GREAT POLITENESS WHETHER AS WAS RUMOURED THE ALLOWANCE OF FORAGE MONEY TO CAPTAINS OF COMPANIES WOULD BE DOUBLED
1701-141760-0045 I WAS THERE SAID ROSTOV ANGRILY AS IF INTENDING TO CONSULT THE AIDE DE CAMP
1701-141760-0046 WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HE SAID WELL THERE ARE MANY STORIES NOW TOLD ABOUT THAT AFFAIR
1701-141760-0047 BUT OUR STORIES ARE THE STORIES OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER THAT ENEMY'S FIRE
1701-141760-0048 OUR STORIES HAVE SUCH WEIGHT NOT LIKE THE STORIES OF THOSE FELLOWS ON THE STAFF WHO GET REWARDS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
1701-141760-0049 HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME BUT DON'T FORGET THAT I DID NOT REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED AND AS A MAN OLDER THAN YOU MY ADVICE IS TO LET THE MATTER DROP
1701-141760-0050 EXCLAIMED SAINT ANDREW AND WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH HE WENT OUT
1701-141760-0051 AND HE WAS STILL MORE ANGRY AT HAVING OMITTED TO SEE HIM
1701-141760-0052 HE ORDERED HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND COLDLY TAKING LEAVE OF BORIS RODE UP
1701-141760-0053 SHOULD HE GO TO HEADQUARTERS NEXT DAY AND CHALLENGE THAT AFFECTED ADJUTANT TO REALLY LET THE MATTER DROP WAS THE QUESTION THAT WORRIED HIM ALL THE WAY
2506-11267-0000 ICY SHORES OF MEN DEPART NOT PERHAPS WITHOUT AN INNATE LONGING TOO TO QUIT THE ISLAND ALONG WITH THOSE HAPPY SNOBS
2506-11267-0001 FAREWELL DEAR FRIENDS I SAY YOU LITTLE KNOW THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO REGARDS YOU FROM THE BEACH IS YOUR FRIEND AND HISTORIOGRAPHER AND A BROTHER

2506-11267-0005 MY LADY MARCHIONESS COMES ON BOARD LOOKS ROUND WITH THAT HAPPY AIR OF MINGLED TERROR AND IMPERTINENCE WHICH DISTINGUISHES HER LADYSHIP AND RUSHES TO HER CARRIAGE BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD MINGLE WITH THE OTHER SNOBS ON DECK
2506-11267-0006 THERE SHE SITS AND WE WILL BE ILL IN PRIVATE

2506-169427-0001 AS THE READER FOR I HATE YOUR RIFTS HAS A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE I NEED NOT SAY MORE TO SATISFY HIM THAT MY HERO CAN NOT GO ON AT THIS RATE WITHOUT SOME SLIGHT EXPERIENCE OF THESE INCIDENTAL MEMENTOES
2506-169427-0002 TO SPEAK THE TRUTH HE HAD WANTONLY INVOLVED HIMSELF IN A MULTITUDE OF SMALL BOOKED DEBTS OF THIS STAMP WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING EUGENIUS'S FREQUENT ADVICE HE TOO MUCH DISREGARDED THINKING THAT AS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS CONTRACTED THROUGH ANY MALIGNANCY BUT ON THE CONTRARY FROM AN HONESTY OF MIND AND A MERE JOCUNDITY OF HUMOR THEY WOULD ALL OF THEM BE CROSSED OUT IN COURSE
2506-169427-0003 EUGENIUS WOULD NEVER ADMIT THIS AND WOULD OFTEN TELL HIM THAT ONE DAY OR OTHER HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE RECKONED WITH AND HE WOULD OFTEN ADD IN AN ACCENT OF SORROWFUL APPREHENSION TO THAT UTTERMOST MIGHT
2506-169427-0004 WHAT INCLINED EUGENIE TO THE SAME OPINION WAS AS FOLLOWS
2506-169427-0005 YORICK FOLLOWED EUGENUS WITH HIS EYE TO THE DOOR HE THEN CLOSED THEM AND NEVER OPENED THEM MORE

3660-172182-0002 THEN THERE SOUNDED THE DEATH HORN FOR SLAYING AND THEY ALL GATHERED ROUND
3660-172182-0003 ONE WISHED THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE LADY BEST BELOVED BY HIM AND OTHER TO THE LADY WHOM HE LOVED BEST
3660-172182-0004 AND AFTER MIDDAY THEY BEHELD AN UNSHAPELY LITTLE MAN UPON A HORSE AND AFTER HIM A DAME AND A DAMSEL ALSO ON HORSEBACK AND AFTER HER A KNIGHT OF LARGE STATURE BOWED DOWN AND HANGING HIS HEAD LOW AND SORROWFULLY AND CLAD IN BROKEN AND WORTHLESS ARMOUR
3660-172182-0005 I KNOW NOT WHO THEY ARE SAID HE BUT I KNOW SAID GUINEVER THIS IS THE KNIGHT WHOM JERAINE PURSUED AND METHINKS THAT HE COMES NOT HERE BY HIS OWN FREE WILL
3660-172182-0006 BUT DURRANTE HAS OVERTAKEN HIM AND AVENGED THE INSULT TO THE MAIDEN TO THE UTTERMOST
3660-172182-0007 LADIES SAID HE AT THE GATE THERE WAS A KNIGHT AND I SAW NEVER A MAN OF SO PITIFUL AN ASPECT TO LOOK UPON AS HE
3660-172182-0008 I DO SAID HE HE TELLS ME THAT HE IS EDERIN THE SON OF NUND
3660-172182-0009 THAN SHE REPLIED I KNOW HIM NOT
3660-172182-0010 SO GUENEVER WENT TO THE GATE TO MEET HIM AND HE ENTERED IT
3660-172182-0011 AND DURANT GREETS THEE WELL AND IN GREETING THEE HE COMPELLED ME TO COME HITHER TO DO THY PLEASURE FOR THE INSULT WHICH THY MAIDENS RECEIVED FROM THE DWARF NO WHERE DID HE OVERTAKE THEE

3660-172182-0014 I AM LORD SAID HE THEN I HAVE MET WITH MUCH TROUBLE AND RECEIVED WOUNDS UNSUPPORTABLE
3660-172182-0015 THEN SAID ARTHUR FROM WHAT I HEAR IT BEHOVES GWENEVER TO BE MERCIFUL TOWARDS THEE
3660-172182-0016 THE MERCY WHICH THOU DESIREST LORD SAID HE WILL I GRANT TO HIM SINCE IT IS AS INSULTING TO THEE THAT AN INSULT SHOULD BE OFFERED TO ME AS TO THYSELF
3660-172182-0017 THEN WILL IT BE BEST TO DO SAID ARTHUR LET THIS MAN HAVE MEDICAL CARE UNTIL IT BE KNOWN WHETHER HE MAY LIVE
3660-172182-0018 TO GUENEVER AND HER HANDMAIDENS HE
3660-172182-0019 AND THE STEWARD OF THE HOUSEHOLD SO ORDERED THE

3660-172182-0021 WHEN DURRANT CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE GUENEVER WAS HE SALUTED HER
3660-172182-0022 THEN THEY WENT OUT AND DISMOUNTED
3660-172182-0023 HEAVEN PROTECT THEE SAID ARTHUR IN THE WELCOME OF HEAVEN BE UNTO THEE
3660-172182-0024 AND INASMUCH AS THOU HAST VANQUISHED EDINRAN THE SON OF NUD THOU HAST HAD A PROSPEROUS CAREER
3660-172182-0025 AND FROM THAT TIME SHE BECAME ITS WIFE
3660-172182-0026 AND THE MAIDEN TOOK UP HER ABODE AT THE PALACE AND SHE HAD MANY COMPANIONS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND THERE WAS NO MAIDEN MORE ESTEEMED THAN SHE IN THE ISLAND OF BRITAIN
3660-172182-0027 AND A YEAR AND A SECOND AND A THIRD HE PROCEEDED THUS UNTIL HIS FAME HAS FLOWN OVER THE FACE OF THE KINGDOM
3660-172182-0028 AND HE GREETS THEE WELL AS AN UNCLE SHOULD GREET HIS NEPHEW AND AS A VASSAL SHALL GREET HIS LORD
3660-172182-0029 THE NEIGHBOURING CHIEFS KNOWING THIS GROW INSOLENT TOWARD HIM AND COVERT HIS LAND AND POSSESSIONS
3660-172182-0030 AND ARTHUR TOLD GERRANT THE CAUSE OF THE MISSION AND OF THE COMING OF THE AMBASSADORS TO HIM OUT OF CORNWALL TRULY SAID URRAINT BE IT TO MY ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE LORD I WILL DO ACCORDING TO THY WILL CONCERNING THIS EMBASSY
3660-172182-0031 WHAT INTERCOURSE SAID GWENEVER DO I HEAR BETWEEN YOU
3660-172182-0032 SAID CURRANT I THINK I SHALL HAVE ENOUGH OF KNIGHTHOOD WITH ME AND THEY SET FORTH
3660-172182-0033 AND NEVER WAS THERE SEEN A FAIRER HOST JOURNEYING ACROSS THE SEVERN
3660-172182-0034 AND HE SAID TO DURRANT I AM A FEEBLE AND AN AGED MAN AND WHILST I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE REMAINS FOR THEE AND FOR MYSELF I DID SO
3660-172182-0035 AND EVERY ONE ASKED THAT WHICH SHE DESIRED
3660-172182-0036 AND THEY WERE NOT LONG IN MAKING SO EAGER WAS EVERY ONE TO BESTOW GIFTS AND OF THOSE WHO CAME TO ASK GIFTS NONE DEPARTED UNSATISFIED
3660-172182-0037 THEN GERRAIN SENT EMBASSES TO THE MEN OF CORNWALL TO ASK THEM MISS
3660-172182-0038 AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WOULD BE THE FULNESS OF JOY AND HONOR TO THEM FOR DURRANT TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR HOMAGE
3660-172182-0039 SO HE RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF SUCH AS WE THERE
3660-172182-0040 AND THE DAY AFTER THE FOLLOWERS OF EITHER INTENDED TO GO AWAY
3660-172183-0000 JURAINT AS HE HAD BEEN USED TO DO WHEN HE WAS AT ARTHUR'S COURT FREQUENTED TOURNAMENTS
3660-172183-0001 BEFORE DURINGT THE SCOURGE OF THE ENEMY I SAW STEEDS WHITE WITH FOAM AND AFTER THE SHOUT OF BATTLE A FEARFUL TORRENT
3660-172183-0002 THESE TIDINGS CAME TO ROBAN
3660-172183-0003 BUT I BY MY CONFESSION UNTO HEAVEN SAID SHE THERE IS NOTHING MORE HATEFUL UNTO ME THAN THIS
3660-172183-0004 AND THE TEARS SHE SAID AND THE WORDS SHE HAD SPOKEN AWOKE THEM
3660-172183-0005 AN EVIL BETIDE ME SAID HE IF THOU RETURNEST HERE UNTIL THOU KNOWEST WHERE I HAVE LOST MY STRENGTH SO COMPLETELY AS THOU DIDST SAY
3660-172183-0006 THEN DERAINE WENT TO SEE URBAN
3660-172183-0007 SIR SAID HE I AM GOING UPON A QUEST AND I AM NOT CERTAIN WHEN I WILL COME BACK
3660-172183-0008 TAKE HEED HOWEVER UNTO THY POSSESSIONS UNTIL MY RETURN
3660-172183-0009 BUT ONE QUESTION ONLY WILL GO WITH ME
3660-172183-0010 AND HE DESIRED ENID TO MOUNT HER HORSE AND TO RIDE FORWARD AND TO GET A LONG WAY BEFORE HIM
3660-172183-0011 AND THUS I SPEAK UNTO THEE SAY NOT THOU ONE WORD EITHER
3660-172183-0012 AND THOUGH THOU SHOULDST DESIRE TO SEE MY DEFEATS AND MY DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THOSE MEN YET DO I FEEL NO DREAD
3660-172183-0013 AND HE SAVED HIM AND THAT NOT FEEBLY
3660-172183-0014 AND SAY NAUGHT ONE WORD UNTO ME UNLESS I SPEAK FIRST UNTO THEE
3660-172183-0015 I WILL DO AS WELL AS I CAN LORD SAID SHE ACCORDING TO THY DESIRE
3660-172183-0016 AH MAIDEN SAID HE IT IS VAIN TO ATTEMPT PROCEEDING
3660-172183-0017 I CANNOT BY ANY MEANS REFRAIN FROM SLEEP THOUGH WEARINESS SAID HE DO THOU THEREFORE WATCH THE HORSES AND SLEEP NOT
3660-172183-0018 AND WHEN SHE SAW THE DAWN OF DAY APPEAR SHE LOOKED ROUND HER TO SEE IF HE WAS WAKING AND THEREUPON HE WOKE
3660-172183-0019 AND THEY LEFT THE WOOD AND THEY CAME TO AN OPEN COUNTRY WITH MEADOWS ON ONE HAND AND MOWES MOWING THE MEADOWS
3660-172183-0020 MY LORD HE ADDED WILL THAT BE DISPLEASING TO THEE IF I ASK WHENCE THOU COMEST ALSO
3660-172183-0021 WILT THOU FOUL MY COUNSEL SAID THE YOUTH AND TAKE THY MEAL WITH ME
3660-172183-0022 WHAT SORT OF MULE HE INQUIRED
3660-172183-0023 THEN THEY WASHED OR TOOK THEIR REPAST
3660-172183-0024 I GO NOW LORD SAID HE TO MEET THE KNIGHT AND TO CONDUCT HIM TO THIS LODGING
3660-172183-0025 I WILL KNOW LORD SAID SHE AS THOU SAYEST
3660-172183-0026 AND AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRANK JEHRAINE WENT TO SLEEP AND SO DID ENID ALSO
3660-6517-0000 THE DATE SEEMED UNIMPORTANT BUT THROUGHOUT THAT PERIOD THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE SHIP HAVE BEEN UNREMITTINGLY BUSY
3660-6517-0001 BOWERS ATTACKED THE SHIP'S STORES SURVEYED REMLISTED AND RESTOWED THEM SAVING VERY MUCH SPACE BY UNSTOWING NUMEROUS CASES AND STOWING THE CONTENTS IN THE LAZARETTE
3660-6517-0002 WITHOUT STEAM THE LEAK CAN NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH THE HANDS PUMP BY TWO DAILY EFFORTS OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES
3660-6517-0003 AS A SHIP WAS AND IN HER PRESENT HEAVILY LADEN CONDITION IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE OR FOUR HOURS EACH DAY
3660-6517-0004 THE LARGE GREEN TENT WAS PUT UP AND PROPER SUPPORTS MADE TO IT
3660-6517-0005 THE ENGINE ROOMS STAFF ANDERSON'S PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOWING THEIR LABORATORIES THE COOK REFITTING HIS GALLEY AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD ITS BAND OF WORKERS
3660-6517-0006 THE MAIN'S SPACE SUCH AS IT IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FORE HATCH TO THE STEM ON THE MAIN DECK
3660-6517-0007 UNDER THE FORECASTLE ARE STALLS OF FIFTY PONIES THE MAXIMUM THE SPACE WOULD HOLD THE NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT IS PACKED TIGHT WITH FODDER
3660-6517-0008 IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FORECASTLE BALADE IS A SMALL BOOBY HATCH THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE MEN'S MESS DECK IN BAD WEATHER
3660-6517-0009 ABAFT THE FORE HATCHING THE ICE HOUSE
3660-6517-0010 WE MANAGED TO GET THREE TONS OF ICE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO CARCASES OF MUTTON AND THREE CARCASES OF BEEF BESIDES SOME BOXES OF SWEETBREADS AND KIDNEYS INTO THIS SPACE
3660-6517-0011 THE SACKS CONTAINING THIS LAST ADDED TO THE GOODS ALREADY MENTIONED MAKE A REALLY HEAVY DEC CAGO AND ONE IS NATURALLY ANXIOUS CONCERNING IT BUT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY LASHING AND SECURING HAS BEEN DONE
3660-6517-0012 FORAGE I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIRTY TONS OF COMPRESSED OAT AND HAY FOR MELBOURNE
3660-6517-0013 THE SCENE IS WHOLLY ENCHANTING AND SUCH A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER IN A GARDEN WHICH BLAZED WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION WITH ALL THINGS
3660-6517-0014 A GREAT MASS OF PEOPLE AS ASSEMBLED
3660-6517-0015 KAY AND I LUNCH WITH THE PARTY IN THE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY'S SHIP RUPA HOO
3660-6517-0016 TELEGRAM TO SAY TERRANOVA HAD ARRIVED SUNDAY
3660-6517-0017 THE THIRD SLEDGE STANDS ACROSS THE BREAK OF THE POOP AND THE SPACE HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY THE AFTER WINCH
3660-6517-0018 THE QUANTITY IS TWO AND A HALF TONS AND THE PACE OCCUPIED CONSIDERABLE
3660-6517-0019 THE SHIP WAS OVER TWO FEET BY HER STERN BUT THIS WILL SOON BE REMEDIED
3660-6517-0020 THEY MUST PERFORCE BE CHAINED UP AND THEY ARE GIVEN WHAT SHELTER IS AFFORDED ON DECK BUT THEIR POSITION WAS NOT ENVIABLE
3660-6517-0021 IT IS A PATHETIC ATTITUDE DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY OCCASIONALLY SOME POOR BEAST EMITS A LOW PATHETIC WHINE
3660-6517-0022 THERE ARE GENERALLY ONE OR TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASES MATTERS AND IT IS A SQUASH
3660-6517-0023 LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND HAS VEERED TO THE WESTWARD HEADING US EXACTLY
3660-6517-0024 OATES AND ATKINSON WITH INTERMITTENT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER WERE BUSY KEEPING THE PONIES ON THEIR LEGS
3660-6517-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EVIL AND NEARLY ALL HANDS WERE LABOURING FOR HOURS IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP HEAVING COALS SACKS OVERBOARD AND RELASHING THE PETROL CASES ET CETERA IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
3660-6517-0026 NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED THAN SOME EXCEPTIONABLY HEAVY WAVE WOULD TEAR AWAY THE LASHING AND THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN
3660-6517-0027 FROM THIS MOMENT ABOUT THREE A M THE ENGINE ROOM BECAME THE CENTRE OF INTEREST
3660-6517-0028 THE WATER BENT IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT
3660-6517-0029 THE OUTLOOK APPEARED GRIM AND
3660-6517-0030 THE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH WAS BEING MADE WITH THE SHIP SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS MUCH UNCERTAIN
3660-6517-0031 WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW FIRES WHATEVER WAS TO BE DONE
3660-6517-0032 THE BILGE PUMP WAS DEPENDENT ON THE MAIN ENGINE
3660-6517-0033 ON ONE OCCASION I WAS WAISTS DEEP WHEN STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THE POOP
3660-6517-0034 THE AFTERGUARD WERE ORGANIZED IN TWO PARTIES BY EVANS TO WORK BUCKETS THE MEN WERE KEPT STEADILY GOING IN THE CHOKED HAND PUMPS THIS SEEMED ALL THAT COULD BE DONE FOR THE MOMENT AND WHAT A MEASURE TO COUNT AS THE SOLE SAFEGUARD OF THE SHIP FROM SINKING PRACTICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BAIL HER OUT
3660-6517-0035 OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD CARRY ONE OF THEM AWAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED BY HIS CHAIN
3663-172005-0000 THE FAWN HAD TAKEN HIS MORNING MEAL AND NOW LAY CURLED UP IN A BED OF MOSS
3663-172005-0001 WHENEVER THE FAWN CAUGHT ONE HE WAS QUITE CONTENT TO FRISK ABOUT
3663-172005-0002 THE DANGER WAS DIFFERENT NOW IT WAS NEAR
3663-172005-0003 THE HOUNDS HAD STRUCK THE TRAIL WHEN SHE TURNED AND THE FAWN WAS SAFE
3663-172005-0004 ONE WAS ROLLING THE OTHER HAD A GUN IN HIS HAND WHAT SHOULD SHE DO
3663-172005-0005 HER TIRED LEGS COULD NOT COMPEL THE TIRED BODY RAPIDLY
3663-172005-0006 THE DORE SAW THE BOAT NEARING HER
3663-172005-0007 IN A MOMENT MORE THE BOAT WAS UNDER HER AND THE MEN AT THE OARS HAD LEANED OVER AND CAUGHT HER
3663-172528-0000 I WERE TORMENTED BY THIRST BUT HAD ABSTAINED FROM DRINKING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS
3663-172528-0001 THAT OLD MAN CEASED TO MAKE SO MUCH ANNOYANCE YET SOMETIMES HE APPEARED TO ME IN DREAMS
3663-172528-0002 FELICIA GIVEN HER ORDERS NOT TO SPEAK TO ME OF THIS
3663-172528-0003 HIS MAID HAD STOLEN FROM ME CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND IN HER FEAR OF BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD DIED
3663-172528-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE ALLOWED ME TWICE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FULL AND THEN COVERED MYSELF AND BEGAN TO SWEAT AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
3663-172528-0005 THEY SAY THAT MY POOR FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO GRIEVED WAS HE TO HEAR
3663-172528-0006 AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY STONE AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE SERVING GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT SHOUTING OUT AH TRAITRESS YOU HAVE KILLED HIM FOR ME THEN
3663-172528-0007 SHE MAY INDEED HAVE SAVED MY LIFE BUT LEND ME A HELPING HAND FOR I HAVE SWEATED AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT
3663-172528-0008 FELICIA RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS DROPPED AND MADE ME COMFORTABLE AND I BEING CONSCIOUS OF A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN MY STATE BEGAN TO RECKON ON RECOVERY
3663-172528-0009 JUST THEN THE OTHER DOCTOR BERNARDINO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE AND AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAD REFUSED TO BLEED ME
3663-172528-0010 MAESTRO FRANCESCO A MOST ABLE MAN EXCLAIMED O POWER OF NATURE
3663-172528-0011 SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE PHYSICIANS SEE NOTHING
3663-172528-0012 THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINOS MADE ANSWER SAYING IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED UPON THE SPOT
3663-172528-0013 AFTERWARDS SHE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER
3663-172528-0014 I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED THEIR THIRST
3663-172528-0015 IN A LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED TO BLEED HIM
3663-172528-0016 IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DO YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE
3663-172528-0017 YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF YOUR CURE
3663-172528-0018 AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY PARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN
3663-172528-0019 THE VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN THE CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD
3663-172528-0020 DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME FOR ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM
3663-172528-0021 THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I PRAY YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE
3663-172528-0022 SO I MADE MY MIND OUT AND PREPARED TO TRAVEL
3663-172528-0023 THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIERRE LORDY WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
3663-172528-0024 NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE A GITTO WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
3663-172528-0025 I HAD HARBORED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN BUT THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS
3663-172528-0026 MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DA MONTEVARCI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL
3663-172528-0027 THERE THEY CARRIED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY
3663-172528-0028 MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY THOUGH SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE
3663-172528-0029 AT THESE WORDS MAESTRO AGOSTINO THE DUKE'S TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT IN THIS VERY MOMENT
3663-172528-0030 GIORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MAASTHRO AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED THERE IS THE MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NOT
3663-172528-0031 AND FIERCELY AS I COULD NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED GIORGIO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0032 HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO AND THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THAT SWORD
3663-172528-0033 MAESTRO AUGUSTINO RETORTED YOU ARE GALLOWS BIRD
3663-172528-0034 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT FOR MUCH CERTAIN
3663-172528-0035 GEORGIO WENT OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0036 THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND HE ALTERED
3663-172528-0037 THE YOUTH GAZED AT ME AND MARVELLED I WAS STILL ALIVE AFTERWARDS HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH
3663-172528-0038 WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTERO GUTTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME
3663-172528-0039 I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND TOLD HIM ALL OF THE AFFAIR ABOUT THE MINT
3663-172528-0040 SHE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE YOUR VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT
3663-172528-0041 I THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIETRO PAGOLO ADVISE ABOUT STAMPING THE COINS AND THEN WENT OFF UPON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE DUKE OR ANYBODY ELSE
3663-172528-0042 YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALIZE THAT FEROCIOUS PIRATE
3663-172528-0043 YOU HAVE NEVER READ ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS
3663-172528-0044 IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF DUKE CLEMENT
3663-172528-0045 MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DYES FROM THAT MEDAL
3663-172528-0046 I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE
3663-172528-0047 I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORRENCINO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL
3663-172528-0048 NICCOLO DA MONTER GUTTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENCINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
3663-172528-0049 NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MUST BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
3663-172528-0050 I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THIS WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY
3663-172528-0051 THIS BEING SO AND HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED
3663-172528-0052 I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SILVER BALL
3663-172528-0053 I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS EASILY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING
3663-172528-0054 I SLIPPED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROME
3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING FOUR HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE
3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT PEACE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE
3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADES THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF KEUANA
3915-57461-0003 THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED AND FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED
3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE THEM
3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RONON FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPEN TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
3915-57461-0006 AND NOW ALAS BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE
3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FOOLISHLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM
3915-57461-0008 THEN THE RODON SAID TO THE BOATMAN
3915-57461-0009 WHAT SAY YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS
3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE ROMAN HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONCO OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO
3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVORING HIS PERSECUTIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD
3915-57461-0013 SINCE THEN ALL IS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF
3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE BEAST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR
3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TO KABAY FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERY MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME
3915-57461-0016 NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED AT THE NEXT STREET
3915-57461-0017 AND HIDING HIS HAT UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER
3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO AT THE SUANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT
3915-57461-0019 HAPLY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP THE BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART
3915-57461-0020 ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF THE MARVELLOUS AILMENT
3915-57461-0021 THINKING I COULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS MISTAKEN
3915-57461-0022 AND SHOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALICE
3915-57461-0023 AND REPENT THEREFORE AND ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAYS
3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU DO SO I WOULD ESTEEM THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS
3915-57461-0025 BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YE WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TORMENT YOU
3915-57461-0026 IN THAT FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROB YOU
3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAVE BEEN AND THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOME DAY OVERTAKE ME
3915-57461-0028 HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRIT AND FROM THIS TIME FORTH FELL ILL
3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW THEY MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
3915-57461-0030 A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND WHEN HE SEES WHAT IS NOT
3915-98647-0000 EVERY WELL ORDERED JAPANESE HOME OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTRE OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOUSES
3915-98647-0001 SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY AND ANNIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SENT OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS
3915-98647-0002 THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHER AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE
3915-98647-0003 VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILDREN'S COLLECTION
3915-98647-0004 ALL THESE WERE PUT TOGETHER BY THE TERRIBLE MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT THE CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SON
3915-98647-0005 AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY OF ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE
3915-98647-0006 EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILFUL BALANCER OF PROSE AND KHANS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WOULD BE
3915-98647-0007 FROM THE GREATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE THE HOME PROPHECIES ARE FELT TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN AND THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED IN
3915-98647-0008 NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHATEVER DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR
3915-98647-0009 AFTER THIS MANNER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE IS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES OF ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS
3915-98647-0010 OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHEN THIS ROOF IS RAISED
3915-98647-0011 THE HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS THE LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
3915-98647-0012 A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABOURERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGE POLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCRAMBLED JOYFULLY
3915-98647-0013 ALL COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CANNOT COME SEND SLAVES OR PROVISIONS
3915-98647-0014 ON THE DAY AFTER THIS DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN A CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS THE STYLE COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN
3915-98647-0015 NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES THE SURVIVAL OF THE OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE
3915-98647-0016 AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE HORSE
3915-98647-0017 THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THAT LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL
3915-98647-0018 UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL THAT LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS
3915-98647-0019 WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IT IS DRESSED IN WHITE AN SILK HABO TIE WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT
3915-98647-0020 THE BODY TO BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES THAT POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS
3915-98647-0021 THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THEY ARE PLACED IN THE COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THAT THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD
3915-98647-0022 THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO HIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEED THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH
3915-98647-0023 LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF
3915-98647-0024 SO LONG AS THE CONVENT IS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY
3915-98647-0025 IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING OVER THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES
3915-98647-0026 THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THE REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY
3915-98647-0027 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE FIRST FEATURES OF THESE CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED
3915-98647-0028 A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUKERSAWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING
3915-98647-0029 IN HIS WILL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING IN THE CLOTH IN WHICH HE DIED
3915-98647-0030 THROUGH THIS GROWING FEELING AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES
3915-98647-0031 JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH WAS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY
3915-98647-0032 ON THAT DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT
3915-98647-0033 SOMETIMES WITH THE GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THE BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN
3915-98647-0034 ANOTHER FAVORITE PEASANT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON
3915-98647-0035 IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURAL
3915-98647-0036 DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE AND A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET UP IN THE DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE REARED DAILY
4153-185072-0000 HE TARRIED AT GANESHAW A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP TO GAADO WHERE I THEN RESIDED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE WINTER CAME ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS STAY
4153-185072-0001 THE ENRAGED HUSBAND WELL KNOWING THAT HE SHOULD FEEL A BLOW IF HE WANTED TO HEAR THE ORDER REPEATED INSTANTLY RETREATED AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS CATTLE
4153-185072-0002 WE PROTECTED THE POOR NATICOKE WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUALS AND ALAN SYMPATHIZED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES TILL SPRING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE PROMISED A REFORMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OF RENEWAL OF HER AFFECTION
4153-185072-0003 THE INDIANS WERE SOON ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN OFFICER AND THE WAMPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS ARDENTLY WISHED FOR
4153-185072-0004 MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ALLAN'S HORSE AND CARRYING THE GOODS
4153-185072-0005 ALLEYNE ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT OF HIS RETURN THEY WERE SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTLE'S WHO MARRIED PRISCILLA RAMSAY WITH THE SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM
4153-185072-0006 NETTLES AT LENGTH ABANDONED THE CHASE WENT HOME AND ALLEYNE ALL IN TATTERS CAME IN
4153-185072-0007 BY RISING IN THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO RAGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SUFFERING CONDITION ALMOST NAKED
4153-185072-0008 ALLEYNE MADE HIS TROUSERS HIMSELF AND THEN BUILT A RAFT IN WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MONT MORRIS
4153-185072-0009 THERE AN INDIAN GAVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A GOOD GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE BEARDSTOWN WHEN HE FOUND HIS SQUAW
4153-185072-0010 NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THAT PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GALDO
4153-185072-0011 THE LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SOFTNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE TO HIS FORMER CASTLE OF SAFETY
4153-185072-0012 HIS PURSUERS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETED AND UNDER THEIR PROTECTION
4153-185072-0013 STILL UNSATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THEY ADVISED MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME THE SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDERED OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT TO MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF A SITUATION AND FINALLY THEY LEFT ME
4153-185072-0014 HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOKE ME WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION FEARING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO MAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN AND IN A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
4153-185072-0015 AT THE TIME ALLAN LAY IN A SECRET PLACE IN THE GULF A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FLATS IN A HOLE THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER
4153-186222-0000 THERE IS LITTLE DANGER IN THIS QUARTER I'M SURE SO I MAY AS WELL BE FRIENDS WITH THIS POOR CHILD
4153-186222-0001 AH WHAT NOT
4153-186222-0002 BEETH HESITATED
4153-186222-0003 A LETTER ASKING ME TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAD EVER RECEIVED FROM HER
4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE SHE HAD ASKED ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FRIENDLY AND SO I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
4153-186222-0005 SURELY TWO GIRLS WILL HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS LONELY LITTLE PLACE THAN ONE COULD HAVE ALONE
4153-186222-0006 OH OH YES SHE HAS CORRECTED LOUISE
4153-186222-0007 YOU MEAN PATRICIA DOYLE THERE
4153-186222-0008 THEN WE MAY CONCLUDE SHE'S LEFT OUT OF THAT ARRANGEMENT SAID BETH CALMLY
4153-186222-0009 WE'LL FIGHT FOR YOUR OWN CHANCE AND FIGHT MIGHTY HARD
4153-186222-0010 WELL MY DEAR COUSIN I DON'T WANT AUNT JANE'S MONEY
4153-186222-0011 MY MOTHER AND I ARE AMPLY PROVIDED FOR AND I'M ONLY HERE TO FIND REST FOR MY SOCIAL DUTIES AND TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH MY DEAD FATHER'S SISTER THAT IS ALL
4153-186222-0012 MY FATHER TEACHES MUSIC AND MOTHER SCOLDS HIM PARTICULARLY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT
4153-186222-0013 YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A CENT OF HER MONEY ALTHOUGH FATHER HAS TRIED AT TIMES TO BORROW ENOUGH TO HELP HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
4153-186222-0014 I EVEN KISSED HER WHEN SHE ASKED ME TO AND IT SENT THE SHIVER ALL DOWN MY BACK
4153-186222-0015 FOR MY PART I AM FOND OF ANY ONE AND IT DELIGHTS ME TO FUSS AROUND INVALIDS AND ASSIST THEM
4153-186222-0016 YOU SAY YOU'D LIKE TO CARE FOR IN MILLARD'S AND I DON'T
4153-186222-0017 YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME THINK YOU DON'T WANT ELMHURST THEN YOU'RE AS ANXIOUS TO GET IT AS I AM
4153-186222-0018 THEY CALL ME BETH SULLENY
4153-186222-0019 I COULDN'T LIVE IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE WORLD YOU KNEW
4153-186222-0020 BUT SUPPOSE SHE LEAVES IT TO YOU PERSISTED DOT
4153-186222-0021 LOUISE APPEARED TO MEDITATE
4153-186222-0022 IT'S A MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID BETH LOOKING AT HER COUSINS DOUBTFULLY
4153-186222-0023 AND NOW SHALL WE BE FRIENDS SHE ASKED LIGHTLY
4153-186222-0024 TO BE SURE I WOULD WANT YOU TO MY DEAR
4153-186222-0025 SUCH A GIRL FRIEND IT HAD NEVER BEEN HER PRIVILEGE TO HAVE BEFORE AND WHEN HER SUSPICIONS WERE FORGOTTEN SHE BECAME GREATLY RESPONSIVE AND BRIGHTENED WONDERFULLY
4153-186222-0026 SILAS SHE SAID WHEN HE ENTERED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOUR NIECES
4153-186222-0027 THEY ARE VERY CHARMING GIRLS HE ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THEY ARE AT THE AGE WHEN FEW GIRLS SHOW TO GOOD ADVANTAGE
4153-186222-0028 WHY DID YOU NOT INVITE KENNETS TO DINNER JANE THE BOY
4153-186222-0029 HE IS CONSEQUENTLY SAYING DISAGREEABLE THINGS
4153-186222-0030 VERY WELL SAID THE LAWYER QUIETLY WHICH OF MY NIECE DO YOU PREFER
4153-186222-0031 ASKED THE OLD LADY AFTER A PAUSE I CANNOT SAY ON SO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE HE ANSWERED WITH GRAVITY THAT DO YOU PREFER JANE
4153-186222-0032 THEY ARE EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY SHE ADDED
4153-186222-0033 I CANNOT IMAGINE ELMHURSTS BELONGING TO EITHER SILAS
4153-186222-0034 I MUST SEE THAT OTHER POLICE THE ONE WHO DEFIES ME AND REFUSES TO ANSWER MY SECOND LETTER
4153-186222-0035 THERE WOULD BE A DOZEN HAIRS TO FIGHT FOR MY MONEY AND DEAR OLD ELMHURST WOULD BE SOLD TO STRANGERS SHE RESUMED WITH BITTERNESS
4153-186223-0000 IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE ROOM KENNETH FORBES SQUATTED UPON A BENCH WITH AN EMPTY PINE BOX HELD CARELESSLY ON HIS LAP
4153-186223-0001 WHILE DUNCAN WATCHED THE BOY WAS BUSY WITH HIS PENCIL BUT NEITHER HAD SPOKEN FOR AT LEAST A HALF HOUR
4153-186223-0002 THEN RIDING SLOWLY ON THE HEDGE BORDERED ROAD HIS TROUBLES ONCE MORE ASSAILED HIM AND HE WONDERED IF THERE WAS NOT SOME SPOT UPON THE BROAD EARTH TO WHICH HE COULD FLY FOR RETIREMENT UNTIL THE GIRLS HAD LEFT ELMHURST FOR GOOD
4153-186223-0003 NORAH SHIED AND HE LOOKED UP TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAD NEARLY RUN DOWN A PEDESTRIAN THE STOUT LITTLE MAN WITH A BUNDLE UNDER HIS ARM WHO HELD UP ONE HAND AS IF TO ARREST HIM
4153-186223-0004 WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO ASKED THE WIFE
4153-186223-0005 THEN IT'S THE SAME JANE AS EVER HE RESPONDED WITH A SHAKE OF GRIZZLED HEAD
4153-186223-0006 D'YOU KNOW I THOUGHT O HOPED SHE'D REFORMED AND I'D BE GLAD TO SEE HER AGAIN THEY TELL ME SHE'S GOT MONEY
4153-186223-0007 UNCLE JANE'S RICH AUNT JANE
4153-186223-0008 ECHOED THE MAN QUICKLY WHAT YOU THINK LAD
4153-186223-0009 DON'T LIKE GIRLS TO THINK IT
4153-186223-0010 ANOTHER LONG PAUSE THEN THE BOY SUDDENLY TURNING QUESTIONER
4153-186223-0011 YOU KNOW AH MISS MERRICK SIR
4153-186223-0012 I USED TO WHEN WE WERE BOTH OLDER
4153-186223-0013 KENNETH STOPPED SHORT AND THE MAYOR STOPPED THE LITTLE MAN WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT ALSO STOPPED
4153-186223-0014 JOHN MERRICK'S ME
4153-186223-0015 YOU'RE A TINSMITH
4153-186223-0016 THEY KEPT TRACK OF HER BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY BECAME RICH AND A GREAT LADY AND THAT WAS A SURPRISING THING TO HAPPEN TO UMERRICK
4153-186223-0017 THANK YOU LAD RETURNED THE MAN GRATEFULLY I THOUGHT A LITTLE EXERCISE WOULD DO ME GOOD BUT THAT THREE MILES HAS SEEMED LIKE THIRTY TO ME
4153-186223-0018 I SAID THE MAN
4153-186223-0019 THE BOY MOVED AWAY BUT IN A MOMENT HALTED AGAIN
4153-186223-0020 HIS INTEREST IN MISS JANE'S FATHER JOHN WAS EXTRAORDINARY
4153-61735-0000 THEY ARE BUT LUKEWARM LOVERS WHO CAN CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THE DIALOGUE CARRIED ON AT BEAUHOT DISTANCE
4153-61735-0001 IF THERE BE AN ELYSIUM IN EARTH IT IS THIS
4153-61735-0002 HIS OWN DAUGHTER HIS ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE BEST BLOOD OF SOUTHERN ARISTOCRACY BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING TO SECURE HIM THE SPLENDID ALLIANCE HOLDING KNIGHTLY ASSIGNATION WITH A HORSE HUNTER
4153-61735-0003 HE WOULD WELL CONCEDE SO MUCH TO HER CAPRICE SINCE HER STAYING AT HOME COULD BE NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE CAUSE THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO THE STERN COUNCIL
4153-61735-0004 IT IS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THIS ROAD PASSED THE HACIENDA OF THE CASA DEL CORVO AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER
4153-61735-0005 ON REACHING THE COPSE HE DISMOUNTED LED HIS HORSE IN AMONG THE UNDERWOOD HITCHED HIM BY LOOPING HIS BRIDLE REIN AROUND THE TOPMOST TWIGS OF AN ELASTIC BOW THEN DETACHING A LONG ROPE OF TWISTED HORSE HAIR FROM THE HORN OF HIS SADDLE AND INSERTING HIS ARMS INTO ITS COIL HE GLIDED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND ON THAT SIDE THAT LAY TOWARDS THE HACIENDA
4153-61735-0006 BEFORE FORSAKING THE SHADOW OF THE CORPSE HE CAST A GLANCE AT THE SKY AND AT THE MOON SAILING SUPREMELY OVER IT
4153-61735-0007 THE DROLL CONCEIT WHICH HAS SO OFT AMUSED THE NOCTURNAL INEBRIATES OF GREAT CITIES APPEARED TO PRODUCE A LIKE EFFECT UPON THE NIGHT PATROLLER OF THE PRAIRIE AND FOR A MOMENT THE SHADOW LATE DARKENING HIS BROW DISAPPEARED
4153-61735-0008 IT'S NOT LIKELY IF THINGS ARE UNLESS IT BE THE OWNER OF A BAD CONSCIENCE WHO CAN'T SLEEP
4153-61735-0009 TROTH THERE'S ONE JUST WITHIN THOSE WALLS
4153-61735-0010 IF HE BE ABROAD THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF HIS SEEING ME ON THE OPEN GROUND NOT THAT I SHOULD CARE A STRAW IF IT WERE ONLY HIMSELF TO BE COMPROMISED
4153-61735-0011 IT'S NO USE WAITING UPON THE MOON DEUCECARE
4153-61735-0012 IT IS TRUE HE HAD DESIGNS UPON THE HACIENDA BUT THESE DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EITHER ITS CACHE PLATE OR JEWELLERY IF WE ACCEPT THE MOST PRECIOUS JEWEL IT CONTAINED THE MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HERSELF
4323-13259-0000 THE CHURCH BELLS WERE RINGING AND PEOPLE ON THE AVENUE GOING BACK TO SERVICE TURNED CURIOUS INQUIRING LOOKS UP AT THE GREAT HOUSE AND THEN WENT ON TALKING OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD SO STRANGELY ENTERED INTO AND MADE HISTORY IN THE CITY
4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSIONED APPEAL THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMOND WAS VOTED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SALOON
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAYMOND STOOD CONDEMNED BY THE REST
4323-13259-0004 SO THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT IN RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULED
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM BRIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST AND GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 WHAT IF HE HAD COME TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 WHEN HAD THAT FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS
4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICES UNDISTURBED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG IN THEIR SURFACE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WELLS OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKY POWER IN RAIMENT THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOREVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE A FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEETINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON AND HIS AWFUL CURSE
4323-13259-0013 GRAY AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRERS WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT NOREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO IN PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 GRAY HAD GONE OUT TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER AND MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERALS SAID GREY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW NOREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOUR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PAGE THINK BEST WILL BE ALL RIGHT
4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DESPAIR AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND ON HIS WAY TO THE EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN A NEIGHBORING CITY
4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES OF THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OR THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONVENTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD MAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTRE OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION WAS FULL OF SALOONS
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE CLEAR PART OF THIS STRANGE SERVICE
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS EVER WITNESSED
4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A DOZEN OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY
4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS PHRONSIE TURNED FREELY AWAY
4323-18416-0001 I'LL TRY AND SHE LAY A QUICK HAND ON THE KNOB
4323-18416-0002 TWO RED SPOTS BURNED ON HER CHEEKS AND HER BIG BLUE EYES SNAPPED
4323-18416-0003 NOW I'M SURE I HEARD IT RAGING UP AND DOWN
4323-18416-0004 I DON'T WANT ANY DINNER SAID CHARLOTTE DRIVING BACK
4323-18416-0005 YES INDEED SAID POLLY CHEERILY JUST AS FINE AS MAY BE
4323-18416-0006 ASSUREDLY SAID OLD MISTER KING WITH GREAT SATISFACTION IN BILLY'S PLEASURE AND AT HER SUCCESS IN DRAWING CHARLOTTE OUT
4323-18416-0007 THEN AFTER THIS THERE WERE NO MORE QUIET DAYS FOR CHARLOTTE CHATTERTON
4323-18416-0008 OH BLESS ME IT'S YOU PHRONSIE SAID PLEASED SURPRISE
4323-18416-0009 YES GRANDPAPA SAYS PHRONSIE COMING IN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR CAREFULLY I CAME ON PURPOSE TO SEE YOU ALL ALONE
4323-18416-0010 SO YOU DID MY DEAR SAID MISTER KING HIGHLY GRATIFIED AND PUSHING AWAY HIS WRITING TABLE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
4323-18416-0011 OH NO GRANDPAPA CRIED PHRONSIE IN A RAPTURE I SHOULD NEVER BE TOO BIG FOR THAT SO SHE PERCHED UP AS OF OLD ON HIS KNEE THEN SHE FOLDED HER HANDS AND LOOKED GRAVELY IN HIS FACE
4323-18416-0012 WELL MY DEAR WHERE IS IT
4323-18416-0013 ASKED THE OLD GENTLEMEN PRESENTLY YOU'VE COME TO TELL ME SOMETHING I SUPPOSE
4323-18416-0014 YES GRANDPAPA I HAVE SAID PHRONSIE DECIDEDLY AND IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TOO GRANDPAPA AND OH I DO WISH IT SO MUCH AND SHE CLASPED HER HANDS TIGHTLY AND SIGHED
4323-18416-0015 WELL NOW PHRONSIE IF YOU WANT IT I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE SAID MISTER KING QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
4323-18416-0016 OR SHE LEFT YOU EVERYTHING SHE HAD PHRONSIE A COUPLE OF MILLIONS OR SO IT IS WHY
4323-18416-0017 CHARLOTTE POOR REPEATED THE OLD GENTLEMEN

4323-18416-0019 GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE WASN'T MISSUS CHATTERTON AUNT TO SCARLET
4323-18416-0020 IF MISSUS CHATTERTON WAS AUNT OF CHARLOTTE PERSISTED PHRONSIE SLOWLY IT SEEMS AS IF CHARLOTTE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF THE MONEY IT REALLY DOES GRANDPAPA
4323-18416-0021 MAYBE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A SHORT LAUGH AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF COUSIN ENICE WAS SORRY OVER A FEW OTHER THINGS TOO PHRONSIE
4323-18416-0022 WOULDN'T IT MADE HER VERY GLAD IF I GAVE CHARLOTTE SOME OF THE MONEY
4323-18416-0023 FOR ANSWER MISTER KING SET HER DOWN HEAVILY ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK TWO OR THREE TURNS UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
4323-18416-0024 OH I DO SO WISH I MIGHT SHE SAID THERES SO MUCH FOR A LITTLE GIRL LIKE ME
4323-18416-0025 IT WOULD BE SO NICE TO HAVE CHARLOTTE HAVE SOME WITH ME AND STILL NO ANSWER
4323-18416-0026 I WAS WRITING A NOTE TO MISSUS FARGOT SAID PHRONSIE PUTTING UP HER LIPS FOR A KISS
4323-18416-0027 SURE AS YOU CAN BE PHRONSIE SAID OLD MISTER KING SMILING GOOD BYE DEAR
4323-18416-0028 THERE THERE MY SISTER'S BROTHER SHALL NEVER SAY THAT BUT COME IN COME IN
4323-18416-0029 NOR TO BE UNGRACIOUS THE YOUNG MAN THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR
4323-18416-0030 OH HANG IT UNCLE WHY CAN'T YOU LEAVE ME ALONE
4323-18416-0031 WHICH'S A WONDER INTERPOLATED PICKERING
4323-18416-0032 I KNOW YOU DID UNCLE SAID PICKERING WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT'S GOOD
4323-18416-0033 FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE PICKERING CRIED HIS UNCLE DARTING IN FRONT OF THE CHAIR AND HIS RESTLESS OCCUPANT DON'T SAY THAT AGAIN
4323-18416-0034 I'VE BEEN A LAZY DOG ALL MY LIFE AND GOOD FOR NOUGHT AND I HOPE I'VE NOT SUNK TO THAT
4323-55228-0000 THE NEXT MOMENT HE FELL BACK IN AMAZEMENT BEFORE THE IMPETUOUS RUSH OF A STARRY EYED FLUSHING CHEEKED YOUNG WOMAN WHO DEMANDED
4323-55228-0001 WHERE IS HE PETE MISS BABY GASPED THE OLD MAN
4323-55228-0002 AUNT HANNAH'S CHEEKS TOO WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES STARRY BUT WITH DISMAY AND ANGER THIS LAST BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PETE HAD SAID MISS BILLY'S NAME
4323-55228-0003 IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO IT OF COURSE'S SHE
4323-55228-0004 RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY BUT IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE IS HE
4323-55228-0005 INTERPOSED KITTY TELL MISTER BERTRAM I AM HERE OR WAIT I'LL GO RIGHT IN AND SURPRISE HIM
4323-55228-0006 PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE ACROSS AUNT HANNAH
4323-55228-0007 MISS BILLY MISS BILLY YOU'RE A ANGEL STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN YOU ARE YOU ARE OH I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME
4323-55228-0008 IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT HE'S IN THE DEN MISS EMILY
4323-55228-0009 BILLY TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD TAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARD A DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AUNT HANNAH'S INDIGNANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BILLY STOP
4323-55228-0010 PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIP TWITCHED
4323-55228-0011 BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE AND HE SPOKE
4323-55228-0012 A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON HER KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN
4323-55228-0013 DONCLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY
4323-55228-0014 IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GRAVE LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE
4323-55228-0015 THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINING IN IT ALL
4323-55228-0016 AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER IN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USABLE
4323-55228-0017 WHY OF COURSE STAMMERED BILLY I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAY BE YOU HAD FOUND OUT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
4323-55228-0018 DEMANDED BERTRAM LAUGHING AND MYSTIFIED
4323-55228-0019 AS FOR YOUR NOT PAINTING AGAIN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE DEARIE
4323-55228-0020 HE PULLED HERSELF HALF AWAY FROM BERTRAM'S ENCIRCLING ARM
4323-55228-0021 BILLY GAVE A QUIVERING SIGH
4323-55228-0022 GOOD HEAVENS IS KATE IN HIS TOO BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS SAVAGE NOW
4323-55228-0023 WELL I WROTE A LETTER
4323-55228-0024 BILL LAUGHED GAYLY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES
4323-55228-0025 AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILL THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM
4323-55228-0026 HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MAKE THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS
4323-55228-0027 BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION IN HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT'S
4323-55228-0028 AFTER A MINUTE HE STIRRED AND SIGHED HAPPILY
4323-55228-0029 AND YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARKWRIGHT
4323-55228-0030 AND AND YOU DIDN'T CARE SPECIALLY FOR TO MISS WINTHROP
4323-55228-0031 BILLY PUT HIS SOFT FINGER ON HIS LIPS
4323-55228-0032 BERTRAM KISSED THE WINDOW AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED
4323-55228-0033 WELL WHAT IS THAT IS THAT KIT TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY
4323-55228-0034 THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERTRAM SIGHED
4323-55228-0035 BILLY I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANSWERED DECISIVELY
4323-55228-0036 I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL THEN YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING WHICH WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY
4323-55228-0037 I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW I'D GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUND THAT LAW I FORGOT
4323-55228-0038 FIVE DAYS INDEED SO
4323-55228-0039 I WONDER IF YOU THINK I CAN GET READY TO BE MARRIED ON FIVE DAYS
4323-55228-0040 DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF
4323-55228-0041 IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE IT
4323-55228-0042 BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERRAM CRAFTILY
4323-55228-0043 THAT TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT
4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS OWN LEFT ARM
4323-55228-0045 BILLY MY LORD
4323-55228-0046 IT IS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER
4323-55228-0047 SHE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU
4323-55228-0048 YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE DOCTOR
4323-55228-0049 AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE ANOTHER UNCERTAINLY
4323-55228-0050 YES NODDED EMILY DEMURELY
4323-55228-0051 OH YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM MERRILY
4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT UPON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW
4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE THING WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MIGHT NOW FULFIL
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM MORE IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SAILORD DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT
4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORKING HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK
4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS THE FATE'S INSTRUMENT
4515-11057-0006 THEY WROTE TO MARIAN
4515-11057-0007 WILL YOU LET ME ENTER OR COME AND SEE ME
4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF VIFFIN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OFF THERE
4515-11057-0010 I HOPED YE WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
4515-11057-0011 POVERTY I CANNOT ONLY SUPPOSE
4515-11057-0012 BUT I WILL SEE WHELP DALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFIN FOR A LONG TIME
4515-11057-0013 WAS HE STILL SO VERY SMALL
4515-11057-0014 ASKED AMAY COMPASSIONATELY
4515-11057-0015 I'M AFRAID TOO HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY
4515-11057-0016 OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO SOME HOPELESS LOVE
4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW IT ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
4515-11057-0020 AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMAN
4515-11057-0021 ESPECIALLY NOW THAT A FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
4515-11057-0022 IS IT TOO SERIOUS
4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
4515-11057-0024 THE DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT
4515-11057-0025 HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FILL DESPONDENTLY
4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY CHANGE
4515-11057-0027 THERE WAS VIOLENCE
4515-11057-0028 THE LAST FOUR YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
4515-11057-0029 RECALL HOW I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME
4515-11057-0030 JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF THE LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT
4515-11057-0031 YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN MY WALK RECENTLY
4515-11057-0032 DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE PRESENT AND SO ON GENERALLY
4515-11057-0033 SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU THEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
4515-11057-0034 HIS STORY IN THAT GIRL'S PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
4515-11057-0035 AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT IT AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
4515-11057-0036 I SURMISE NOW THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
4515-11057-0037 DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH A IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED
4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS IS PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT CAN I DO
4515-11057-0039 THE CASE IS TOO DIFFICULT I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE
4515-11057-0040 WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRABBLING
4515-11057-0041 AGAIN JASPER HELD THE HOT SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT
4515-11057-0042 YET TO SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY
4515-11057-0043 MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON THE COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE AROSE WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER HEART
4515-11057-0045 HE WENT ABRUPTLY
4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN HE ADDED
4515-11057-0047 THEN ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE BATTLE
4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN WHY
4515-11057-0049 YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR OWN WAY JASPER
4515-11057-0050 MORE OF A BRUTE HE MEAN
4515-11057-0051 YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT I DON'T
4515-11057-0052 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON
4515-11057-0053 MISS
4515-11057-0054 SHALL YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE
4515-11057-0055 YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR POWER AT PRESENT
4515-11057-0056 BUT I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER
4515-11057-0057 SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM CATCHINGLY
4515-11057-0058 OH I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND
4515-11057-0059 HAS ONE THING DECLARED TO YOU
4515-11057-0060 WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FOR A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN
4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES THAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM
4515-11057-0062 THEY LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED
4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER OUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU WERE MY WIFE
4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT VIRGINIA AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
4515-11057-0065 GET JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT
4515-11057-0066 BUT YOU THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE
4515-11057-0067 THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH
4515-11057-0068 I DON'T ASK MYSELF
4515-11057-0069 THEN SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILLINGLY
4515-11057-0070 PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MADAM
4515-11057-0071 WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL THE LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK MEANS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME
4515-11057-0073 WHY NEED HE CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0074 WAS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUST YOURSELF
4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MONSIEUR
4515-11057-0076 NOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS
4515-11057-0077 I CANNOT WISH IT
4515-11057-0078 HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM AND HIS FACE TREMBLED
4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING WITH HER PARENTS
4515-11057-0080 AND YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME
4515-11057-0081 IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY CHILD
4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIANNE I CAN'T STAND IT
4515-11057-0083 I WILL BE GRATEFUL TO YOU
4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENSE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARION TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
4515-11057-0085 MOVING TO FOLLOW THEY SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING
4515-11057-0086 IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE FOOLISHNESS
4515-11057-0087 BUT I CAN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
4515-11057-0088 YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT IS AN END OF EVERYTHING
4515-11057-0089 HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY THOUGHT
4515-11057-0090 IS IT NOT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
4515-11057-0091 BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THEN I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
4515-11057-0092 IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE IT I DID LOVE YOU
4515-11057-0093 WHAT YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW
4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND KEEP HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO
4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH SHE WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT
4515-11057-0096 WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THAT TRUTH
4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR A WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WOULD YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME
4515-11057-0099 NO THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL DUST
4515-11057-0101 JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ADDED CALMLY
4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM SIR
4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARION YOU CAN'T WORK
4515-11057-0104 I MIGHT AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
4515-11057-0105 GOOD BY I SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
4515-11057-0106 THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIANA LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAS THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED THE GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TONES AND ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW MINUTES AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
4515-11057-0110 SATURDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOU ARE THE ONLY SON I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 AND SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELLING ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF A CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DISTINCT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MORE DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDERS WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY ON SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LIFE
4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTION FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTIONS THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT APPOINTEE TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE COLONEL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOXHOUND IS VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A POSSIBLE HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOR IT WAS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 BUT PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ADMITTED TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT AND THE BIGGER HOUND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON ITS LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SUN OR OTTER HOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BRED BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HARRIER AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBOROUGH HOUND SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR HIM
4570-14911-0008 THEN THEY SEEMED TO BRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY
4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHASTONS THE HOWSTEAD PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HOLTONS THE LEE PARK THE STOKEPLACE THE SEDINBURGH THE SURBITON THE TRINITY FOOT THE WOOD DALE MISSUS G W HILLIARDS MISSUS PRICE'S AND MISSUS TURNER'S
4570-14911-0010 EYES BROWN DARK HAZEL OR HAZEL NOT DEEP SET NOR BULGY AND HAD A MILD EXPRESSION
4570-14911-0011 THE EARS LONG SET ON LOW FINE IN TEXTURE AND HANGING IN A GRACEFUL FOLD CLOSE TO THE CHEEK

4831-25894-0033 LITTLE RONZO WAS ACCEPTED WITH DELIGHT BY THE KIND LADY AND HER CHILDREN AND TESSA LEARNED A SONG QUITE EASILY
4831-25894-0034 AROSE FROM THE CROWD OF PEOPLE GATHERED TO THE FESTIVAL
4831-25894-0035 BEFORE THEY WENT HOME THE KIND MASTER TOLD TESSA SHE SHOULD BE HER FRIEND AND GAVE HER A MOTHERLY KISS WHICH WARMED THE CHILD'S HEART AND SEEMED TO SET A SEAL UPON THAT PROMISE
4831-29134-0000 THIS SENATOR TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE PULPIT WITH THE MINISTER ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL ON THE OTHER
4831-29134-0001 SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE PRESENCE OF A LIVING UNITED STATES SENATOR THAT DURING THREE WEEKS NOT A SPITBALL WAS THROWN
4831-29134-0002 AFTER THAT THEY BEGAN TO COME TO THEMSELVES BY DEGREES AND PRESENTLY THE SPELL WAS WHOLLY GONE AND THEY WERE RECITING VERSES AND PULLING
4831-29134-0003 THE USUAL SUNDAY SCHOOL EXERCISES WERE HURRIED THROUGH AND THEN THE MINISTER GOT UP AND BORED THE HOUSE WITH A SPEECH BUILT ON THE CUSTOMARY SUNDAY SCHOOL PLAN AND THEN THE SUPERINTENDENT PUT IN HIS OAR THEN THE TOWN DIGNITARIES HAD THEIR SAY
4831-29134-0004 AM I IN SOME POPULOUS CENTER OF MY OWN COUNTRY WHERE THE CHOICEST CHILDREN OF THE LAND HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND BROUGHT TOGETHER AS AT THE FAIR FOR A PRIZE NO
4831-29134-0005 THEN WHAT AM I YES WHERE AM I
4831-29134-0006 MY LORD IS LOST IN WONDER AT THE THOUGHT
4831-29134-0007 EARTH HAS NO HIGHER NO GRANDER VISION FOR ME
4831-29134-0008 WELL WHAT IS IT WHAT DID MY CONSCIOUSNESS REPLY
4831-29134-0009 AH THINK OF THAT NOW I COULD HARDLY KEEP THE TEARS BACK I WAS SO FEARFUL
4831-29134-0010 THEY COULD NOT GIVE HIM A COSTLY EDUCATION BUT THEY WERE GOOD AND WISE AND THEY SENT HIM TO THIS SUNDAY SCHOOL HE LOVED THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
4831-29134-0011 I HOPE YOU LOVE YOUR SUNDAY SCHOOL AYE SEE BY YOUR FACES THAT YOU DO IS RIGHT
4831-29134-0012 ALWAYS LOVE YOUR TEACHERS MY CHILDREN FOR THEY LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN SAY NOW
4831-29134-0013 AND BY AND BY THE PEOPLE MADE HIM GOVERNOR AND HE SAID IT IS ALL OWING TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
4831-29134-0014 WHY THE PEOPLE GAVE HIM A TOWERING ILLUSTRIOUS POSITION A GRAVE IMPOSING POSITION
4831-29134-0015 IT WAS SUNDAY OF THE UNITED STATES
4831-29134-0016 THAT POOR LITTLE BOY THAT LEFT HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT MAN THAT MAN STANDS BEFORE YOU
4831-29134-0017 ABOVE ALL THINGS MY DARLING BE HONEST
4831-29134-0018 WHEN SENATOR DILWORTHY DEPARTED FROM CANALVILLE HE LEFT THREE DOZEN BOYS BEHIND HIM ARRANGING A CAMPAIGN OF LIFE WHOSE OBJECTIVE POINT WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATE
5543-27761-0000 LULET WAS A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
5543-27761-0001 THERE WAS NO OTHER SUCH CHILD THERE NEVER HAD BEEN AN THERE NEVER WOULD BE
5543-27761-0002 LULERCHKA'S MOTHER SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA WAS SURE OF THAT
5543-27761-0003 LUETZKA'S EYES WERE DARK AND LARGE HER CHEEKS WERE ROSY HER LIPS WERE MADE FOR KISSES AND FOR LAUGHTER
5543-27761-0004 BUT IT WAS NOT THESE CHARMS IN LAETCHKA THAT GAVE THE MOTHER THE KEENEST JOY
5543-27761-0005 SHE FELT COLD IN HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0006 HE WAS ALWAYS FRESH AND COOL WITH A FRIGID SMILE AND WHEREVER HE PASSED COLD CURRENTS SEEMED TO MOVE INTO THE AIR
5543-27761-0007 IT EVEN SEEMED TO AS SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER FUTURE HUSBAND AND THIS MADE HER HAPPY
5543-27761-0008 THE BRIDE IS ALSO GOOD LOOKING SHE WAS A TALL DARK EYED DARK HAIRED GIRL SOMEWHAT TIMID BUT VERY TACTFUL
5543-27761-0009 HE HAD CONNECTIONS AND HIS LIFE CAME OF GOOD INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE
5543-27761-0010 THIS MIGHT AT THEIR PROPER OPPORTUNITY PROVE USEFUL
5543-27761-0011 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MANNER OF SERGEY MOLOSTOVITCH TO SUGGEST ANYTHING WRONG TO HIS WIFE
5543-27761-0012 LATER HOWEVER WHEN HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD SERGEY MOTHOVITCH ESTABLISHED CONNECTIONS ELSEWHERE OF A LIGHT AND TEMPORARY NATURE
5543-27761-0013 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA FOUND THIS OUT AND TO HER OWN ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY HURT SHE AWAITED HER INTENT WITH A RESTLESS ANTICIPATION THAT SWALLOWED EVERY OTHER FEELING
5543-27761-0014 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA DRIFTED FURTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM HIM
5543-27761-0015 LUTSHKA THEN RAN AWAY STAMPING WITH HER PLUMP LITTLE LEGS OVER THE CARPETS AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR HER BED
5543-27761-0016 WHERE IS MY BABY GIRL THE MOTHER ASKED AS SHE LOOKED FOR LUALACHKA AND MADE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID NOT SEE HER
5543-27761-0017 THEN SHE CAME OUT A LITTLE FARTHER AND HER MOTHER AS THOUGH SHE HAD ONLY JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SEIZED HER BY HER LITTLE SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED JOYOUSLY HERE SHE IS MY LAELETCHKA
5543-27761-0018 A MOTHER'S EYES GLOWED WITH PASSIONATE EMOTION
5543-27761-0019 HER MOTHER CAME TO HIDE
5543-27761-0020 LULEDCHKA TURNED AWAY AS THOUGH NOT TO SEE BUT WATCHED HER MAMUCHKA STEALTHILY ALL THE TIME
5543-27761-0021 WHERE IS MYMA MOTCHKA ASKED LUETSHKA
5543-27761-0022 A SMILE OF ABSOLUTE BLISS PLAYED ON THEIR RED LIPS
5543-27761-0023 LATCHKA WAS GETTING NEAR HER MOTHER'S CORNER
5543-27761-0024 HER MOTHER WAS GROWING MORE EXHAUSTED EVERY MOMENT BY HER INTEREST IN THE GAME HER HEART BEAT WITH SHORT QUICK STROKES AND SHE PRESSED EVEN CLOSER TO THE WALL DISARRANGING HER HAIR STILL MORE
5543-27761-0025 VALEKKA SUDDENLY GLANCED TOWARD HER MOTHER'S CORNER AND SCREAMED WITH JOY
5543-27761-0026 THROUGH THE HALF OPENED DOORS HE HEARD THE LAUGHTER THE JOYOUS OUTCRIES THE SOUND OF ROMPING
5543-27761-0027 EVEN PHILODOSIA FELT ABASHED NOW FOR HER MISTRESS NOW FOR HERSELF
5543-27761-0028 HE LIKED COMING HERE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED THIS WAS DONE BY SERAFINA ALEXANDROVNA WHO WISHED TO SURROUND HER LITTLE GIRL FROM HER VERY INFANCY ONLY WITH THE LOVELIEST THINGS
5543-27761-0029 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA DRESSED HERSELF TASTEFULLY THIS TOO SHE DID FOR LULETCHKA WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW
5543-27761-0030 ONE THING SERGEY MOOSTOVITCH HAD NOT BECOME RECONCILED TO AND THIS WAS HIS WIFE'S ALMOST CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN THE NURSERY
5543-27761-0031 IT'S JUST AS I THOUGHT I KNEW THAT I'D FIND YOU HE SAID WITH A DERISIVE AND CONDESCENDING SMILE
5543-27761-0032 MERELY YOU SEE THAT THE CHILD SHOULD FEEL ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY HE EXPLAINED IN ANSWER TO SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA'S PUZZLED GLANCES
5543-27761-0033 SHE'S STILL SO LITTLE SAID SARAFIKA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0034 I DON'T INSIST IT'S YOUR CONDITION HERE
5543-27761-0035 I'LL THINK IT OVER HIS WIFE ANSWERED SMILING AS HE DID COLDLY BUT GENTLELY
5543-27761-0036 THEN THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF ANYTHING ELSE
5543-27761-0037 THAT THE MISSUS DOES IT WELL THAT'S ONE THING BUT THAT THE YOUNG LADY DOES IT THAT'S BAD
5543-27761-0038 WHY ASKED FIDOSIO WITH CURIOSITY
5543-27761-0039 THIS EXPRESSION OF CURIOSITY GAVE HER FACE THE LOOK OF A STONE ROUGHLY PAINTED DOLL
5543-27761-0040 YES THAT'S BAD REPEATED AGATHYRO WITH CONVICTION TERRIBLY BAD WELL
5543-27761-0041 IT'S THE TRUTH I'M SAYING REMEMBER MY FRIENDS AGATHEA WENT ON WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE AND SECRECY
5543-27761-0042 WHAT'S THE SUREST SIGN
5543-27761-0043 THE OLD WOMAN HAD INVENTED THIS SIGN QUITE SUDDENLY AND SHE WAS EVIDENTLY VERY PROUD OF IT
5543-27761-0044 MADAME M SHE SAID QUIETLY IN A TREMBLING VOICE
5543-27761-0045 SARAFINO ALEXANDROVNA GAVE A START
5543-27761-0046 FEDOSI'S FACE MADE HER ANXIOUS
5543-27761-0047 WHAT IS IT FEDOSYA SHE ASKED WITH GREAT CONCERN IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH LULLETSKA
5543-27761-0048 NO MADAME SAID FEDOSIA AS SHE GESTICULATED WITH HER HANDS TO REASSURE HER MISTRESS AND MAKE HER SIT DOWN
5543-27761-0049 LUTKA'S ASLEEP MAY GOD BE WITH HER
5543-27761-0050 ONLY I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING YOU SEE LULLOTCHKA IS ALWAYS HIDING HERSELF THAT IS NOT GOOD
5543-27761-0051 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BAD IT IS SAID THEDOSIA AND HER FACE EXPRESSED THE MOST DECIDED CONFIDENCE
5543-27761-0052 I UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF WHAT YE ARE SAYING
5543-27761-0053 YOU SEE MAMMA IT'S A KIND OF OMEN EXPLAINS FEDOSIA ABRUPTLY IN A SHAMEFACED WAY
5543-27761-0054 NONSENSE SAYS SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0055 WHO TOLD YOU ALL THIS ASKED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA IN AN AUSTERE VOICE
5543-27761-0056 WHO EXCLAIMED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA IN IRRITATION AS THOUGH SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HERSELF SOMEHOW FROM THIS SUDDEN ANXIETY
5543-27761-0057 WHAT NONSENSE AS THOUGH LUTCHKO COULD DIE
5543-27761-0058 SHE SAW CLEARLY THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN A CHILD'S QUITE ORDINARY DIVERSION AND THE CONTINUATION OF A CHILD'S LIFE
5543-27761-0059 SHE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT THAT EVENING TO OCCUPY HER MIND WITH OTHER MATTERS BUT HER THOUGHTS TURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO THE FACT THAT LUENCHKA LOVED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0060 WHEN LUTSKA WAS STILL QUITE SMALL AND HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HER NURSE SHE SOMETIMES SITTING IN HER NURSE'S ARMS MADE A SUDDEN ROGUISH GRIMACE AND HID HER LAUGHING FACE ON THE NURSE'S SHOULDER
5543-27761-0061 THEN SHE WOULD LOOK BACK WITH A SLY GLANCE
5543-27761-0062 THOUGH SHE REPROACHED HERSELF AT ONCE FOR THIS UNFOUNDED SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD NOT ENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF LUETSHKA'S FAVOURITE GAME AND SHE TRIED TO DIVERT LUETKA'S ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0063 SHE EAGERLY COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S GREAT WISHES
5543-27761-0064 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA TRIED DESPERATELY TO AMUSE LEETCHKA
5543-27761-0065 PERHAPS THOUGHT SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA SHE IS NOT AS STRONGLY DRAWN TO THIS WORLD AS OTHER CHILDREN WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY MANY THINGS
5543-27761-0066 WHEN THIS IS SO IS IT NOT A SIGN OF ORGANIC WEAKNESS
5543-27761-0067 SRAFINA ALEXANDROVNA HERSELF BEGAN THE GAME ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH SHE PLAYED IT WITH A HEAVY HEART
5543-27761-0068 SHE SUFFERED AS THOUGH COMMITTING AN EVIL DEED WITH FULL CONFIDENCE
5543-27761-0069 IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR SARAFIKA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0070 HER MOTHER COVERED HER WITH A GREY BLANKET
5543-27761-0071 LULLITSHKA DREW HER SWEET LITTLE HANDS FROM UNDER THE BLANKET AND STRETCHED THEM OUT TO EMBRACE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER BENT DOWN
5543-27761-0072 SHE SEEMED SO SMALL AND SO FRAIL UNDER THE BLANKET THAT IT COVERED HER
5543-27761-0073 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA REMAINED STANDING OVER LULETKA'S BED A LONG WHILE AND SHE KEPT LOOKING AT LUETCHKA WITH TENDERNESS AND FEAR
5543-27761-0074 I'M A MOTHER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT HER SHE THOUGHT AS SHE IMAGINED THE VARIOUS ILLS THAT MIGHT BEFALL OLATCHKA
5543-27761-0075 SHE PRAYED ALL THAT NIGHT BUT THE PRAYER DID NOT RELIEVE HER SADNESS
5543-27761-0076 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED LUETTECHKA CAUGHT COLD
5543-27761-0077 THE FEVER CAME UPON HER AT LENGTH
5543-27761-0078 WHEN SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA AWAKENED BY FEDOSYA CAME TO LAELETCHKA AND SAW HER LOOKING SO HOT SO RESTLESS AND SO TORMENTED SHE INSTANTLY RECALLED THE EVIL OMEN AND A HOPELESS DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS
5543-27761-0079 A DOCTOR WAS CALLED AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS WHEN THE INEVITABLE HAPPENED
5543-27761-0080 AND LULEDCHKA GREW FEEBLER FROM HOUR TO HOUR
5543-27761-0081 NOTHING MADE HER SO UNHAPPY AS THE REITERATIONS OF FEDOSYA UTTERED BETWEEN SOBS SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF AROLOCHKA
5543-27761-0082 FEVER WAS CONSUMING LEETCHKA AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND SPOKE IN DELIRIUM
5543-27761-0083 MANY DAYS PASSED TORTURING LIKE A NIGHTMARE
5543-27761-0084 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA HID HER FACE BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR LUETTECHKA'S BED HOW TRAGIC
5543-27761-0085 AWAIT MAMOTCHKA WHISPERED LULLETSHKA
5543-27761-0086 MOMOTSHKA'S WHITE FACE BECAME BLURRED AND EVERYTHING GREW DARK BEFORE LULLETSHKA
5543-27761-0087 SHE REMEMBERED HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0088 SARAFIDA ALEXANDROVNA WAS STANDING BY THE COFFIN AND LOOKING DULLY AT HER DEAD CHILD
5543-27761-0089 SITA MY DEAR DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF SAID SERGEY MOLOSTOVITCH IN A WHISPER
5543-27761-0090 YOU MAY RESIGN YOURSELF TO YOUR FATE
5543-27761-0091 SHE'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE PERSISTED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA HER EYES FIXED ON THE DEAD LITTLE GIRL
5543-27761-0092 SERGEY MORODOVITCH LOOKED ROUND HIM CAUTIOUSLY HE WAS AFRAID OF THE UNSEEMLY AND OF THE RIDICULOUS
5543-27761-0093 SISA DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF HE REPEATED
5543-27761-0094 HE WAS CONFUSED AND ANNOYING
5543-27761-0095 HER FACE REMAINED TRANQUIL AND HER EYES WERE DRY
5543-27761-0096 SHE WENT INTO THE NURSERY AND BEGAN TO WALK ROUND THE ROOM LOOKING INTO THOSE PLACES WHERE LALETCHKA USED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0097 SHE WALKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND BENT NOW AND THEN TO LOOK UNDER THE TABLE OR UNDER THE BED AND KEPT ON REPEATING CHEERFULLY WHERE'S MY LITTLE ONE WHERE IS MY LULETSKA
5543-27761-0098 AFTER SHE HAD WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM ONCE SHE BEGAN TO MAKE HER QUEST ANEW
5543-27761-0099 FEDOSYA MOTIONLESS WITH DEJECTED FACE SAT IN A CORNER AND LOOKED FRIGHTENED AT HER MISTRESS AND SHE SUDDENLY BURST OUT SOBBING AND SHE WAILED LOUDLY
5543-27761-0100 SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LUOTCHKA AN ER ANGELIC LITTLE SOUL
5543-27761-0101 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOUR THERE WAS SEVERAL PEOPLE BETWEEN HER AND LUTCHKA
5543-27761-0102 THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF HEAVINESS IN SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA'S HEAD AS SHE APPROACHED LULLETSKA
5543-27761-0103 WOLLUKA LAY THERE STILL AND PALE AND SMILED PATHETICALLY
5543-27761-0104 MY LITTLE ONE DID NOT REPLY
5543-27761-0105 SARAFIA ALEXANDROVNA STOOD UP ERECT SIGHED IN A LOST WAY SMILED AND CALLED LOUDLY LUETCHKA
5543-27761-0106 LUTCHKA IS BEING CARRIED OUT
5849-50873-0000 CAP'N BILL THE COMMANDER OF A SMALL GARRISON AT SEBROOK PERMITTED HIM TO LAND BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO READ HIS COMMISSION BELL ORDERED HIM TO BE SILENT
5849-50873-0001 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MISTER PRINCE WADSWORTH ASKED FOR HE COULD SEE THAT THE MAN WAS GREATLY EXCITED GOVERNOR ANDROSE HAS COME AGAIN GASPED MISTER PRINCE WHY SHOULD THEY ALARM US THE FELLOW THOUGH GIVEN TO BOASTING IS NOT DANGEROUS OR LIABLE TO PUT HIS THREATS INTO EXECUTION BUT HE HAS GROWN DANGEROUS DECLARED MISTER PRINCE THE LIBERTIES OF THE COLONY ARE INVOLVED
5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WANDSWORTH BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY THOUGH HE WAS STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THE MATTER LIGHTLY
5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR PUBLIC RIGHTS
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VICROI HAS COME TO HARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD DECLARED HE SHALL HAVE IT
5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE OTHERS WERE ENGAGED IN A HEATED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO REPEAT THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THAT THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED
5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY BEING ENGAGED IN A DEBATE
5849-50873-0010 THEN WILL HE WAIT UNTIL IT IS ENDED HE HAS PROMISED TO DO SO
5849-50873-0011 MISTER PRINCE FIXED HIS AMAZING EYES ON THE CAPTAIN'S FACE AND READ THERE A DESPERATE DETERMINATION CAPTAIN HE BEGAN
5849-50873-0012 MISTER PRINCE BOWED AND HASTILY RETURNED INTO THE HOUSE WHERE THE ASSEMBLY WAS IN SESSION
5849-50873-0013 AS SOON AS IT WAS GONE CHARLES STEVENS SAID
5849-50873-0014 YES CHARLES YE WILL ANSWER WHAT DO YOU MEAN UNCLE
5849-50873-0015 NEVER DID DEBATERS TAKE FURTHER INTEREST IN A MINOR SUBJECT
5849-50873-0016 WHAT DO YOU INTEND DOING UNTIL WILL YOU FIGHT THEM
5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT ON THE TIME NOT TOO SOON NOR TOO LATE
5849-50873-0018 THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE CABIN SAID
5849-50873-0019 COME GEORGE LET US HASTEN TO THE ASSEMBLY
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR MISSION
5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PLACE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN NODSWORTH
5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT AS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING FRESH ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE IN EACH SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW THE MAN STATIONED NEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH A WINDOW A FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 IT FOLLOWED HIM AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSE BEHIND HER AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED HIS ARM
5849-50873-0028 I HAVE A CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN THE CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WADSWORTH THE TRAIN VANISHED CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 WHERE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HAVE THE TRAIN BANDS IN CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
5849-50873-0032 WHO OF YOU HAS THE BARTER
5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY CALLED THE ENRAGED GOVERNOR
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION SHOOK THEIR HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE DO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVE IN CONNECTICUT WHERE DOES SHE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL ASSISTANT DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THIS OLD TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS GIVEN WAS EVER AFTERWARDS KNOWN AS THE CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER FOR THE SEIZURE OF THE CHARTERS WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN THE ASSEMBLY AT RHODE ISLAND SENT A MOST LOYAL ADDRESS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMALLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE FORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENSE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THEIR DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THEIR FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTER TO THE EXPULSION OF ANDROZ
5849-50962-0000 CALLED BERT WHO HAS HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE

5849-50962-0006 AH I SEE SAID BERT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BUOY WILL GO OUT ON A PULLEY
5849-50962-0007 IT WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MUCH OF THIS WICKED STORM HAD PASSED

5849-50962-0009 MISSUS BOBBSEY MISSUS MINTURN NELLIE AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND NAN WERE ALL THERE FLOSSIE AND FREDDY BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINAH AND SUSAN
5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND BERT AND HAL TRYING TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BUOY WAS WAITING
5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER IT CAME NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND PEOPLE WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFEGUARDS AND A MAN IN THE CORK BELT BANDED TO SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND NELLIE WITH A STRANGE FACE AND THE STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT'S MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FALLING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DROWNED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE DID NOT BELIEVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD

5849-50962-0022 I'D DECLARE WE DID LAND ON A FRIENDLY SHORE
5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BINGHAM SAID THE LIFE SAVING WORK TURNED OUT TO BE A SOCIAL EFFORT FOR THERE WAS A GREAT TIME GREETING NELLIE'S FATHER AND HAL'S UNCLE
5849-50962-0024 BUT HAL AND HIS FATHER TOO PUT IN NAN
5849-50962-0025 WHAT A MORNING THAT WAS AS SUNSET BEACH
5849-50962-0026 I'M SO GLAD WE PRAYED SAID LITTLE FLOSSIE TO FREDDIE WHEN SHE HEARD THE NEWS
5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THE DREADFUL MORNING
5849-50963-0001 AND EVERYBODY WAS VERY HAPPY
5849-50963-0002 THE NEPTUNE THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SAND BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROWBOATS BACK AND FORWARD TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF HER CREW TOOK A FEVER
5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT DELAYED US SIR
5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD ANOTHER LOG LOADED ON THE SCHOONER AND WE STARTED OFF
5849-50963-0006 WE COUNTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WINTER WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE ASKED MISTER BOBBSEY WHO WAS NOW FROM THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 THE FELLOW REPEATED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 WELL I'M A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE MC GLAUGHLAN FOR THE WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US A LIFETIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED ON THIS YEAR
5849-50963-0011 MAYBE AUNT ANNIE WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOPPING TOUR SUGGESTED NAN
5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERKS REMOVE ALL THE TRUCKS FROM THE AISLES AND I GUESS I WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN
5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FACED AND THE MOST ACCURATE MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BYE TO YOU NELLIE HAD TOLD DOROTHY AND NAN NEXT MORNING
5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE PLEASANT DECLARED NAN
5849-50964-0002 YOU ARE TOO RICH NOW AREN'T YOU REMARKED DOROTHY
5849-50964-0003 AND DOROTHY WENT UP AND DOWN HER ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S PROUD SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND WE SHALL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DOROTHY
5849-50964-0005 COME NELLIE CALLED MISSUS MC GLAUGHLAND I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAT
5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NELLIE TOLD ME
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE US FROM HIS ENGINE HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MOST OF EM I GUESS ASKED BERT
5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE A GOOD VACATION AND I'M WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
5849-50964-0010 SO AM I REPLIED NAN VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE PARTY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FREDDY AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISHING NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT
5849-50964-0013 AND SO MY LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION
6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FLY IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD SUCH VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF NATURE
6123-59150-0003 CERTAINLY THAT LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 HE NEED NOT BE A CRUEL AUTHOR
6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN EXISTENCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LAWS IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DEPRIVED THE SCENE OF NEKHLUDOFF IN RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIED SOME ONE IN THE IDIAS
6123-59150-0009 ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF THE ACTION
6123-59150-0010 EVEN YOUR TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SAW ITS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SUCK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN OF HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHILE HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS THIS MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ENNA CARNINA OR FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO OF DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY OR PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTISTE AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AT DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES
6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HUNTING CUTS AND BEARING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE PRUDENT MANIACS
6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT LAUGHED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVE N'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
6123-59150-0024 AND IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLEASURE
6123-59150-0026 DOSTOEVSKI IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFFIEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEOKONSKI AGLEA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VAYA FERUSHENKO NASTASYA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL YVOLGAN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S ABILITY IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ACCEPTS THE DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORDS OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE AND CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY WE ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
6123-59150-0033 SINCE THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 BUT THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORKS THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CE TEVOS
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HOPE THOU MINE UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES A LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MISHKA IN THE IDIOT
6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE THIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
6123-59150-0041 THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MIND
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUGAY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME DECIDED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES THEY CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEYOND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS
6123-59150-0046 HE IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS
6123-59186-0000 HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGINGER
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT NIGHT AND STORM
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GOOD POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL THINGS OR IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THUS HE WRITES ON I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGES IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 THE PROSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORDS DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM ABOUT
6123-59186-0008 THEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 CATERING POWER IS AN APPALLING PHRASE
6123-59186-0010 NOT A LINE OF GOOD POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THEN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YE DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUAL MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUMMIT ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PASSION AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RISE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 OH WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES
6123-59186-0016 MY WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER ON THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THIS SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWING COLD TO ME COULD PLAINLY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY
6123-59186-0020 AND TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HEARTY'S POEMS THE OXEN
6123-59186-0022 WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STORY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THEN TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN
6123-59186-0023 THAT MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOOD
6123-59186-0024 HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONGMEN WHO MARCH AWAY
6123-59186-0025 HOW LONG HE CRIES FOR A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO
6123-59186-0026 WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORNS TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS
6123-59186-0027 BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION AS SENIOR'S SOUL FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE
6123-59186-0028 AND GENERAL HELL HOLD ON OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES
6123-59186-0029 SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND ALL NEW LOVES
6123-59186-0030 AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY STOLE THEY ON OUR DEEDS
6123-59186-0031 MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE IN THE GLORY OF WAR
6123-59186-0032 THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDYE IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE
6123-59186-0033 IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDIS'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE
6123-59186-0034 FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES TO BOTH
6123-59186-0035 HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS ROT IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY
6123-59186-0036 BUT LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH
6123-59186-0037 IN BEYOND THAT LAST LAMP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE
6123-59186-0038 NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUNDS AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON TO YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES
6123-59186-0039 THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER TO OUR OWN
6123-59186-0040 NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DARK HUED DAYS
6267-53049-0000 IT'S A SAD THING FOR A MOTHER TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T IT
6267-53049-0001 PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER THAT SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE AULDER SISTER WISTFULLY
6267-53049-0002 DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT OVER THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY
6267-53049-0003 SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMIRED IT FOR A WORLD
6267-53049-0004 SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO SEEK A NEW DRESS
6267-53049-0005 DORIS HUNTER I BELIEVE IT'S AN OLD QUIRT
6267-53049-0006 LISTEN PENELOPE MY DEAR DORY
6267-53049-0007 LOVE TO PENILOP AND YOURSELF
6267-53049-0008 YOUR AFFECTIONATE LORD ADELA HUNTER
6267-53049-0009 I DON'T KNOW ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A GREAT
6267-53049-0010 THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL FADED NOW
6267-53049-0011 TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF A PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN
6267-53049-0012 IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELA TO SEND THIS SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY
6267-53049-0013 WHY THAT WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PENELOPE
6267-53049-0014 WHAT LOVELY OLD TIME STUFF AND NOT A BIT FATTED
6267-53049-0015 I DECLARE IT BE AS GOOD AS NEW
6267-53049-0016 WELL LET US GO AND HAVE CHEAT SAID PENELOPE I HAVE DECIDEDLY HUNGRY
6267-53049-0017 BESIDES I SEE THAT POVERTY BOCKER COMING
6267-53049-0018 IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSES AND HARE LOOM AFTER ALL
6267-53049-0019 PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT ON HER TRIUMPHANTLY AND THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS A POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET
6267-53049-0020 SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESSES WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE
6267-53049-0021 PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER AMAZING
6267-53049-0022 SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME BEAUTIFUL OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
6267-53049-0023 MY AUNT ADELA GAVE ME GAVE ME THE MATERIAL SHE STAMMERED
6267-53049-0024 I'M NAMED AFTER HIM MISSUS FAIRWATER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVELY OLD FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND TENDERNESS
6267-53049-0025 THEN YOU ARE MY GRAND NIECE SHE SAYS
6267-53049-0026 WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNISE THE ROSEBUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN THIBET
6267-53049-0027 PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE INVITED TO EACH OTHER
6267-53049-0028 SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND HER HOUSE HOLD WAS BROKEN UP
6267-53049-0029 MY DEAR I AM A VERY LONELY OLD WOMEN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME
6267-53049-0030 NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRWOOD'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY
6267-53049-0031 DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS CHANGE IN THE TWINED CLING OF AN EYE
6267-53049-0032 WHEN MISSUS FAIR WEATHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
6267-65525-0000 AS SHE SLIPPED INTO A BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW
6267-65525-0001 AUNT JANE WAS STANDING AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BABY CLANGING TO THE OTHER
6267-65525-0002 SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE TERRIBLE AND VULGAR AS A SUNFLOWER WAS AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS
6267-65525-0003 I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BIGGSBY IS THIS EVENING TIDDY AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK
6267-65525-0004 SYDNEY SIGHED AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE BABY
6267-65525-0005 ALL HIS DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
6267-65525-0006 BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE PROMISED TO WRITE HER LETTER
6267-65525-0007 THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX OVER THE KITCHEN WHICH SYDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS
6267-65525-0008 THEIR BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE
6267-65525-0009 JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A PET AND THE MOUTH ZIG ZAGGED FROM EAR TO EAR
6267-65525-0010 SYDNEY HATED THAT MIRROR AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD HATE ANYBODY
6267-65525-0011 HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SYDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWERY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THE DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID
6267-65525-0012 PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO CRY WITH A FLUSH OF REAL EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE
6267-65525-0013 ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO ELLEN DOUGLAS AND THAT WAS FORWARDED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFFERING EDITOR OF THE MAPLE LEAFS
6267-65525-0014 HE WROTE THAT ALTHOUGH HIS AGE DESPAIRED HIM FROM MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB HE WAS TWENTY AND THE LIMIT WAS EIGHTEEN HE READ THE LETTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH MUCH INTEREST AND OFTEN HAD THOUGHT OF ANSWERING SOME OF THE REQUESTS FOR CORRESPONDENCE
6267-65525-0015 HE NEVER HAD DONE SO BUT ELLEN DOUGLAS'S LETTER WAS SO INTERESTING THAT HE HAD DESIRED TO WRITE TO HER
6267-65525-0016 WOULD HE BE KING ENOUGH TO CORRESPOND WITH HIM
6267-65525-0017 HE WAS TWO YEARS OUT FROM THE EAST AND HAD NOT YET FORGOTTEN TO BE HOME AT TIMES
6267-65525-0018 SYDNEY LIKED THE LETTER AND ASKED IT
6267-65525-0019 SHE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET YOUNG LINCOLN NOR DID SHE WISH TO DO SO
6267-65525-0020 THE CORRESPONDENCE ITSELF SHE FOUND HER PLEASURE
6267-65525-0021 JOHN LINCOLN WROTE BREEZY ACCOUNTS OF RANGE LIFE AND ADVENTURES ON THE FAR WESTERN PLAINS SO ALIEN AND REMOTE FROM SNUG HUMDRUM PLAINFIELD LIFE THAT SYDNEY ALWAYS HAD THE SENSATION OF CROSSING THE GULF WHEN SHE OPENED A LETTER FROM THE BAR AND AS FOR SYDNEY'S OWN LETTER THIS IS THE WAY IT READ AS SHE WROTE IT
6267-65525-0022 THE EVERGREENS PLANTFIELD DEAR MISTER LINCOLN
6267-65525-0023 I LOVE LIFE AND ITS BLOOM AND BRILLIANCY I LOVE MEETING NEW PEOPLE I LIKE THE RIPPLE OF MUSIC THE HUM OF LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION
6267-65525-0024 THE MAN I HAD BEEN TALKING WITH WAS PAUL MOORE THE GRAND NOVELIST
6267-65525-0025 AS IT WAS I HAVE CONTRADICTED HIM TWICE AND HE HAD LAUGHED AND LIKED IT BUT HIS BOOKS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A NEW MEANING TO ME HENCEFORTH THROUGH THE INSIGHT HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN ME
6267-65525-0026 IT IS SUCH MEETINGS AS THESE THAT MAKE LIFE ITS SPARKLE FOR ME
6267-65525-0027 YOU WILL BE WEARY OF MY RHAPSODIES ON HER
6267-65525-0028 SHE HAS SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR MY EVERY WORD
6267-65525-0029 HERS SINCERELY SYDNEY RICHMOND
6267-65525-0030 OLD JANE CAME HOME PRESENTLY AND CARRIED AWAY THE SLEEPING BABY SYDNEY SAID HER PRAYERS WENT TO BED AND SLEPT SOUNDLY AND SERENNILY SHE MAILED HER LETTER THE NEXT DAY AND A MONTH LATER AN ANSWER CAME
6267-65525-0031 SYDNEY DID NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT BUT DOZED RESTLESSLY ABOUT HER CRIED IN HER PILLOW
6267-65525-0032 AND THE GOOD WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD
6267-65525-0033 SYDNEY TROD THE WAYS OF THE TRANSGRESSOR AND FOUND THAT ITS THORNS PURSED TO BONE AND MARROW
6267-65525-0034 YOU'LL SEE THAT ROAD OUT DARK
6267-65525-0035 AND THERE WAS NO HARBOUR OR A GLIMPSE OF DISTANT SEA VISIBLE
6267-65525-0036 HAD THE HALTED KEEPER MADE A MISTAKE
6267-65525-0037 THIS IS HIS PLACE NOBODY CALLS IT A EVERGREEN BUT MYSELF

6467-97061-0001 THEY RUSHED INTO THE ROOM ADDED THEIR CRIES TO HERS AND FORGETTING ALL THEIR FORMER PRECAUTIONS LEFT THE DOORS OPEN SO THAT THE GUARDS OUTSIDE HEARING THAT CLAMOR ENTERED AND SAW THE PRINCE
6467-97061-0002 SHE IS A DISGRACE TO HER FAMILY I SHALL SOON SEE HER HUSBAND IMPALED ON A STAKE
6467-97061-0003 THEN WITH HIS FOREHEAD DISFIGURED BY A FEARFUL FROWN HE CONTINUED TO ABUSE THE PRINCE WHO HAVING TIED HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM DRAGGED HIM FROM THE ROOM
6467-97061-0004 TREATED THUS LIKE SOME WILD BEAST ROUGHLY SHAKEN AND NEGLECTED RAJAHANNA WOULD HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY HAD HE NOT BEEN PROTECTED BY THE MAGIC DUEL GIVEN TO HIM IN PARTHAA AND WHICH HE HAD CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IN HIS HAIR
6467-97061-0005 ADVANCING THEREFORE WITH THE LARGE ARMY HE PREPARED TO BESIEGE CHAMPA THE CAPITAL CITY
6467-97061-0006 A TERRIBLE BATTLE ENSUED IN WHICH BOTH KINGS WERE FORMED PRODIGIES OF VALOUROR
6467-97061-0007 SHOULD THERE BE ANY PITY FOR THE VIOLATOR OF A HAREM
6467-97061-0008 IF THE OLD KING MY FATHER NOW IN HIS STTAGE WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO FAVOR THE CRIMINAL FOR THE SAKE OF HIS WORTHLESS DAUGHTER YOU HAD NO NEED OF HIS PERMISSION AND OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY HIM

6467-97061-0011 WHILE HE STOOD THERE CALMLY AWAITING DEATH WHICH NOW SEEMED INEVITABLE HE SUDDENLY FELT HIS FOOT FREE AND A BEAUTIFUL LADY APPEARED BEFORE HIM
6467-97061-0012 SHE HUMBLY BOWING DOWN SAID LET MY LORD PARDON HIS SERVANT FOR THIS INJURY WHICH SHE HAS UNCONSCIOUSLY CAUSED
6467-97061-0013 I AM AN APSYS BORN FROM THE RAYS OF THE MOON

6467-97061-0017 ON HIS WAY HE SAW THE SILVER FETTLE DESCENDED TO THE GROUND PICKED IT UP AND CONTINUED HIS WATCH
6467-97061-0018 THE SLAYER OF GENDRAVAMA HEARING THIS CAME OUT OF THE PALACE AND QUICKLY MOUNTING THE ELEPHANT WHO HELD DOWN HIS TRUNKS TO RECEIVE HIM PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE PRINCE
6467-97061-0019 GREAT WAS THEIR MUTUAL ASTONISHMENT AND JOY WHEN THEY RECOGNISED EACH OTHER THE PRINCESS EXCLAIMING IS IT POSSIBLE

6467-97061-0021 THROUGH THESE THEY FORCED THEIR WAY EMPLOYING WITH GOOD EFFECTS THE WEAPONS PLACED ON THE ELEPHANT FOR THE USE OF GENDRA
6467-97061-0022 BEFORE HOWEVER THEY HAD GONE FAR THEY HEARD THE NOISE OF A BATTLE AT A DISTANCE AND SAW THE SOLDIERS IN FRONT OF THEM SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS
6467-97061-0023 WE HAD JUST NOW ENCOUNTERED AND UTTERLY DEFEATED THE ENEMY SO THAT THERE IS NO FEAR OF ANY FURTHER RESISTANCE
6467-97061-0024 RAJAMANHAN AGREED TO THIS
6599-38590-0000 WHATEVER HAND IT WAS THAT SHOT DOWN BOURBON ROME AFTER HIS DEATH WAS PLUNDERED DEVASTATED AND RAVAGED BY A CRUEL GREEDY LICENTIOUS AND FANATICAL SOLDIERY

6599-38590-0006 GIVE IT ME ON RETURN AS THOU HAST COME
6599-38590-0007 I AM QUITE UNWILLING SAID THE KING LET HIM HAVE IT
6599-38590-0008 THE PIECE OF CAMBREW WAS CALLED THE LADY'S PIECE IN HONOUR OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO HAD NEGOTIATED IT THOUGH MORALLY DIFFERENT AND OF VERY UNEQUAL WORTH THEY BOTH HAD MINDS OF A RARE ORDER AND TRAINED TO RECOGNISE POLITICAL NECESSITIES AND NOT TO ATTEMPT ANY BUT POSSIBLE SUCCESSES
6599-38590-0009 ALL THE GREAT POLITICAL ACTORS SEEMED HURRYING AWAY FROM THE STAGE AS IF THAT DRAMA WERE APPROACHING ITS END
6599-38591-0000 IN FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO AT THE BATTLE OF DROU HE WAS AGED AND SO ILL THAT NONE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM ON HORSEBACK
6599-38591-0001 HE FULLY ARMED SAVE ONLY HIS HEAD ANSWERED HIM RIGHT WELL SIR THIS IS THE REAL MEDICINE THAT HATH CURED ME FOR THE BATTLE WHICH IS TOWARD AND IS PREPARING FOR THE HONOR OF GOD IN OUR CAMP
6599-38591-0002 THE LADY'S PEACE CONCLUDED AT CAMBRAI IN FIFTEEN TWENTY NINE LASTED UP TO SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX INCESSANTLY TROUBLED HOWEVER BY FAR FROM PACIFIC SYMPTOMS PROCEEDINGS AND PREPARATIONS
6599-38591-0003 AT FIRST HE DECIDED UPON RETREATING
6599-38591-0004 IT WAS GARSILLASO DE LA VEGA THE PRINCE OF SPANISH POSY THE SPANISH PETRARCH ACCORDING TO HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN
6599-38591-0005 MONTMORENCY SIGNED A SIMILAR ONE FOR PIEDHA
6599-38591-0006 THEY ALL REPAIRED TOGETHER TO THE HOUSE PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND AFTER DINNER THE EMPEROR BEING TIRED LAY DOWN TO REST ON A COUCH QUEEN ARTHUR BEFORE LONG WENT AND TAPPED AT HIS DOOR AND SENT WORD TO THE KING THAT THE EMPEROR WAS AWAKE
6599-38591-0007 FRANCES OF THE CARDINAL DE LORRAINE AND THE CONSTABLE DE MONTMORENCY SOON ARRIVED
6599-38591-0008 ON ENTERING THE CHAMBER HE FOUND THE EMPEROR STILL LYING DOWN AND CHATTING WITH HIS SISTER THE QUEEN WHO IS SEATED BESIDE HIM ON A CHAIR
6599-38591-0009 YES SAID JAMES I HAD MADE SUCH CHEER THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SLEEP IT OFF
6599-38591-0010 FRANCIS DID THE CANVAS WITH HIS OWN COLLAR
6599-38591-0011 ONLY SIX OF THE ATTENDANTS REMAINED IN THE EMPEROR'S CHAMBER AND THERE THE TWO SOVEREIGNS CONVERSED FOR AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THEY MOVED TO THE HALL WHERE A SPLENDID SUPPER AWAITED THEM
6599-38591-0012 THE GENTS PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT FORWARD TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE ARE RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ACCESSION
6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT A ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DROPPED BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALLED A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONTAINED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S HOUSEL BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE RIMUDA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDON CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE COWS WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE HOT GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASEWOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN HOLDING A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WILD GATE AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 HE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J H STAMPING IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS AMONG THE FENCE SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTING TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED OFF IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODING AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WILL STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
6841-88291-0013 HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE AROUND THE HORN AND SET OVER IN ONE STRIP TO AVOID THE TIGHTENED LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 NO BODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED THE ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULL DOGGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCE UPON THE VICTOR
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLUPPED OVER TO ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 THUS THE CALF WERE UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE RAIN KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULL DOGGINGS
6841-88291-0021 MARK' YELLED THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BROADER PRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF BLAIDED A LITTLE AS THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOW CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOURED TO INDICATE DUE PEELIN AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOW TAIL ON THE OTHERS
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDON
6841-88291-0027 UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT POWERFUL AND COULD SOME OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADOPT IT IN PREFERENCE
6841-88291-0028 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THE SPRING OF THIS DOCTRINE THROUGH ARIZONA
6841-88291-0029 IMAGINE A PUNCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TAGS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR IN A ROUND CUP
6841-88291-0030 A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEEDING OR TO MOVING IDLY ABOUT
6841-88291-0031 BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT TO THESE OF US WHO HAVE HAD OUR TEETH FILLED
6841-88291-0032 ONE OF THE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS BUT A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEGS BUT TOSSED THIS LOOP OVER ITS NECK
6841-88291-0033 MISTER FROST'S BULL CALF ALONE AND PICTORIAL HISTORY SHEWS THE ATTITUDES
6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS A GLORIOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERPUTABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER
6841-88291-0035 AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS A CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HELD
6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD CAST HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE VIGOROUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING BACK TO THE UPRIGHT
6841-88291-0037 YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED FIRST
6841-88291-0038 THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME MONEY IF IT FAILS
6841-88291-0039 BY NOW THE BROADON WAS IN FULL SWING
6841-88291-0040 WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TO THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID THE CAST FAIL
6841-88291-0041 MEN RAN TO AND FRO BUSY AND IMPATIENT
6841-88291-0042 SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR GALVES WERE ON THE GROUND AT ONCE
6841-88291-0043 DUST ENDED AND DISSIPATED
6841-88291-0044 NO MORE NICK CALVES HE ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0045 THEN HE WOULD SPIT ON HIS HANDS AND GO ABOUT IT ALONE
6841-88291-0046 IF LUCK ATTENDED HIS FIRST EFFORTS HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND THERE'S YOUR LITTLE CALF SAID HE
6841-88291-0047 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THIS FAR WITH YOUR LITTLE LOAD ON
6841-88291-0048 TOWARD NOON THE WORK SLAGGED
6841-88291-0049 FINALLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMEN AND REPORTED THE BRANDY FINISHED
6841-88291-0050 THE LATTER COUNTED THE REMARKS IN HIS TALLY BOOK
6841-88291-0051 ONE HUNDRED IN SEVENTY SIX HE ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0052 THE MARKERS SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS TOLD OVER THE BITS OF ICE THEY HAD SAVED
6841-88291-0053 THE TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
6841-88291-0054 FINALLY WOODDEN DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HIP POCKET
6841-88291-0055 THEY HAD BEEN DOING A WRESLER'S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNING BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED
6841-88291-0056 I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN'S AND THAT IT EXERCISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF A BODY
6841-88294-0000 AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THE STORM ON THE ROOF SEEMED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EAVES
6841-88294-0001 WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKING UP AT A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL
6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEELING CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN MY LEFT LEG
6841-88294-0003 THEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD CUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A MAN
6841-88294-0004 IN PLACE OF THEM HE WORE A SHARP STEEL HOOK
6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEIN ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHING HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DIDN'T SOUND GOOD
6841-88294-0006 WHEN A MAN BREATHES THAT WAY HE'S MOSTLY ALL GOING
6841-88294-0007 MEN GOT BATTED OVER THE HEADS OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
6841-88294-0008 SOUR WINE IS FINE TO PUT A WOUND IN SHAPED TO HEEL BUT IT'S NO SOOTHIN SYRUP
6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRAVE IT WAS THE SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEA DONE ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBARI
6841-88294-0010 IT FAIR MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH THE BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE AND THE QUIET MOONLIGHT AND THE SHADOWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZONING EACH SIDE OF HIS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER THE RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO KEEP HIM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AND PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP
6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN HE'D SING THAT BARBARY SONG UNTIL I'D GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWING BY JIST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DIED AND GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE'D JUST TALK
6841-88294-0013 HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND HE GAVE ITS SIDE OF CONVERSATIONS PAUSING FOR REPLIES
6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THE HOUR BUT HE NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE'D COME FROM OR WHAT HE'D DONE
6841-88294-0015 I DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HE WAS QUIET
6841-88294-0016 USUALLY I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH THIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BUT SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
6841-88294-0017 HE WAS LYING ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME
6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES HE SAID VERY INTENSE
6841-88294-0019 ONE LITTLE SQUEEZE TALK ABOUT THEIR DEADLY WEAPONS
6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'D BEEN TOO QUICK AND TOO LONG ABED
6841-88294-0021 IN A MINUTE OR SO THEY CAME TO
6841-88294-0022 NOW YOU'RE A NICE SMOOTH PROPOSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
6841-88294-0023 THEY'RE SAFE ENOUGH LET ME HAVE THEM HE MURMURED
6841-88294-0024 NOW LOOK HERE SAID I YOU CAN'T GET UP TODAY YOU AINT FIT
6841-88294-0025 AH NO HE PLEADED BUT LET ME SEE THEM
6841-88294-0026 JUST TO SATISFY HIM I PASSED OVER HIS GOLD DUDS
6841-88294-0027 I'VE BEEN ROBBING SHE CRIED
6841-88294-0028 WHERE'S MY COAT HE SAYS
6841-88294-0029 YOU HAD NO COAT WHEN I PICKED YOU UP I EXPLAINED
6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED AT ME MIGHTY SUSPICIOUS BUT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
6841-88294-0031 AFTER HE'D TAKEN A FAIR MEAL HE FELL ASLEEP
6841-88294-0032 WHEN I CAME BACK THAT EVEN THE BUNK WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE
6841-88294-0033 I DIDN'T SEE HER AGAIN FOR TWO DAYS
6841-88294-0034 THEN I GOT SIGHT OF HIM QUITE A WAYS OFF
6841-88294-0035 GUESS IT'S SUSPICIOUS I STOLE THAT OLD COAT OF HIS THINKS I AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT
6841-88294-0036 PERHAPS HE DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THAT FRAME OF MIND
6841-88294-0037 I RAN UP PULLING THE GUN
6841-88294-0038 THE MEX WAS FLAT IN HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
6841-88294-0039 ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK NAIL MY ONE ARMED FRIEND
6841-88294-0040 ANYWAY I THRUST THE MUZZLE OF MY COLT INTO THE STRANGER'S FACE WHAT'S THIS I ASKED
6841-88294-0041 I WEEN HIM ET MONTE OF ANTONIO COVAZ SAID HE
6841-88294-0042 THE GLEAM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SNARL LIFTED TO HIS LIPS
6841-88294-0043 IN ANY CASE HE FLEW POLO PRONTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
6841-88294-0044 DURIN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOSTLY DOIN ODD JOBS I SAW HIM OFF AND ON
6841-88294-0045 HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THE TIME ALMIGHTY BUSY PUTTING DOWN MY CARD GAMES
6841-88294-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YOU'VE BETTER STAY RIGHT THERE
6841-88294-0047 I WANT TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR THEIR TROUBLE SAID HE
6841-88294-0048 WHAT KIND OF GOOD THING I ASKED TREASURE HE
6841-88294-0049 HE LOOKED ALL RIGHT ENOUGH NEITHER DARK NOR LOCO
6841-88294-0050 SET DOWN SAID I OVER HERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE

6841-88294-0054 THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT DO YOU TELL ME
6841-88294-0055 WHY DON'T YOU GET THIS TREASURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF DIVIDING IT
6841-88294-0056 WHY MATES HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAIN GRATITUDE
6841-88294-0057 DIDN'T YOU SAVE MY LIFE AN NUSS ME AND TAKE CARE O ME WHEN I WAS NOT KILLED
6841-88294-0058 LOOK HERE ANDERSON OR HANDY SOLOMON OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO CALL YOURSELF I REJOINED TO THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK STRAIGHT
6841-88294-0059 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY BUT THAT DON'T GO WITH ME
6841-88294-0060 THE DEVIL'S A PREACHER IF YOU AINT LOST YOUR PEN FEATHER SAID HE
6841-88294-0061 WELL IT'S THIS THEN I GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GET THERE AS SHE MUST BE STOCKED

6841-88294-0064 WHY M I ASKED WHY NOT HE RETORTED
6841-88294-0065 SHE TALKED THE MATTER OVER AT LENGTH
6841-88294-0066 WE STOOD OUT FOR A LARGER PARTY
6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS AS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT I HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING ON INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY WE COMPROMISED
6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THE TREASURE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THAT SCHEME DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
700-122866-0000 JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE HERE
700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONSCIENCES SPOIL PEOPLE FOR EVERY DAY LIFE
700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY ROSA DISAPPROVES OF THEM
700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE SENSITIVE YET
700-122866-0004 I JUST LAY AWAKE AND ADMIRED THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OWN GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTS
700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAMS AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY
700-122866-0007 THE WINTER HOURS SLIP BY
700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THE CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON WRITE A COMPOSITION UPON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT
700-122866-0009 I CAN SCARCELY REALISE THAT I M IN MY TEENS
700-122866-0010 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT
700-122866-0011 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BEAUS SAID ANNIE DISDAINFULLY
700-122866-0012 SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ANY ONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN A TAKE NOTE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
700-122866-0013 I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLEN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHES PERFECT
700-122866-0014 IF I HAD ALICE BELL'S CROOKED NOSE SAID ANNE EXCITEDLY I WOULDN'T BUT THERE
700-122866-0015 I'M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT IMPLEMENT ABOUT IT LONG AGO
700-122866-0016 OH DANIEL LOOK THERE'S A RABBIT
700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING HAPPY DREAMS
700-122866-0018 I WROTE IT LAST MONDAY AFTERNOON
700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR OF DEATH NOT DIVIDED
700-122866-0020 I GAVE IT TO MARILLA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF AND NONSENSE
700-122866-0021 IT'S A SOFT SWEET STORY
700-122866-0022 CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORNETTE OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DUSKY FLASHING EYES
700-122866-0023 YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE
700-122866-0024 THEY GREW IN BEAUTIFUL SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE SIXTEEN
700-122866-0025 I ASKED RUBY GILNIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED
700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FRIEND THAT SAME AS EVER
700-122866-0027 LET'S YOU AND ME HAVE A STONE CLUB ALL OUR OWN AND WRITE STORIES FOR PRACTICE
700-122866-0028 YOU WANT TO CULTIVATE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS STACY SAYS SO
700-122866-0029 ONLY WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT AWAY
700-122866-0030 THIS WAS HOW THE STONE CLUB CAME INTO EXISTENCE
700-122866-0031 NO BOOKS WERE ALLOWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MEMBER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK
700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO READ HER STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN YOU TALK IT OVER
700-122866-0033 MINE IS ROSAMOND MONTMORENCYS ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
700-122866-0034 I'M SURE THAT MUST HAVE HAD A WHOLESOME EFFECT
700-122866-0035 THE WORLD IS THE GREAT THING MISTER ALLEN SAYS SO
700-122866-0036 I READ ONE OF THEIR STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLEN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MORAL WAS EXCELLENT
700-122866-0037 JANE AND RUBY ALMOST ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC THOUGHTS
700-122866-0038 MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY WROTE ME THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE
700-122866-0039 I' AM SURE MISSUS ALLEN WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE
700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I SAW THAT
700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE ALWAYS FELT SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANYONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY ARE
700-122866-0042 HOW I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
700-122867-0000 OF VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT
700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND JULIA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL GLADNESS
700-122867-0002 I SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT OR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW
700-122867-0003 PERHAPS YOU'RE JUDGING HER TOO HASTILY MONSIEUR
700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HER PART MARY BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU
700-122867-0005 DEMANDED MARILLA ANXIOUSLY COMING OVER TO THE BED
700-122867-0006 ANNE COWERED DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOREVER FROM MORTAL EYES NOW
700-122867-0007 COME RIGHT UP THIS MINUTE AND TELL ME
700-122867-0008 THIS MINUTE I SEE THERE NOW WHAT IS IT
700-122867-0009 TOM HAD SLID TO THE FLOOR IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE
700-122867-0010 YES IT'S GREEN MOANED DAN
700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS HARD AS RED HAIR
700-122867-0012 YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR HER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
700-122867-0013 WELL THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR
700-122867-0014 AND SHIRLY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO
700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED JOHN
700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DAIN
700-122867-0017 AND MISSUS ALLEN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANYBODY OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY ARE NOT
700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T THEN BUT I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY
700-122867-0019 WHO HAS SAID WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
700-122867-0020 WHY I DIDN'T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE
700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH MY BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE
700-122867-0022 OH MAMMA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTISE TO DECEIVE
700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THIS
700-122867-0024 WITH A DISMAL SIGH SHE WENT WITH THE SCISSORS
700-122867-0025 BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'D DYED IT A DREADFUL COLOR IS THERE
700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO WEEP ALL THE TIME WE'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF IT WON'T INTERFERE
700-122867-0027 THIS SEEMED SUCH A TRAGIC THING
700-122867-0028 ANNE WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT DOWN STAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
700-122867-0029 PERHAPS I WILL TOO
700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT IS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURLING
700-122867-0031 I EXPECT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO MY NOSE FIRST
700-122867-0032 ANN'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER GRIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCARE SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK I DIDN'T
700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FELT VERY VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T IT
700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER IT AND I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE POOR
700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLEN AND MISS STACY AND GROWN UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU
700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON AROUND MY NECK WITH A BOW AT ONE SIDE
700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL IT A SNOON THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
700-122867-0040 MY HEALTH IS BETTER NOW
700-122867-0041 IT WAS TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON SO
700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE ANNE SAID DANIEL
700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW THAT I COULD N'T KEEP STILL
700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO BE A RED HEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNE
700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS A LILY QUEEN
700-122868-0004 OUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY WHICH BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANNE'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATIZE ALAIN
700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID THEY WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT
700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING THE LANE
700-122868-0009 THE BACKSHELL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPED IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISTER LYNDE WAS BORN
700-122868-0011 JANE HE ARRANGES
700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN HE'S DEAD
700-122868-0013 JANE ROUSED TO THE OCCASION
700-122868-0014 LEFT BEHIND AT THE LANDINGS
700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE A GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
700-122868-0016 THERE IS ONE CHANCE JUST NOW
700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWER A PRAYER
700-122868-0018 A FLAT DRIFTED UNDER THE BRIDGE AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MID STREAM
700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING HER ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NO DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY HER SEEMING LIKE AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAID
700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMETHING COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION WENT TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES TO HER
700-122868-0023 AND SHIRILY
700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET IN THERE HE EXCLAIMED
700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED TOM
700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING UP ITS OARS
700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT IN THE BARGE I MEAN THE FLOCK
700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT BEN HESITATED
700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK EAGER LITTLE BEAT
700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IS NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
700-122868-0032 NO HE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
700-122868-0033 ALL ARE RIGHT
700-122868-0034 I'D NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNE SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT SO
700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS INTO SCRAPES
700-122868-0037 MAN'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO DO
700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE TOM GROANED MARILLA
700-122868-0039 I DON'T CARE HOW SAID MARILLA
700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF SOME PRETTY SHORTCOMING
7601-101619-0000 OUR SUPREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IPSOPHYLICITAS SE NISCITEMPERAT PREMIT EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND TO CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THAT TAIL METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE IS SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE A PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXQUISITE REASONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THE SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS
7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIVES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLE IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR GREATER WEIGHT
7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLE AND SENT HIM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAINING WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE
7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE ILLS OF A LONG PIECE OF LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR
7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOT YOUNG MEN WHO ARE THEN IN HIS PAY
7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSE TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT LEISURE FED WITH BLOOD
7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE HONOURS DELAYD FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
7601-101622-0005 LET BEAST'S BLOOD STAIN THE INFAMOUS ARENA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACT
7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND TO DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING HIS DEATH
7601-101622-0007 THE VERY GIRLS THEMSELVES LET THEM ON
7601-175351-0000 THAT BEGINNING OF REVOLT
7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARD THE FORE
7601-175351-0002 LIGHT THAT FIRES EXCLAIMED SOME
7601-175351-0003 WHAT IN ASKED OTHERS
7601-175351-0004 AND STUFFS THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED WARREN
7601-175351-0005 DID YOU HEAR THEM
7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE IT CRIED HATTERAS
7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PENNA ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN
7601-175351-0008 I SAY ASKED PENN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FURTHER
7601-175351-0009 YOU SHAN'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEY SHAN'T LIGHT FIRES
7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABINS AND GUARDED
7601-175351-0011 A MURMUR WAS UTTERED
7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY THE PLOVER AND WARREN WENT DOWN TO HIS POST
7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERED AWAY EASILY CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROW
7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BEHRING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWDED TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERRATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
7601-175351-0015 I'M BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WAL
7601-175351-0016 MATTERAS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THIS ACCOUNTS AS APOCRYPHAL
7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN
7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THAT CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JACKSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK BRAVING THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
7601-175351-0021 THERE IS MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO IMITATE IT I THINK
7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISSUS CLAWBONNY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED THERE
7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WILL MISTER CLAYBONNY
7601-175351-0025 I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANIONS HE'LL HAVE TWO
7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRENELL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WILL NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITTANNIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCYDIDES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HINTS WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE A FAVOURITE THAT THE PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE TRUE SUBJECTS FOR A HISTORIC PEN
7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SINGING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
7601-291468-0003 THEN THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES
7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AND APOTHEGMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SOLIA OPINA
7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATINGS
7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET NOW ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHERCOCKS THAT TURNED AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONG HEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SINGING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIVES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
7641-96252-0000 THUS WHILE DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS STILL THE SAME
7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAPABLE ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MIGHT BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED THROUGH DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE WHEEL AND ANOTHER IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS FAMILY
7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSIONS OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THAT EXPRESSION
7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BLONDS UP A FLEETING AND ELUSIVE PHENOMENON
7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN ANY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFERER
7641-96252-0008 BUT THE LATTER WAS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE SYMPTOM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITE OF THAT STAIN OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN A WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANYONE OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITIONS A JOYFUL ONE YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SERENITY OF DISPOSITION
7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON
7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALIZE THEMSELVES WHILST THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO HAUGHT OR LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTED NO REASON FOR PREFERRING THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS FOR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTWEIGH THE REGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SOCRATES AND GIORDANO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTH OFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HAND OF THE PRIESTS
7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES OR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK INTO ITS SOURCE
7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE FACULTY FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON IMAGINATION
7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS DEPENDS AS FOLLOWS
7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF A SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG WEARY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISH FOR DELIVERANCE
7641-96670-0000 THEY ARE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SESASTRIS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF AA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN HER RISING AND SETTING
7641-96670-0002 MEDIA TOO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THESE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF CRATHEUS AND CRETHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMAS THEIR GRANDFATHER
7641-96670-0004 JASON TOOK PELIAS AND TALAMON WITH HIM
7641-96670-0005 AS THEY CAME TO THIS CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHRIXUS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
7641-96670-0006 THE MISTS LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES THE WONDER OF THE PALACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE CANNAEUS LIVED WITH OBSYRTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDIA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS
7641-96670-0008 THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDIA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THE PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FASSUS
7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST HEROES OF GREECE
7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SRAMATI
7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE IT FOR YOU
7641-96670-0013 ADA'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYE SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
7641-96670-0014 AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON ANSWERED
7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT HIM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE POETS
7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR IT AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU
7641-96670-0018 SHE TURNED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRONG BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
7641-96670-0020 KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF AIS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS
7641-96670-0021 THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMERE GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON
7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECES
7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM YOUR CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS HANDS UPON THE GROUND
7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS ADD AS IT IS
7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDEA GROW WHITE AS WITH FEAR
7641-96670-0027 PHRONTIS AND MELS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
7641-96684-0000 AND AS A MOTIVE APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
7641-96684-0001 EVIDENTLY PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING
7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED UPON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER ADMEUS HAVING LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT HIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE IT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE OH APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID NODMETUS
7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE ME WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE BUT HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR TALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS AND MEDENUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO UNWILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT GENTLEMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN AND HER MATTED HAIR
7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND SHE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE COULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
7641-96684-0016 ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMIN FOR HIM
7641-96684-0017 THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH WHICH WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE WEAK AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
7641-96684-0019 NOW THAT FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP
7641-96684-0020 IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR ME AS BEFORE
7641-96684-0021 AND THE WORDS SHE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR THE
7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME TO THE PALACE
7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE HOUSE
7641-96684-0025 NO MORE OF SPEECH CAME FROM HER
7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THIS CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GODS THAT SACRIFICE DUE
7641-96684-0028 AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER WEAPON WAS BEFORE HIM
7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD IN THE UNDERWORLD
7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOW STRIVE WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THEME IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOME AND TO HER HUSBAND
7641-96684-0032 HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND HE WENT TO A TEMPLE OF THE GODS
7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEAR AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE ABLE PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VALED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGED BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY
7641-96684-0037 THIS I SHALL NOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PAINS ENOUGH
7641-96684-0038 WHEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AND THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD OF THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND IS ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION
7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THAT GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MONEY AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THE MEAN
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM WHICH WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT
7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN WHAT SEEMS THIS
7697-105815-0008 AND YOU NEXT SAW A MAID COMING TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAID IT LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS TRISTRAM CAME UP TO THE KRAUS HIS LOAD SLIPPED FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE IN THY SINS
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CHRISTMAS BLESSED TOMB
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP AND CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU COME
7697-105815-0014 FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND WERE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZION FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 KNOW YOU'RE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO THE SAME AS A THIEF
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE THAT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THERE NO DOUBT OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE'RE GETTING ON THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS
7697-105815-0019 IS NOT OUR NATURE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I THOUGHT THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT THEN WENT UP THE HILL
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF A HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMORA SAID THAT TSUYING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT FOR WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS THROAT FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 HE FELL FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACTION AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW
7697-105815-0028 OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAIL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THE SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS SLEEP
7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN UPON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN ITS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCAW
7697-105815-0033 HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GIVE THANKS TO GOD
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAMP THE HEEL
7697-105815-0035 AH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS REIGNING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HOLD AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT THERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HAVE NONE
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IT IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE WATCHFULL DWELT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT'S YOUR NAME
7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT AGAIN TO THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0043 HAETE COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL BUT I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT THIAHN
7697-105815-0046 HERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD
7697-105815-0047 CHARITY ARE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE
7697-105815-0048 CHARITY I WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAD THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG THE HYMN
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JOHN BONE OF THE ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAIN AND THE STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LANDS SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS A MANUS LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL AT YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JUDGE THY GREAT DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE OF SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THIS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIANS
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID CHRISTIAN AND LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SET OFF FOR THE FIELDS
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GIVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT FOR OUR GOOD
7697-105817-0008 CHRISTIAN WE MUST NEVER STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SAID DRY IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN THERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FOR THIS
7697-105817-0011 AND BY THIS ACT WE CURE OUR OWN SOULS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MEN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER A MAN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENT MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DISBEADE HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH AS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 THIRDLY THIS IS PRODUCED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAT IT IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATIONAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY COULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET THE ANIMALS TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AND IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE HIGHEST INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATE ME IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEAN OVER PLAN
7697-245712-0013 NOW E MEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN IN OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNI HAVE BEEN STERILE
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN A BODILY DISPARITY
7697-245712-0016 INEQUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTS OF NATURE
7697-245712-0017 ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THAT STATE OF INNOCENCE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREEMAN CAN BE CALLED MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND THE MEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS IN OLD AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN COULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY MUST HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISS VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU DOUBTLESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED GLADLY
8173-294714-0003 THIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THAT NEGATIVE DEFENCE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THING A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY SOME MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE EXCLAIMED
8173-294714-0008 YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN THE SECRET IS ALL YOURS
8173-294714-0009 WHAT LONG ARE YOU TALKING OF
8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING WELL
8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING UP THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER PRESENT FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS THE CHILD PRIDE SHE REPLIED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS
8173-294714-0016 A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A MARKED HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR HIS FOOD AND SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THIS IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME AND HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
8173-294714-0020 YOUR ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY HER PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS SHOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 ALL WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK TO IT
8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED IT AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THIS NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HIS SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME SHE SAID
8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESERVE AND BE FORGIVEN
8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO BE HER ONLY FRIEND
8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW THEY CAN HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT I HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH
8173-294714-0033 KEEP ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATES OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRENT
8173-294714-0036 DOES THINKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY MAY YOU HESITATE
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELEASE YOUR ANXIETIES
8173-294714-0039 NEVERTHELESS LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH
8173-294714-0040 THAT IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YET THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GREAT FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS COMPLETELY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESSES
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT AN DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO A HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO SEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS THE MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
8173-294714-0048 YOU HAVE QUITE MISTAKEN I REPLIED
8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON A POLICY OF INSURANCE
8173-294714-0051 I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS SHE SAID SADLY
8173-294714-0052 WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY SUPERIORS
8173-294714-0053 THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHY OR EXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
8173-294714-0054 CAUTIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSED MYSELF HER CURIOSITY TOOK THE ALARM
8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU FROM MISTER VAN BRANDT SHE REJOINED AND I SHALL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY
8173-294714-0056 WE COULD HONESTLY PROMISE THAT
8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HIM LAY IN KEEPING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE THE COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO NOW MY RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
8173-294714-0059 KISS ME SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU GOES
8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY YOUR GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERS ME
8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY AT THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
8254-115543-0001 EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF CONTRARY ORDERS
8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING AND SCOLDING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES TO THE WAGON
8254-115543-0003 IT WAS QUITE A PROCESSION WHEN AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY
8254-115543-0004 BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER IN HER DULY DECKED A SORT OF LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SEWN BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES
8254-115543-0005 BESIDES THE FAMILY THERE WERE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING WAGON
8254-115543-0006 THE COOK TOO WENT WITH IT
8254-115543-0007 GOOD BY SHOUTED LITTLE KNOLL FROM HIS GARDEN WHILES THEY WENT BY GOOD BYE
8254-115543-0008 THEY SHOUTED GREETINGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE POTTER AS THEY PASSED HIM AND ALSO TO THE OLD FAKIR SMEARED ALL OVER WITH ASHES WHO SATE IN A LITTLE BRICK HUT BY THE BRIDGE AND PRETENDED TO MAKE WONDERFUL CURES
8254-115543-0009 THIS IS MORE FUN THAN GOING TO SCHOOL SAID POLA AS THE OXEN PLODDED ALONG THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
8254-115543-0010 THESE LOVELY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS GROWN QUITE WILD
8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS BUT HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS
8254-115543-0012 AS THE WAGON CAME UP A YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THE HOLY MAN RAN UP AND HELD OUT A BEGGING BOWL SAYING GIVE A CHARITABLE PEOPLE TO THIS HOLY ONE
8254-115543-0013 NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MANY WARRIORS AS INDIA
8254-115543-0014 MANY OF EM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM
8254-115543-0015 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG FELLOW WENT TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEAR THEM
8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THEY ARE DOGS SAID MOHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CANE DOWN BY A STREAM
8254-115543-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN BUY SOME FROM THAT MAN THERE HE IS NOW PLOWING BY THE STREAM SAID COLLA
8254-115543-0018 IT IS LOOKING FOR WATER SAID THE FARMER AS HE TOOK A LAST STOCK OF CAE AND GENTLY GUIDED IT DOWN TO THE STREAM
8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS ANOTHER SACRED ANIMAL OF THE HINDOOS AND WOULD NOT KILL OR INJURE ONE FOR ANYTHING
8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY HEARD A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD
8254-115543-0021 IT TURNED OUT THAT HE WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING IN STATE ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJA OR RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MODERN INDIA WAS FORMERLY MADE UP
8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEGANT ALL DECORATED WITH SILK AND GOLD AND SILVER
8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS THE HOWOUDAH WHICH WAS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS THE RAJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLORED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN
8254-115543-0024 BEHIND THAT HOWDAH STOOD A SERVANT HOLDING A BIG UMBRELLA OF FINE FEATHERS OVER THE RAJAH'S HEAD
8254-115543-0025 THE DRIVER SAT ON THE NECK OF A ELEPHANT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST BY PRODDING HIM ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN IRON SHOD STICK OR GOAD
8254-115543-0026 ISN'T IT FUN TO RIDE LIKE THAT ON A BIG ELEPHANT
8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF THAT DAY THE LITTLE FOLK TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE GREAT RAJAH AND HIS ESCORT
8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND UPON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS OR BARGAINING FOR FOOD AT THE LITTLE BOOTH
8254-115543-0029 THESE THEY USED FOR TABLES HEAPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICE AND CURRY AND FISH AND ALL SORTS OF PUTTINGS AND SWEETS
8254-115543-0030 A SUPPER WAS BEING EATEN ANOTHER PARTY STOPPED AT THE PARTRAL ENCAMPED NOT FAR AWAY
8254-115543-0031 WHEN THAT LITTER WAS PUT DOWN A YOUNG BOY STEPPED OUT LOOKING VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY
8254-115543-0032 HIS SERVANTS AT ONCE SPREAD A HANDSOME RUG ON THE GROUND FOR HIM TO SIT ON AND RUSHED ABOUT ON HIM TAKING GOOD CARE TO KEEP EVERY ONE AT A DISTANCE
8254-115543-0033 YES AND HOW HE ORDERS EVERY ONE ABOUT IT
8254-115543-0034 ROUND THE LITTLE BRAHMAN'S NECK WAS A THIN CORD OR THREAD WHICH WAS THE SIGN OF HIS HIGH CASTE
8254-115543-0035 MEANWHILE THE HAUGHTY LITTLE BRAHMIN ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HIS HEAD TURNED AWAY SO NO ONE COULD SEE HIM EAT AND THEN GROWING TIRED OF RESPECTFUL GLANCES OF THE CROWD ABOUT HIM HE GOT INTO HIS LITTER AGAIN AND THE SERVANTS FASTENED THE CURTAINS TIGHTLY AROUND HIM
8254-115543-0036 EVERYBODY SLEPT SOUNDLY IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE SERVANTS WAS BEATING A DRUM MOST OF THE NIGHT WHICH THEY REALLY BELIEVED WAS THE WAY TO KEEP OFF EVIL SPIRIT
8254-115543-0037 NO THE THIEVES HE CRIED
