116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD THE BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THE THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILINGLY AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND SHE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 HE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SLIGHTLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU HAVE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GUIDE
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CONDUCT THE BISHOP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AN IDOL I WHISPERED TAKEN WITH SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPPED GODS BUT DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LIKE THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAMOUR IN MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NO I ASKED IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDOL YET AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 IT MADE ATHENS A CITY OF LIGHT IT CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES MY RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT RETORTED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANSWER SHOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 PRODUCED HIM
116-288045-0015 AND I WHISPERED TO MYSELF WHAT BLASPHEMY
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE ON MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNING THE DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT LOVER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOMER THE INSPIRED BARDE
116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLLO IS ONLY AN IDOL
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AS THE SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE A VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MIEN OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT THE PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTHDAY OF THAT BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH A SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY INTO HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH WOMAN HE WAS ONLY AN IDOL
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY MAN ANSWERING TO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTED TURNING TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 WILL HE NOT BE HERE NEXT MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO THIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO ASSIST HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDERING AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT AND THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF AN IDOL AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKES HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CANDIED DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THIS ONE IN HAND THAN IN A MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURES IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY GIVE FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN READING
116-288046-0004 O HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE IS NOT BUILT UP IS ANOTHER CRITICISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHY OR PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTH AND A JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF THE STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRINDALL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY A PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WISH YOU TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 BUT FIRST LET US BE IMPERSONAL AND EPITHETS IRREVERENT BLASPHEMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG AT A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM ENVY
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WEIGHING THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST ANIMATED BY THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BY CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 A MYTH IS A FANCIEL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 A MIND CRAVES FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN INBORN DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO SNAP ON EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS PHHOS THE PRIMITIVE MAN WAS SATISFIED UNTIL HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED ITS INADEQUACY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALIZATION
116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED FELLOW LIVING IN INDIA HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE HINDUS
116-288047-0005 BUT THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MYTHS HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JESUS A MY
116-288047-0007 THERE IS IN MAN AN FACULTY FOR FICTION
116-288047-0008 IT SPEAKS LESS THAN IT GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BIT INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURBING ITS BASE AND SUBDUING ITS RELENTLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FILL THIS SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE AND AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 WE COVET THE RAINBOW WE REACH UP FOR THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET DO NOT MERELY BEGIN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORNE UNTIL MAN HAD MATURED
116-288047-0014 IT GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FACES TO MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THUS SCHOOL IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 THE RELIGION IS THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILD
116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTH PEACE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT WAS TO BE REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THEIR EVIDENCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABORER HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR A REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DATES WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES AS THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPELS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN AND IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 IF THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 WHY A DISCREPANCY IN THE HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KEEP THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS ABOUT JESUS WE MEET THE GREATER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WHILE IT IS ALWAYS ON THE FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON FOLLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN AND THE ZODIAC AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN AUSTRALIA HAS BECOME THAT CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE OREGEN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS SKEPTICAL CELSUS ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISTS OF DISEASE
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATELY COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYSTICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 AND WHO WAS MATTHEW WHO WAS MARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN AND PETER JUDAS AND MARY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCES THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH HIS NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRINCIPLE OF A MYTH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER AND PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF THEM
116-288048-0019 COULD THAT HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 HOW ELSE IS THIS UNANIMOUS ACTION TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTE
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BY THE LORD NOW AND BY HELL FIRE HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 NOW THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JUDAS MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTES WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS SHOULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE THIS PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF DELUDED PRIVATES THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND YOU CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH THE PREACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARRIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THIS PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF WE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID I NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF COMFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF BEAUTY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR METEIA OF MANIFESTATION IS LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH IT
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE BLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED IN THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH HE SEEMED HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG AND WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS POINT SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONE
1255-138279-0008 TWO EIGHT
1255-138279-0009 FIVE FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH ENTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE THOUGHT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINTER
1255-138279-0013 THE WATER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDDLE AND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW WERE STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 BUT A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 IN THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I HAD ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 WELL I SAID THAT YOU COULD
1255-138279-0019 OH MIGHT I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 I HAVE MY MONEY
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WELL THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I MUST
1255-138279-0023 BUT THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK
1255-138279-0024 GOOD NIGHT FRANKE GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 THINGS WILL ARRANGE THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNTESS NEVER GAVE WAY ONE INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULEY
1255-74899-0003 I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH MIGHT MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL WAITED FOR SOME DELAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONTINUED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN MEN
1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT ON HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT OF THE LOVELL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THEY ARE COALS ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO WE HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT FIRST I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE HER MASTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS THE ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOY MISTER THWAITE SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 AND I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MAY BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU REALLY WISH THAT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED INSS ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK UP IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I'D SOONER SEE YOU DARNED MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEETHEAR
1255-74899-0021 AND I CAN DO THAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AND NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND WROTE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTOWARD MOMENT
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE SMILED
1255-90407-0003 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT ONCE
1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD NOT THINK SO
1255-90407-0006 HE'S MY WIFE INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE AND THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER'S IS OF A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 BUT I COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'RE HEARD SIR
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF ITS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR YOUR EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 WERE THAT THIS EVENING
1255-90407-0014 THERE ON THE NETS THEY SET
1255-90407-0015 JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS
1255-90407-0016 NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMONT TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE AND THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL AND
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL THEN
1255-90407-0020 HE STEADIED HER STEADILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 IT PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOARD AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH HE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU AWAY SOMETHING TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS THEY COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH A LIMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PESON
1255-90407-0028 HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING A WALK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAVE GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE ABBES CARRON
1255-90413-0000 AND SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS KINAVAN'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 OTHERWISE THEY KEPT APART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 IT WAS NOT ALL
1255-90413-0004 BUT WAS HE RIGHT
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH ALTHOUGH SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 WE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF MAKING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POOL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND RETURNED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD HEIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED AROUND AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF THE PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD YOUR HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DIDN'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY I MURMURED IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS ALMOST UNCIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT BRING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANTERCLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSCELYN PIERRON
1255-90413-0019 NOW DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINEAVON WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WOMAN'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY ARRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMP LIGHT NICOLA PINE AVE
1255-90413-0023 THEY HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND THEY TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE PRISON IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TRYING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE HOPED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THIS WAY OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSED COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOUR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS VIEWED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD AND YET SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THEIR ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSALVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN RIGHTENING
1585-131718-0007 YES THE VERY VIGUAL OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LINEING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR THE STREET LINING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRING IN FACT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THAT INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMICAL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES AND THE LEADING CITIES
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHTS CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWED
1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCLINTE BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN IS TAKEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TODAY THE HUNDREDS OF SITTERS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS AMOUNT OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLIER OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WERE PLENTY
1585-131718-0020 THAT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE JEANNIE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM IN THE BALASTON WATGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WE'D SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT UP TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY OUT IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STOPPED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLUE TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 I THEN GOT ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY
1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO ADDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AN IMPORTING IN A CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOERWORK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE THE PARADES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON OOCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMEROUS OTHER DETAILS
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLYLIGHT COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOWROOMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THE PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS THE PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE
1585-131718-0033 THE EXPERIENCE WITH A LITO GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A LAND
1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS THIRTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEE HIVE DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY AND ITS ARDONACLET OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGRERS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE A WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT
1585-131718-0040 I HEARD NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
1585-131718-0041 AND I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO TO NOTICE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMANE
1585-131718-0044 HE WOULD COME WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN
1585-131718-0045 ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN AROUND TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE TO NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLINS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO HAD USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE
1585-131718-0048 HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE BIRDS AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLS DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN'S STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAND FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS HOING FIRST
1585-131718-0051 I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST A CLOAK
1585-131718-0052 THEN THEY GOT A PLEURACIAN HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF NOTING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS DECLARED
1585-157660-0000 LONDON IS GOT AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MEN ARE MOULDED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOMES MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE OLD STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAMS STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UNDER THE FOLLOWING ORRITORICAL FLIGHT
1585-157660-0003 OH GLORIOUS LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WONDERFUL ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEATEN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATIONS
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWN AND COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WILL AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERING AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE ENFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THE SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD IS GLOWING EXPECTATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPORTATIONS FOULTS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST A PROMISES AND OFT HE HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLITS
1585-157660-0009 DOSIS ONE DABBLE WHEN SIX IS TREBACOY
1585-157660-0010 WILLAM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CENIPOT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION
1585-157660-0011 A POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE A WORD FOR IT
1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON THE CASTE AND TO WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANTS BU PAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD STEPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCAL
1585-157660-0015 THE PREENIES SHOP OF FOWL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVEN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES BURRYBRIDGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS PLOFF MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FATAL AND INEFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING HERE WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THE HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE MASTER
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TRIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DESTROYS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY ACQUIRED A TRULY LOVE OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT EPOCH OF THE SOUL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHABARI GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WERE STIRRED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT EXHAUSTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ODORS WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR VIOLENT FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 BY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GRIP OF AN INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE AND DEATH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING SOULS INTO A DEFINITE PASSIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEIR OWN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MASTERING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT A PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING OUR STEPS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A JUST FREEDOM OF POLITICS AND OF FIGHTING IN FREEDOM'S CAUSE
1630-102884-0016 IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF INERTIA WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUTH AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY BOTH WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND OUTSIDE IT
1630-141772-0000 ON THE FRADZEN HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAGSTAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND CHILDLIKE MOAN
1630-141772-0001 SUDDENLY HE AGAIN FELT THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BURNING LACERATING PAIN IN HIS NECK
1630-141772-0002 WAS HIS VERY FIRST THOUGHT
1630-141772-0003 HE FEEBLY MOVED HIS LEG AND UTTERED A WEAK SICKLY GROAN WHICH AROUSED HIS OWN BODY
1630-141772-0004 LIFT THIS YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRIED HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TERRIBLE PAIN OF BEING LIFTED ON TO A STRETCHER THE JOLTING WHILE BEING MOVING AND THE PROBING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0006 DURING THIS TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WERE ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPEAK
1630-141772-0007 HE ASKED ON HEARING THE PRISONERS
1630-141772-0008 I COMMAND IT AS SQUADRON REPLIED RENIN
1630-141772-0009 PRINCE REPNON NAMED LIEUTENANT SUCTELON
1630-141772-0010 AFTER THAT LOOKING AT HIM NAPOLEON SMILED
1630-141772-0011 YOUTH IS NO HINDRANCE TO COURAGE MUTTERED SUCCOY IN A FAILING VOICE
1630-141772-0012 A SPLENDID RELIEF SAID NAPOLEON
1630-141772-0013 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYE TO COMPLETE THE SHOW OF PRISONERS COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHONE WITH SELF SATISFACTION OR PLEASURE
1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD IVORN PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOR THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY NOW HASTENED TO RETURN THE HOLY IMAGE
1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED BUT THE LITTLE IKON WITH ITS THICK GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT UD BE TO KNOW WHERE TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND A GRAVE
1630-141772-0018 HOW HAPPY AND CALM I SHOULD BE IF I COULD ONLY SAY LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME
1630-141772-0019 EITHER TO A POWER INDEFINABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHICH I NOT ONLY CANNOT ADDRESS BUT WHICH I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS IN WORDS THE GREATEST ALL OR NOTHING SAID HE TO HIMSELF OR TO THAT GOD WHO HAS BEEN SOWN INTO THIS AMULET BY MARY
1630-141772-0020 THE SKETCHERS MOVED ON
1630-141772-0021 THE QUIET HOME LIFE AND PEACEFUL HAPPINESS OF BOL HILLS PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM
1630-141772-0022 KATE IS A NERVOUS BILIOUS SUBJECT SAID LARRY AND WILL NOT RECOVER
1630-73710-0000 IT IS AT THE FOOT OF WOMAN THAT WE LAY THE LAURELS THAT WITHOUT HER SMILE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GAINED IT IS HER IMAGE THAT STRINGS THE LYRE OF THE POET THAT ANIMATES A VOICE IN THE BLAZE OF ELOQUENT FACTION AND GUIDES HER BRAIN IN THE AUGUST TOILS OF STATELY COUNCILS
1630-73710-0001 IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR THEM SO FULL OF HOPE
1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE MORE TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO THE IMAGINATION
1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCURRED FLITS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OBSCURING ALL OUR GAY FANCIES WITH ITS BAT LIKE WING AND TAINTING THE HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF HER HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPIRATIONS
1630-73710-0004 MINE OWN I
1630-73710-0005 WHAT DEAD WHAT COULD YOU DO
1630-73710-0006 I BET ABOUT MY CHAMBER LIKE THE FILLY BIRD IN A CAGE
1630-73710-0007 DO NOT THINK OF DOING TO DAY
1630-73710-0008 WILL NOT KEEP THE MESSENGER AN INSTANT
1630-73710-0009 KISSING MY PONY
1630-73710-0010 I WRITE ONLY ONE WORD TO YOUR OWN HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0011 FERORDINANT TO HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0012 GOD BLESS YOU MY HENRIETTA MY BELOVED MY MATCHLESSLY HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0013 WHAT HAS THAT SEPARATION NOW COST ME
1630-73710-0014 PANGS THAT I COULD NOT CONCEIVE NO HUMAN MISERY COULD OCCASION
1630-73710-0015 AND YET WE OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT HE WAS UNINJURED LAST NIGHT
1630-73710-0016 I DARE NOT NOW OWN TO HOW FOOLISH I WAS
1630-73710-0017 DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH HIM HENRIETTA BUT I'M NERVOUS ABOUT CONCEALING OUR ENGAGEMENT FROM PAPA
1630-73710-0018 DAYS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE YOU CAN REACH BATH AND I KNOW FERDINAND YOU KNOW YOUR OFFICE IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WILL CONFESS
1630-73710-0019 BUT COME BACK MY OWN AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND READ TO ME AT THE POST OFFICE AS YOU'RE SETTLED
1630-73710-0020 BUT THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YOU ARE SO NEAR MAKES ME RESTLESS
1630-73710-0021 I WISH TO SEE HIM WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS AS I CAN COMMAND
1630-96099-0000 IT TOO SIR YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERTAKE
1630-96099-0001 THEN SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HE HAS SOME SPECIAL INVITATION SOME GREAT NEWS
1630-96099-0002 WHEN BLOCH APPEARED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG WITH HIM
1630-96099-0003 GONE NOW JUST WHEN WE FIRST WARNED HIM NEVER
1630-96099-0004 ETIAD TRIPLE ETIATE
1630-96099-0005 YOU SHALL BE DISMISSED DISCHARGED FROM THE CZAR YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO THE CAUSE
1630-96099-0006 IT'S THAT OF YOUR GREAT GLUTTONY
1630-96099-0007 MY GRANDMOTHER MADE HIMSELF MOST PLEASANT
1630-96099-0008 WELL AT ANY RATE FROM MY SINS I ACCEPTED
1630-96099-0009 WE ENTERED THE FIRST RESTAURANT THAT OF THE REUNITED TRENDS YOU KNOW IT PERHAPS MISTER
1630-96099-0010 I HAD NO FEAR OF HIM NO TILL THE VERY LAST WHEN HE PLAYED ME THIS EVIL TURN
1630-96099-0011 I SUSPECTED NOTHING WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT HIS POCKETBOOK IT WAS STUFFED FULL MESSIEURS I SAW THAT AND MY CONSCIENCE INCREASED CALLED FOR THE RECKONING AND PAID WITH AN ITALIAN BANK NOTE
1630-96099-0012 EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT SIR
1630-96099-0013 HE WENT OUT MESSIER AND PIFFE HE WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN
1630-96099-0014 WHY LET HIM OUT OF THY SIGHT
1630-96099-0015 IT WAS ONLY NOW AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR THAT THE ITALIAN HAD BECOME INCULPATED AND THE QUESTION OF THE POSSIBLE ANXIETY TO ESCAPE HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED
1630-96099-0016 HE LEFT EVERYONE BEHIND
1630-96099-0017 HAND IT TO ME SAID A CHIEF AND WHEN IT CAME INTO HIS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES HURRIEDLY
1630-96099-0018 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND NOT MORE THAN A WORD HERE AND THEN
1630-96099-0019 IT IS NO DOUBT TAKEN
1630-96099-0020 OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WOULD NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT AND THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OR OF MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE
1630-96099-0021 IT WAS A NOTE FOR ONE HUNDRED LIRA A HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS HA
1630-96099-0022 HE WAS MUCH PRESSED IN A HURRY
1630-96099-0023 DIRECTLY HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED THE DEAF
1630-96099-0024 HE WAS TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT THEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CAB AND WERE DRIVEN AWAY TOGETHER
1650-157641-0000 THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE THROUGHOUT SMOKING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER WAS CURIOUS
1650-157641-0001 NOW MISSUS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IN A SMOKING HUMOR AND I SHALL PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHT
1650-157641-0002 BUT SEE HERE YOU ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU
1650-157641-0003 THE DWARF'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE PECULIAR
1650-157641-0004 BUT WELP AND BRASS WERE NOW IN SOCIETY
1650-157641-0005 THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE OPONETS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO
1650-157641-0006 ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THAT GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATES SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR SMOKING AMONG OFFICERS OF THE ARMY
1650-157641-0007 THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ADOOUR OF TOBACCO AND THE DISTRUSTED THE MAN WHO SMOKED
1650-157641-0008 HERE IS FISTUDO'S OR THACKERAY'S COMMENT ON IT WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
1650-157641-0009 I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT THE WOMEN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RELIGION
1650-157641-0010 I WOULD LAY A GUINEA BUT THE MANY LADY WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I'M A SMOKER AND SAYS OH THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE
1650-157641-0011 GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR THREESCORE YEARS FRANCE SMOKES TO A DAY
1650-157641-0012 PSCH LOOK AT HIS PROGRESS
1650-157641-0013 THUS THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS NOW BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING ROOMS
1650-157641-0014 THE JOURNALISTS AND THE BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THEIR COGERS WERE ABOUT WERE BELOW THE BIG TASTES OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS THE FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS
1650-157641-0015 BOTH QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE PRINCE CONSLOR DETESTED IT SO TOBACCO WAS TABOO WHEREVER THAT COURT WAS
1650-167613-0000 THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT THIS PRINCE ANDREW APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA
1650-167613-0001 SEAS WERE BROUGHT IN AND SOLES WAS THIRTY
1650-167613-0002 THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT THE PEER'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF THE MUSICOTE AND THE POSITION OF OUR ARMY FROM WHICH HE HAD RIDDEN
1650-167613-0003 SO I UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS
1650-167613-0004 NOW BEING A MILITARY MAN THEY CAN'T SAY I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL POSITION
1650-167613-0005 WELL THEN YOU KNOW MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE BE IT WHO IT MIGHT SAID PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0006 AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BARCLAY DE TOULLY
1650-167613-0007 PURE LOOKED AT MALCOLM WITH A CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH EVERYONE INVOLUNTARILY ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER
1650-167613-0008 WE SEE LIGHT AGAIN SINCE HIS SERENITY HAS BEEN APPOINTED YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID MOCKING TIMIDLY AND CONTINUALLY TURNING TO GLANCE AT THIS COLONEL

1650-167613-0020 THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF BODIES OF TROOP CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO ANY MAN
1650-167613-0021 SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ON NUMBERS AND THE LEAST OF ALL ON POSITIONS BUT ON WHAT THEN
1650-167613-0022 ON THE FEELING THAT IS IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMALKIN AND HE IS SOLDER
1650-167613-0023 THEIR BATTLE IS WON BY THOSE WHO FIRMLY RESOLVE TO WIN IT
1650-167613-0024 WHY DID WE LOSE THE BATTLE AT THE OUSMULLERS
1650-167613-0025 WE'VE LOUSED TO LET US RUN AND WE RUN

1650-167613-0053 AND YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING
1650-167613-0054 ONE PICTURE SUCCEEDED ANOTHER INTO HIS IMAGINATION
1650-167613-0055 BY ONE OF THEM HE DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY
1650-173551-0000 HIS MAJORDOMO CAME IN A SECOND TIME TO SAY THAT A FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT A LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND THAT SOME ONE FROM BOZZETEV'S WIDOW HAD A COW TO ASK PIERRE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOK AS SHE HERSELF WAS LEAVING FOR THE COUNTRY
1650-173551-0001 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE POSITION
1650-173551-0002 THE HAL PORTER WAS STANDING ON THE FRONT DOOR
1650-173551-0003 FROM THE LANDING WHERE BILLY STOOD THERE WAS A SECOND STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE BACK ENTRANCE
1650-173551-0004 HE WENT DOWN THAT STAIR CASE AND OUT INTO THE YARD NO ONE HAS SEEN HIM
1650-173551-0005 WHEN HE FELT THAT HE WAS BEING LOOKED AT HE BEHAVED LIKE AN OSTERBRIDGE WHICH HID ITS HEAD IN A BUSH IN ORDER NOT TO BE SEEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND QUICKENING HIS PACE WENT DOWN THE STREET
1650-173551-0006 HE HIRED THE FIRST A CAB HE MET AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE PATRIARCH'S POUNCE WHERE THE WIDOW BARSITIVE'S HOUSE WAS
1650-173551-0007 THIS WAS THE AUTHENTIC SCOTCH ACT WITH PATHATIVES NOTES AND EXCLAMATIONS
1650-173551-0008 HE SAT DOWN AT THE DUSTY WRITING TABLE AND HAVING LAID A MANUSCRIPT BEFORE HIM OPENED THEM OUT CLOSED THEM FINALLY PUSHED THEM AWAY AND RESTING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND SANK INTO MENDICATION
1650-173551-0009 MAKARY ALEXROVITCH CAME TWICE THAT EVENING SHUFFLING ALONG IN HIS SCLASHES AS FAR AS THE DOOR AND STOPPED AND LOOKED INGRATIATEDLY AT PIERRE
1650-173552-0000 AT THAT VERY TIME AT TEN IN THE MORNING OF THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER NAPOLEON WAS STANDING AMONG HIS TROOPS ON THE PYCLONIC HILL LOOKING AT THE PANORAMAS SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM
1650-173552-0001 THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE MORNING IT WAS MAGICAL
1650-173552-0002 BUT MY CLEMENCY IS ALWAYS READY TO DESCEND UPON THAT VANQUISHED
1650-173552-0003 YET HERE SHE IS LYING AT MY FEET WITH HER GOLDEN DOMES AND CRORUSES CINGULATING IN A TWINKLING IN THE SUNSHINE
1650-173552-0004 BUT WE SHALL SPARE HER
1650-173552-0005 FROM THE HIDE OF THE KREMELIN YES THE YEAR IS THE KREMELIN YES I WILL GIVE THEM JUST THE LOUGHS I WILL TEACH THEM THE MEANING OF TRUE CIVILIZATION I WILL MAKE GENERATIONS OF BOYARS REMEMBER THEIR CONQUEROR WITH LAUD
1650-173552-0006 I WILL TELL THE DEPUTATION THAT I DENOUNCE AND DO NOT DESIRE WAR THAT I'VE WAGE THE WAR ONLY AGAINST THE FALSE POLICY OF THEIR COURT THAT I LOVE AND RESPECT ALEXANDER AND THAT IN MASSACRE I WILL ACCEPT TERMS OF PEACE WORTHY OF MYSELF AND OF MY PEOPLE
1650-173552-0007 I DO NOT WISH TO UTILIZE THE FORTUNES OF WAR TO HUMILIATE AND HONOUR THAT MONARCH
1650-173552-0008 YOU WILL HAVE TO BE TOLD ALL THE SAME SAYS SOME GENTLEMEN OF THE SUITE BUT GENTLEMEN
1650-173552-0009 A SINGLE REPORT OF THE SINKING GUN FOLLOWED AND THE TROOPS WHO WERE ALREADY SPREAD OUT ON DIFFERENT SIDES SOUTH MOSCOW MOVED INTO THE CITY THROUGH VORD KALOUGA AND DARGOMLEVKAS
1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER TO WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED A MAJESTIC TEACHER OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WISDOM
1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH HE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH HE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHERE I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO NAME IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN AT NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED MY TITLE
1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMBLED TOGETHER IN AS AWNED A MANNER AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE EFFECT
1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS JOHNSON'S ABBREVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HAND IS MENTIONED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING CEREMONY
1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF BAD HABITS NEGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED BY THEM
1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENCE OF THE OTHERS UNSUSPECTING AS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
1651-136854-0009 YOUTH AMBITIOUS AS THINKING HONOURS EASY TO BE FOUND
1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KINDS OF TRAINS PURSUED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCION MANHOOD
1651-136854-0012 BOTH
1651-136854-0013 SCHOLAR'S FRIENDSHIP LIKE THESE
1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO ONE BY WORDS REPELLED BY PASSIONS
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THE RETURN
1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY HINDERS OUR COMPLIANCE
1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCES INSOLENCE AND AMBITION
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD IN EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST DO LITTLE
1651-136854-0019 OF A CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIORS EVERY ONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION ITS OWN INTEREST
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HAD HARDLY UNITED SCARCE EVER WITHOUT CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MANY AGAINST TWELVE
1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO WRONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED OF THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAD A MORE READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE PERSON CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GUARD AND EXCITE AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN USEFUL WISE AND INNOCENT AND THE DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND WHOLLY
1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR OBLIGATION DENIES YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM OUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 FOUR THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANT OF STOICISM AS THE SUN OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENTENCES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS AND PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRATES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABBLER TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT IN A LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAVE FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL THESE HAVE BEEN INTERWOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
1651-136854-0032 OUR STYLES DIFFER AS PLAIN CLOTH AND BROCADE
1686-142278-0000 HE WAS CAUGHT
1686-142278-0001 NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES OR CRIMSON AND AMBER TINS
1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY SKETCHING THE CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN
1686-142278-0003 HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANY THING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH THE REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF ITS BRIEF SUCCESS AND ALL THE SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECT OF HIS DESIRES OH DEAR
1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WHIRL OF THOUGHT WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANY THING LIKE ORDER
1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD NO RESPONSES ALL TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0006 SHE FORGOT THAT HE HAD NOT MADE THEM ANY OFFER
1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING BEDTIME WERE GONE THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN
1686-142278-0008 WHILE
1686-142278-0009 AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0010 VERY VARIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH THE FATHER AFTER HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON THOUGHT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MONTH OR TWO
1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THIS SIGHT OF THIS SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0015 BUT WHY MY DEAR PAPA DO TELL ME
1686-142278-0016 BECAUSE I COULD NO LONGER BE A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
1686-142278-0017 BUT NOTHING BUT THE SHOCK SHE RECEIVED FROM MISTER HALE'S LAST SPEECH WHAT COULD HE MEAN
1686-142278-0018 IT WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR BEING SO
1686-142278-0019 WHY CAN NO LONGER BE A CLERGYMAN
1686-142278-0020 SURELY IF THE BISHOPS WERE TOLD ALL WE KNOW ABOUT FREDERICK AND THE HARD AND JUST
1686-142278-0021 MARGARET I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT IT
1686-142278-0022 I WILL ANSWER MANY QUESTIONS THIS ONCE BUT AFTER TO NIGHT LET US NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN
1686-142278-0023 I CAN METE THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY MISERABLE MISERABLE DOUBTS BUT IT IS AN EFFORT BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING
1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION NOT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THAT HE CAUSED
1686-142278-0025 MARGARET STOPPED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEW HORROR
1686-142278-0026 MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE LONELY CHURCH FROM WHICH I AM TO BE SHUT OUT
1686-142278-0027 HE COULD NOT GO ON FOR THE MOMENT OR TWO
1686-142278-0028 MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WERE ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETEAN
1686-142278-0029 THE ONE STAYED FOUNDATION OF HER HOUSE OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING
1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER INTO THE CAUSE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW INVOLVED
1686-142278-0031 LISTEN DEAR MARGARET SAID HE PUTTING ONE HAND ROUND HER WAIST
1686-142278-0032 WHEN GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND WHEN HE WILL IN ANOTHER
1686-142278-0033 IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT AND ORDER TO A CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY
1686-142278-0034 AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE WHICH HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LONG CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING
1686-142278-0035 I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACH THAT WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MIND LESS TORPID OR COWARDLY THAN MINE
1686-142278-0036 IT SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE WENT ON
1686-142278-0037 MARGARET I TRIED TO DO IT I TRIED TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THE ADDITIONAL PREFERMENT AND STOPPING QUITE HERE STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
1686-142278-0038 WHY GOD FORGIVE ME
1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING LOW WORDS OF SELF REPROACH AND HUMILIATIONS OF WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT A FEW
1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLDS SAID BURTHEN WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE

1686-142278-0043 THEY ARE BUT WHAT I HAVE TRIED UPON MYSELF WITHOUT A WELL
1686-142278-0044 THAT MAY BE A TRIAL BUT WORSE FAR WORSE WILL BE THE DEPARTING FROM MY DEAR PEOPLE

1686-142278-0051 SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED AS THE FORCE OF THE BLOW RETURNED UPON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALIZE HOW ANOTHER WILL TAKE IT
1686-142278-0052 TO MILTON NORTHERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DULL INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT THOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENNESS OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER MIND
1686-142278-0053 MILTON JOHNSON
1686-142278-0054 YES ANSWERED HE IN THE SAME DESPONDENT INDIFFERENT WAY
1686-142278-0055 BUT HE WITH HIS QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ IN HER FACE AS IN A MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNING IT OFF WITH AN EFFORT
1686-142278-0056 YOU SHALL BE TOLD THAT MARGARET

1686-142278-0061 MISTER HALE SHOOK HIS HAND DESPONDINGLY HE PRESSED HER HAND IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
1686-142278-0062 MARGARET WAS NEARLY UPSET AGAIN AT A BURST OF CRYING
1686-142278-0063 TO TAKE HER THOUGHTS SHE SAID NOW TELL ME PAPA WHAT OUR PLANS ARE

1701-141759-0001 NOT TILL MIDWINTER WAS THE COUNT AT LAST HANDED A LETTER ADDRESSED IN HIS SISTER'S HANDWRITING
1701-141759-0002 ON RECEIVING IT HE RAN ON TIPTOE TO HIS STUDY IN ALARM AND HASTE TRYING TO ESCAPE NOTICE CLOSED A DOOR AND BEGAN TO READ THE LETTER
1701-141759-0003 EACH TIME THAT THESE HINTS BEGAN TO MAKE THE COUNTESS ANXIOUS AND SHE GLANCED UNEASILY AT THE COUNT THEN AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA THE LATTER VERY ADROITLY TURNED THE CONVERSATION TO INSIGNIFICANT MATTERS
1701-141759-0004 BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE BE CAREFUL YOU KNOW HOW IT MAY AFFECT YOUR DAUGHTER
1701-141759-0005 NO ON MY WORD OF HONOUR SAID NATASHA CROSSING HERSELF I WON'T TELL ANYBODY

1701-141759-0017 SHE BELIEVED IT COULD BE OR DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT
1701-141759-0018 SHALL YOU WRITE TO HIM SHE ANSWERED
1701-141759-0019 NOW THAT HE WAS ALREADY AN OFFICER AND A WOUNDED HERO WOULD IT BE RIGHT TO REMIND HIM OF HERSELF AND AS IT MIGHT SEEM OF THE OBLIGATIONS TO HER HE HAD TAKEN ON HERSELF
1701-141759-0020 I WOULDN'T KNOW
1701-141759-0021 SONYA CALLS NO
1701-141759-0022 IT'S BECAUSE SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THAT FAT ONE IN SPECTACLES THAT WAS HOW PETYA DESCRIBED HIS NAMESAKE THE NEW COUNT BEZUKHOV AND NOW SHE'S IN LOVE WITH THAT SINGER HE SAID NATASHA'S ITALIAN SINGING MASTER THAT'S WHY SHE'S ASHAMED

1701-141759-0024 THE COUNTESS HAD BEEN SURPRISED BY ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S HINTS AT DINNER
1701-141759-0025 ON RETIRING TO HER OWN ROOM SHE SAT IN AN ARMCHAIR HER EYES FIXED ON A MINIATURE PORTRAIT OF HER SON ON THE LID OF A SNUFF BOX WHILE HER TEARS KEPT COMING INTO HER EYES
1701-141759-0026 THE COUNT PUT HIS EARS TO THE KEY HOLE AND LISTENED
1701-141759-0027 AT FIRST HE HEARD THE SOUND OF INDIFFERENT VOICES THEN ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S VOICE ALONE ON A LONG SPEECH THEN A CRY THEN SILENCE THEN BOTH VOICES TOGETHER WITH GLAD INTONATIONS AND THEN FOOTSTEPS
1701-141759-0028 ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OPENED THE WINDOW
1701-141759-0029 WHEN SHE HEARD THE SONYA BLUSHED SO THAT TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES AND UNABLE TO BEAR THE LOOKS TURNED UPON HER RAN AWAY INTO THE DANCING HALL WHIRLED ROUND IT AT FULL SPEED WITH HER DRESS PUFFED OUT LIKE A BALLOON AND FLUSHED AND SMILING PLUMPED DOWN ON THE FLOOR
1701-141759-0030 THE COUNTESS WAS CALLING
1701-141759-0031 FROM ALL HE SAYS ONE SHOULD BE SAD AND NOT CRY
1701-141759-0032 HOW CHARMINGLY SHE DESCRIBES SAID SHE READING THE DESCRIPTIVE PART OF THE LETTER AND WHAT A SOUL
1701-141759-0033 I ALWAYS SAID WHERE HE WAS ONLY SO HIGH I ALWAYS SAID
1701-141760-0000 THE PAVLOV GRADES HELD FEAST AFTER FEAST CELEBRATING AWARDS THEY HAD RECEIVED FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND MADE EXPEDITIONS TO ORMUDES TO VISIT A CERTAIN CAROLINA HUNGARIAN WHO HAD RECENTLY OPENED A RESTAURANT THERE WITH GIRLS AS WAITRESSES
1701-141760-0001 THE GUARDS HAD MADE THEIR WHOLE MARCH AS IF ON A PLEASURE TRIP PARADING THEM CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE
1701-141760-0002 THE REGIMENTS HAD ENTERED AND LEFT THE TOWN WITH THEIR BANDS PLAYING AND BY THE GRAND DUKE'S ORDERS THE MEN HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY IN STEPPE A PRACTICE IN WHICH THE GUARDS PRIDED THEMSELVES THE OFFICERS ON FOOT AND AT THEIR PROPER POSTS
1701-141760-0003 BORIS HAD BEEN QUARTERING AND HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY WITH BERG WHO WAS ALREADY IN COMMAND OF A COMPANY
1701-141760-0004 BORIS DURING THE CAMPAIGN HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MANY PERSONS WHO MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO HIM AND BY A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION HE HAD BROUGHT FROM PIERRE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI THE WHOM HE HOPED TO OBTAIN A POST ON THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF STAFF
1701-141760-0005 BERG AND BORIS HAVING RESTED AFTER YESTERDAY'S MARCH WERE SITTING CLEAN AND NEATLY DRESSED AT THE ROUND TABLE IN THE CLEAN QUARTERS ALLOTTED TO THEM PLAYING CHESS
1701-141760-0006 WELL HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT HE REMEMBERED
1701-141760-0007 TO THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED
1701-141760-0008 DEAR ME WHY YOU HAVE CHANGED
1701-141760-0009 HE WAS ABOUT TO EMBRACE HIS FRIENDS BUT NICHOLAS AVOIDED HER
1701-141760-0010 HE WANTED TO PINCH HIM PUSH HIM DO ANYTHING BUT KISS HIM A THING EVERYBODY DOES
1701-141760-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS BORIS EMBRACED HIM IN A QUIET WAY AND KISSED HIM THREE TIMES
1701-141760-0012 THEY HAD NOT MET FOR NEARLY HALF A YEAR AND BEING AT THE AGE WHEN YOUNG MEN TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS ON LIFE'S ROAD EACH SAW IMMENSE CHANGES IN THE OTHER QUITE A NEW RECOLLECTION OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN THOSE FIRST STEPS
1701-141760-0013 I DID NOT EXPECT YOU TO BE HE ADDED
1701-141760-0014 YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT THIS IMPERIAL HIGHNESS RODE WITH OUR REGIMENT ALL THE TIME SO THAT WE HAD EVERY COMFORT AND EVERY ADVANTAGE
1701-141760-0015 WHAT RECEPTIONS WE HAD IN HOLANDS

1701-141760-0017 OH YOU GUARDS SAID ROSTOV I MAY SEND FOR SOME WINE

1701-141760-0020 OH DON'T MENTION IT COUNT I QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID BORG LOOKING UP AND SPEAKING IN A MUFFLED AND GUTTURAL VOICE
1701-141760-0021 GO ACROSS TO OUR HOSTS THEY INVITED YOU ANSWERED BORIS
1701-141760-0022 BERG PUT ON THE CLEANEST OF COATS WITHOUT A SPOT OR SPECK OF DUST STOOD BEFORE A LOOKING GLASS AND BRUSHED THE HAIR ON HIS TEMPLES UPWARDS IN THE WAY AFFECTED BY THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF FROM THE WAY ROSTOV LOOKED AT IT THAT HIS COAT HAD BEEN NOTICED LEFT THE HALL WITH A PLEASANT SMILE
1701-141760-0023 WHY DEAR WHAT A BEAST I AM MUTTERED ROSTOV AS HE READ THE LETTER WHY
1701-141760-0024 WELL HAVE YOU SENT GABRIEL FOR SOME WINES ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE SOME
1701-141760-0025 IN A LETTER FROM HIS PARENTS WAS ENCLOSED A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION TO BAGRATION WHICH THE OLD COUNTESS FOR ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S ADVICE HAD OBTAINED THROUGH AN ACQUAINTANCE AND SENT TO HER SON ASKING HIM TO TAKE IT TO ITS DESTINATION AND MAKE USE OF IT
1701-141760-0026 WHY HAVE WE THROWN THAT AWAY ASKED BORIS
1701-141760-0027 IT IS YOUR LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT THE DEVIL DO I WANT IT FOR
1701-141760-0028 HE LOOKED INTENTLY AND INQUIRINGLY IN HIS FRIEND'S EYES EVIDENTLY TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND THE ANSWER TO SOME QUESTION
1701-141760-0029 WOULD YOU BELIEVE ME COUNT I WAS NOT AT ALL ALARMED BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS RIGHT
1701-141760-0030 I CAME FORWARD BERG STOOD UP AND SHOWED HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH A HAND TO HIS CAP AND REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR A FACE TO EXPRESS GREATER RESPECT AND SELF COMPLACENCY THAN HIS DID
1701-141760-0031 WELL HE STORMED AT ME AS THE SAYING IS STORMED AND STAMPED AND STORMED
1701-141760-0032 IT WERE NOT A MATTER OF LIFE BUT RATHER OF DEATH AS THE SAYING IS
1701-141760-0033 ALBANIANS AND DEVILS AND TO LIBERIA SAID BERG WITH A SAGACIOUS SMILE
1701-141760-0034 STILL I REMAINED SILENT IN WHAT DO YOU THINK COUNT
1701-141760-0035 AND NEXT DAY IT WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ORDERS OF THE DAY
1701-141760-0036 THAT'S THE WAY COME SAID BERG LIGHTING HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE
1701-141760-0037 YES THAT WAS FINE SAID ROSTOV LAUGHING
1701-141760-0038 ROSTOV WAS A TRUTHFUL YOUNG MAN AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT HAVE TOLD A DESPERATE LIE
1701-141760-0039 HE BEGAN HIS STORY MEANING TO TELL EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAPPENED BUT IT IMPERCEPTIBLY INVOLUNTARILY AND INEVITABLY HE LAPSED INTO FALSEHOOD
1701-141760-0040 PRINCE ANDREW WHO LIKED TO HELP YOUNG MEN WAS FLATTERED BY BEING ASKED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE AND BEING WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS BORIS WHO HAD MANAGED TO PLEASE HIM THE DAY BEFORE HE LIKED TO DO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WANTED
1701-141760-0041 IN SPITE OF PRINCE ANDREW'S DISAGREEABLE IRONICAL TONE IN SPITE OF THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH ROSTOV FROM HIS FIGHTING ARMY'S POINT OF VIEW REGARDED ALL THESE LITTLE ADJUTANTS ON THE STAFF OF WHOM THE NEWCOMER WAS EVIDENTLY ONE ROSTOV FELT CONFUSED BLUSHED AND BECAME SILENT
1701-141760-0042 BORIS INQUIRED WHAT NEWS THERE MIGHT BE ON THE STAFF AND WHAT WITHOUT INDISCRETION ONE MIGHT ASK ABOUT HER PLANS
1701-141760-0043 WE WILL PROBABLY ADVANCE REPLIED BOLKOVSKI EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO SAY MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER
1701-141760-0044 BORKE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WITH GREAT POLITENESS WHETHER AS WAS RUMOURED THE ALLOWANCE OF FORAGE MONEY TO CAPTAINS OF COMPANIES WOULD BE DOUBLED
1701-141760-0045 I WAS NEVER SAID ROSTOV ANGRILY AS IF INTENDING TO INSULT THE AIDE DE CAMP
1701-141760-0046 WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HE ANSWERED YES THERE ARE MANY STORIES NOW TOLD ABOUT THAT AFFAIR
1701-141760-0047 BUT OUR STORIES OR THE STORIES OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER THE ENEMY'S FIRE
1701-141760-0048 OUR STORIES HAVE SOME WEIGHT BUT LIKE THE STORIES OF THOSE FELLOWS ON THE STAFF WHO GET REWARDS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
1701-141760-0049 HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND YOU BUT DON'T FORGET THAT I DO NOT REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED AND AS A MAN OLDER THAN YOU MY ADVICE IS TO LET THE MATTER DROP
1701-141760-0050 EXCLAIMED PRINCE ANDREW AND WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH HE WENT ON
1701-141760-0051 AND HE WAS STILL MORE ANGRY IN HAVING OMITTED TO SEE IT
1701-141760-0052 HE ORDERED HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND COLDLY TAKING LEAVE OF BORIS RODE OVER
1701-141760-0053 SHOULD HE GO TO HEADQUARTERS NEXT DAY AND CHALLENGE THAT AFFECTING ADJUTANT OR REALLY LET THE MATTER DROP WAS THE QUESTION THAT WORRIED HIM ALL THE WAY
2506-11267-0000 ICY SHORES OF EM DEPART NOT PERHAPS WITHOUT AN INNATE LONGING TOO TO QUIT THE ISLAND ALONG WITH THOSE HAPPY SNOBS

2506-11267-0005 MY LADY MARCHIONESS COMES ON BOARD LOOKS ROUND WITH THAT HAPPY AIR OF MINGLED TENDERNESS AND IMPERTINENCE WHICH DISTINGUISHES HER LADYSHIP AND RUSHES TO HER CARRIAGE FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD MINGLE WITH THE OTHER SNOBS ON DECK
2506-11267-0006 THERE SHE SITS AND WILL BE FULL IN PRIVATE
2506-11267-0007 THE STRAWBERRY LEAVES ON HER CHARIOT PANELS WERE ENGRAVED ON HER LADYSHIP'S HEART

2506-11267-0018 THE NEXT PERSON IS ONE HARK
2506-11278-0000 WHEN A GROSS INSTANCE OF SNOBBISHNESS HAPPENS WHY SHOULD NOT AN INDIGNANT JOURNALIST CALL THE PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THAT DELINQUECY TOO
2506-11278-0001 HOW FOR INSTANCE COULD THAT WONDERFUL CASE OF THE EARL IN MANGEL WURZEL AND HIS BROTHER BE EXAMINED IN THE SNOBBISH POINT OF VIEW

2506-169427-0001 AS THE READER FOR I HATE YOUR RIFTS HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE I NEED NOT SAY MORE TO SATISFY HIM THAT MY HERO COULD NOT GO ON AT THIS RATE WITHOUT SOME SLIGHT EXPERIENCE OF THESE INCIDENTAL MEMENTOES
2506-169427-0002 TO SPEAK THE TRUTH HE HAD WANTONLY INVOLVED HIMSELF IN A MULTITUDE OF SMALL BOOK DEBTS OF THIS STAMP WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING EUGENIUS'S FREQUENT ADVICE HE TOO MUCH DISREGARDED THINKING THAT AS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS CONTRACTED THROUGH ANY MALIGNACY BUT ON THE CONTRARY FROM AN HONESTY OF MIND AND A MERE JOCUNDITY OF HUMOR THEY WOULD ALL OF THEM BE CROSSED OUT IN COURSE
2506-169427-0003 EUGENIUS WOULD NEVER ADMIT THIS AND WOULD OFTEN TELL HIM THAT ONE DAY OR OTHER HE COULD CERTAINLY BE RECKONED WITH AND HE WOULD OFTEN ADD IN AN ACCENT OF SORROWFUL APPREHENSION TO THE UTTERMOST MIGHT
2506-169427-0004 WHAT HAD INCLINED EUGENIUS TO THE SAME OPINION WAS AS FOLLOWS
2506-169427-0005 YORICK FOLLOWED EUGENUS WITH HIS EYES TO THE DOORS HE THEN CLOSED THEM AND NEVER OPENED THEM MORE
2506-169427-0006 ALAS POOR DORIS

3660-172182-0003 ONE WISHED THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE LADY BEST BELOVED BY HIM AND ANOTHER TO THE LADIES WHOM HE LOVED BEST
3660-172182-0004 AND AFTER MIDWAY THEY BEHELD AN UNSHAPELY LITTLE MAN UPON A HORSE AND AFTER HIM A DAME OR A DAMSEL ALSO ON HORSEBACK AND AFTER HER A KNIGHT OF LARGE STATURE BOWED DOWN AND HANGING HIS HEAD LOW AND SORROWFULLY AND CLAD IN BROKEN AND WORTHLESS ARMOUR
3660-172182-0005 I KNOW NOT WHO THEY ARE SAID HE BUT I KNOW SAID GUENEVER THIS IS THE KNIGHT WHOM JERRAINE PURSUED AND METHINKS THAT HE COMES NOT HERE BY HIS OWN FREE WILL
3660-172182-0006 BUT DURANT HAS OVERTAKEN HIM AND AVENGED THE INSULT TO A MAIDEN TO THE UTTERMOST
3660-172182-0007 LADY SAID HE AT THE GATE THERE WAS A KNIGHT AND I SAW NEVER A MAN OF SO FEARFUL AN ASPECT TO LOOK UPON AS HE
3660-172182-0008 I DO SAID HE HE TELLS ME THAT HE IS EXEDERIN THE SON OF NUD
3660-172182-0009 THEN SHE REPEATED I KNOW HIM NOT
3660-172182-0010 SO GUENEVER WENT TO A GATE TO MEET HIM AND HE ENTERED
3660-172182-0011 AND DURRANT GREETS THEE WELL AND IN GREETING THEE HE COMPELLED ME TO COME HITHER TO DO THY PLEASURE FOR THE INSULT WHICH THY MAIDENS RECEIVED FROM THE DWARF NOW WHERE DID HE OVERTAKE THEE

3660-172182-0016 THE MERCY WHICH THOU DECLAREST LORD SAID SHE WILL I GRANT TO HIM SINCE IT IS AS INSULTING TO THEE THAT AN INSULT SHOULD BE OFFERED TO ME AS TO THYSELF
3660-172182-0017 THUS WILL IT BE BEST TO DO SAID ARTHUR LET THIS MAN HAVE MEDICAL CARE UNTIL IT BE KNOWN WHETHER HE CAN LIVE
3660-172182-0018 TO GUENEVER AND HER HANDMAIDENT SAID HE
3660-172182-0019 BUT THE STEWARD OF THE HOUSEHOLD SO ORDERED HER
3660-172182-0020 AND BEING YOUNG HE CHANGED HIMSELF AND GREW TO HATE THE SIN THAT SEEMED SO LIKE HIS OWN OF MODRED ATHA'S NEPHEW AND FELL AT LAST IN THE GREAT BATTLE FIGHTING FOR A KING
3660-172182-0021 AND WHEN DURAIN CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE GUENEVER WAS HE SALUTED HER
3660-172182-0022 WHEN THEY WENT IN AND DISMOUNTED
3660-172182-0023 HEAVEN PROTECT THEE SAID ARTHUR AND THE WELCOME OF HEAVEN BE TO THEE
3660-172182-0024 AND INASMUCH AS THOU HAST VANQUISHED EDDIRIN THE SON OF NUD THOU HAST HAD A PROSPEROUS CAREER
3660-172182-0025 OR FROM THAT TIME SHE BECAME HIS WIFE
3660-172182-0026 BUT THE MAIDEN TOOK UP HER ABODE IN THE PALACE AND SHE HAD MANY COMPANIONS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND THERE WAS NO MAIDEN MORE ESTEEMED THAN SHE IN THE ISLAND OF BRITAIN
3660-172182-0027 AND A YEAR AND A SECOND AND A THIRD HE PURSUED THUS UNTIL HIS FAME HAD FLOWN OVER THE FACE OF THE KINGDOM
3660-172182-0028 AND HE GREETS THEE ALL AS AN UNCLE SHOULD GREET HIS NEPHEW AND AS A VASSAL SHOULD GREET HIS LORD
3660-172182-0029 AND THE NEIGHBOURING CHIEFS SEEING THIS GROW INSOLENT TOWARD HIM AND COVERT HIS LAND AND POSSESSIONS
3660-172182-0030 AND ARTHUR TOLD DURRANT THE CAUSE OF THE MISSION AND OF THE COMING OF THE AMBASSADORS TO HIM OUT OF CORNWALL TRULY SAID DURRAT BE IT TO MY ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE LORD I WILL DO ACCORDING TO THY WILL CONCERNING THIS EMBASSY
3660-172182-0031 WHAT DISCOURSES SAID GWENEVER DO I HEAR BETWEEN YOU
3660-172182-0032 SAID JORAINT I THINK I SHALL HAVE ENOUGH OF KNIGHTHOOD WITH ME AND THEY SET FORTH
3660-172182-0033 AND NEVER WAS THERE SEEN A FAIRER HOST JOURNEYING TOWARDS THE SEVERNE
3660-172182-0034 AND HE SAID TO DURRANT I AM A FEEBLE AND AN AGED MAN AND WHILST I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE RELATIONS FOR THEE AND FOR MYSELF I DID SO
3660-172182-0035 AND EVERY MAN ASKED THAT WHICH HE DESIRED
3660-172182-0036 AND THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GIVING SO EAGER WAS EVERY ONE TO BESTOW GIFTS AND OF THOSE WHO COME TO ASK GIFTS NONE DEPARTED UNSATISFIED
3660-172182-0037 THEN NERAINE SENT EMBASSES TO THE MEN OF CORNWALL TO ASK THEM MISS
3660-172182-0038 AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WOULD BE A FULNESS OF JOY AND HONOUR TO THEM FOR DURIN TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR HOMAGE
3660-172182-0039 SO HE HAD RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF SUCH AS WERE THERE
3660-172182-0040 AT THE DAY AFTER THE FOLLOWERS OF ARTHUR INTENDED TO GO AWAY
3660-172183-0000 DURRAINT AS HE HAD BEEN USED TO DO WHEN HE WAS AT ARTHUR'S COURT FREQUENTED TOURNAMENT
3660-172183-0001 BEFORE DURAGINT THE SCOURGE OF THE ENEMY I SAW STEEDS WHITE WITH FOAM AND AFTER THE SHOUT OF BATTLE A FEARFUL TORRENT
3660-172183-0002 THESE TIDINGS CAME TO URBAN AND
3660-172183-0003 AND I BY MY CONFESSION UNTO HEAVEN SAID SHE THERE IS NOTHING MORE HATEFUL UNTO ME THAN THIS
3660-172183-0004 THE TEARS SHE SAID AND THE WORDS SHE HAD SPOKEN WOKE HIM
3660-172183-0005 AN EVIL BETIDE ME SAID HE IF THOU RETURNEST HERE UNTIL THOU KNOWST WHETHER I HAVE LOST MY STRENGTH SO COMPLETELY AS THOU DIDST SAY
3660-172183-0006 THEN JERRAINE WENT TO SEE URBAN
3660-172183-0007 SIR SAID HE I AM GOING UPON THIS QUEST AND I AM NOT CERTAIN WHEN I MAY COME BACK
3660-172183-0008 TAKE HEED THEREFORE UNTO THY CUSTOMS UNTIL MY RETURN
3660-172183-0009 BUT ONE PERSON ONLY WILL GO WITH YOU
3660-172183-0010 AND HE DARED ENID TO MOUNT HER HORSE AND TO RIDE FORWARD AND TO KEEP A LONG WAY BEFORE HIM
3660-172183-0011 AND UNLESS I SPEAK UNTO THEE SAY NOT THOU ONE WORD OTHERWISE
3660-172183-0012 BUT THOUGH THOU SHOULDST DESIRE TO SEE MY DEFEAT AND MY DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THOSE MEN YET DO I FEEL NO DREAD
3660-172183-0013 AND IT RECEIVED HIM AND THAT NOT FEEBLY
3660-172183-0014 AND SAY NOT ONE WORD UNTO ME UNLESS I SPEAK THUS UNTO THEE
3660-172183-0015 I WILL DO AS FAR AS I CAN LADY SAID SHE ACCORDING TO THY DESIRE
3660-172183-0016 AH MAIDS SAID HE IT IS VAIN TO ATTEMPT PROCEEDING FORWARD
3660-172183-0017 I CANNOT BY ANY MEANS REFRAIN FROM SLEEP THROUGH WEARINESS SAID HE DO NOT THEREFORE WATCH THE HORSES AND SLEEP NOT
3660-172183-0018 AND WHEN SHE SAW THE DAWN OF DAY APPEARED SHE LOOKED AROUND HER TO SEE IF HE WERE WAKING AND THEREUPON HE WOKE
3660-172183-0019 AND THEY LEFT THE WOOD AND THEY CAME TO AN OPEN COUNTRY WITH MEADOWS ON ONE HAND AND MOANS MOWING THE MEADOWS
3660-172183-0020 MY LORD HE ADDED WILL IT BE DISPLEASING TO THEE IF I ASK WHENCE THOU COME'ST ALSO
3660-172183-0021 WILT THOU FOUL MY COUNSEL SAID THE YOUTH AND TAKE MY MEAL FROM ME
3660-172183-0022 WHAT SORT OF MEAL HE EMPLOYED
3660-172183-0023 THUS THEY WASHED AND TOOK THEIR REPAST
3660-172183-0024 I GO OUT LORD SAID HE TO MEET THE KNIGHT AND TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS LODGING
3660-172183-0025 I WILL DO IT SAID SHE AS THOU SAYEST
3660-172183-0026 AND AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRANK JORAINE WENT TO SLEEP AND SO DID ENID ALSO
3660-6517-0000 THE DATES SEEM UNIMPORTANT BUT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE SHIP HAVE BEEN UNREMITTINGLY BUSY
3660-6517-0001 BOWERS ATTACKED THE SHIP'S STORES SURVEYED RELISTED AND RESTOWED THEM SAVING VERY MUCH SPACE BY UNSTOWING NUMEROUS CASES AND STOWING THE CONTENTS INTO THE LAZARETTE
3660-6517-0002 WITHOUT STREAM THE LEAK CAN NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH THE HAND PUMP BY TWO DAILY EFFORTS OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES
3660-6517-0003 AS THE SHIP WAS AND IN HER PRESENT HEAVILY LADEN CONDITION IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE OR FOUR HOURS EACH WAY
3660-6517-0004 THE LARGE GREEN TENT IS PUT UP AND PROPER SUPPORTS MADE FOR IT
3660-6517-0005 THE ENGINE ROOM STAFF AND ANDERSEN'S PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOWING THEIR LABORATORIES THE COOK REFITTING HIS GALLEY AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD HIS BAND OF WORKERS
3660-6517-0006 THE SUN'S SPACE SUCH AS IT IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FORE HATCH TO THE STEM ON THE MAIN DECK
3660-6517-0007 UNDER THE FORECASTLE ARE STALLS OF FIFTEEN PONIES THE MAXIMUM SPACE WOULD HOLD THE NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT WAS PACKED TIGHT WITH FODDER
3660-6517-0008 IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FORECASTLE BOXADE IS A SMALL BOOBY HATCH THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE MEN'S MESS DECK IN BAD WEATHER
3660-6517-0009 ABAFT THE FORE HATCH IS THE MAIN HOUSE
3660-6517-0010 WE MANAGED TO GET THREE TONS OF ICE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO CARCASES OF MUTTON AND THREE COUCASSES OF BEEF BESIDES SOME BOXES OF SWEETBREADS AND KIDNEYS INTO THIS SPACE
3660-6517-0011 THE SACKS CONTAINING THIS LAST ADDED TO THE GOODS ALREADY MENTIONED MAKE A REALLY HEAVY DECK CAGO AND ONE IS NATURALLY ANXIOUS CONCERNING IT BUT EVERY THING THAT CAN BE DONE BY LASHING AND SECURING HAS BEEN DONE
3660-6517-0012 FORAGE I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIRTY TONS OF COMPRESSED OAT AND HAY TO MELBOURNE
3660-6517-0013 THIS SCENE IS WHOLLY ENCHANTING AND SUCH A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER IN A GARDEN WHICH BLAZES WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION WITH ALL THINGS
3660-6517-0014 A GREAT MASS OF PEOPLE ESTABLISHED
3660-6517-0015 KAY AND I LUNCH WITH A PARTY OF THE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY'S SHIP RUPAHOO
3660-6517-0016 TELEGRAM TO SAY TERANOVA HAD ARRIVED SUNDAY NIGHT
3660-6517-0017 A THIRD SLEDGE STANDS ACROSS THE BREAK OF THE POOP IN THE SPACE HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY THE AFTER GUNCH
3660-6517-0018 THE QUANTITY IS TWO AND A HALF TONS AND THIS SPACE OCCUPIED CONSIDERABLE
3660-6517-0019 THE SHIP WAS OVER TWO FEET WITH THE STERN BUT THIS WILL SOON BE REMEDIED
3660-6517-0020 THEY MUST PERFORCE BE CHAINED UP AND THEY ARE GIVEN WHAT SHELTER IS AFFORDED ON DECK FOR THEIR POSITION IS NOT ENVIABLE
3660-6517-0021 IT IS A PATHETIC ATTITUDE DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY OCCASIONALLY SOME POOR BEAST AND EMITS A LONG PATHETIC WHINE
3660-6517-0022 THERE ARE GENERALLY ONE OR TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASILYS MATTERS BUT IT IS A SQUASH
3660-6517-0023 LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND HAS VEERED TO THE WESTWARD HEADING IT SLIGHTLY
3660-6517-0024 OATS AND ATKINSON WITH INTERMITTENT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHERS WERE BUSY KEEPING THE PONIES ON THEIR LEGS
3660-6517-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EVIL AND NEARLY ALL HANDS WERE LABORING FOR HOURS ON THE WAIST OF THE SHIP HEAVING COAL SACKS OVERBOARD AND RELASHING THE PETROL CASES ET CETERA IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
3660-6517-0026 NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED THAN SOME EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY WAVE WOULD TEAR AWAY THAT LASHING AND THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN
3660-6517-0027 AT THIS MOMENT ABOUT FOUR A M THE ENGINE ROOM BECAME THE CENTRE OF INTEREST
3660-6517-0028 THE WATER HAD GAINED IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT
3660-6517-0029 THE OUTLOOK APPEARED DISMAL
3660-6517-0030 THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT WAS BEING MADE WITH THE SHIP SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS MOST UNCERTAIN
3660-6517-0031 WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW FIRE OR WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
3660-6517-0032 THE BILAGE PUMP IS DEPENDENT ON THE SAME ENGINE
3660-6517-0033 ON ONE OCCASION I WAS WAIST DEEP WHEN STANDING ON THE RAILING OF THE POOP
3660-6517-0034 THE AFTERGUARD WERE ORGANIZED IN TWO PARTIES BY EVANS TO WORK BUCKETS THE MEN WERE KEPT STEADILY GOING ON THE CHOKED HAND PUMPS THIS SEEMED ALL THAT COULD BE DONE FOR THE MOMENT AND WHAT A MEASURE TO ACT AS THE SOLE SAFEGUARD OF THE SHIP FROM SINKING PRACTICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BAIL HER OUT
3660-6517-0035 OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD BEAR ONE OF THEM AWAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED WITH HIS CHAIN
3663-172005-0000 THE FAUN HAD TAKEN THIS MORNING MEAL AND NOW LAY CURLED UP ON A BED OF MOSS
3663-172005-0001 WHENEVER THE FAWN CAUGHT UP HE WAS QUITE CONTENT TO FRISK ABOUT IT
3663-172005-0002 HIS DANGER WAS CERTAIN NOW IT WAS NEAR
3663-172005-0003 THE HOUNDS HAD STRUCK A TRAIL WHERE WE TURNED AND THE FAWN WAS SAFE
3663-172005-0004 ONE WAS ROWING THE OTHER HAD A GUN ON HIS HAND WHAT SHOULD SHE DO
3663-172005-0005 HER TIRED LEGS COULD NOT PROPEL THE TINY BODY RAPIDLY
3663-172005-0006 THE DOLL SAW THE BOAT NEARING HER
3663-172005-0007 IN A MOMENT MORE THE BOAT WAS ON HER AND THE MEN WITH THE OARS HAD LEANED OVER AND CAUGHT HER
3663-172528-0000 I WAS TORMENTED BY THIRST BUT HE HAD ABSTAINED FROM DRINKING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS
3663-172528-0001 THAT OLD MAN CEASED TO GIVE SO MUCH ANNOYANCE YES SOMETIMES HE APPEARED TO ME IN DREAMS
3663-172528-0002 FELICIA GIVEN THEM NOT TO SPEAK TO ME OF THIS
3663-172528-0003 THIS MAID HAD STOLEN FOR ME CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND IN HER FEAR OF BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD DIED
3663-172528-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE ASKED ME TWICE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FULL I THEN COVERED MYSELF AND BEGAN TO SWEAT AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
3663-172528-0005 THEY SAY THAT MY YOUNG FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO GRIEVED WAS HE TO HEAR THIS
3663-172528-0006 AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY STICK AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE SERVING GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT SHOUTING OUT AH TRAITRESS YOU HAVE KILLED HIM FOR ME THEN
3663-172528-0007 SHE MAY INDEED HAVE SAVED MY LIFE SO LEND ME A HELPING HAND FOR I HAVE SWEATED AND BEEN QUICK ABOUT IT
3663-172528-0008 FELICIA RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS DRIED IT MADE ME COMFORTABLE AND I BEING CONSCIOUS OF A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN MY STATE BEGAN TO RECKON ON RECOVERY
3663-172528-0009 JUST THEN THE OTHER DOCTOR BERNARDITO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAD REFUSED TO BLEED ME
3663-172528-0010 MAESTRO FRANCESCO THAT MOST ABLE MAN CRIED OH POWER OF NATURE
3663-172528-0011 SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE CHRISTIANS KNOW NOTHING
3663-172528-0012 THE SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER SAYING IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED ON THE SPOT
3663-172528-0013 AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE RUN MORE WATER
3663-172528-0014 I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED THE THIRST
3663-172528-0015 IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED TOO TO BLEED HIM
3663-172528-0016 IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF THE WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE
3663-172528-0017 SHE MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HIS CURE
3663-172528-0018 AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE
3663-172528-0019 THAT VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS ON A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD
3663-172528-0020 DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME IN ANOTHER DISORDER THEN WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM
3663-172528-0021 THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA OF YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE
3663-172528-0022 SO I MADE MY MIND OFF AND PREPARED TO TRAVEL
3663-172528-0023 THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIERRE LADY WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
3663-172528-0024 NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE IGUTTO WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
3663-172528-0025 I HAVE HARBOURED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS
3663-172528-0026 MEANTIME THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DA MONTEVARCHI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL
3663-172528-0027 THEN THEY SEATED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY
3663-172528-0028 MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS AND SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE
3663-172528-0029 AT THESE WORDS MAESTRO AGOSTINO THE DUKE'S TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THAT VERY MOMENT
3663-172528-0030 GIORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MYASTHRO AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED THERE IS A MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NOT
3663-172528-0031 AS FIERCELY AS I COULD NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED GEORGJO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0032 HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO AND THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THE KIND
3663-172528-0033 MAESTRO AGOSTINO RETORTED YOU GALLOWS
3663-172528-0034 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT FOR JUST CERTAIN
3663-172528-0035 GEORGEL MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0036 THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND THEY HALTED
3663-172528-0037 THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MARVELLED I WAS STILL ALIVE AFTERWARDS HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE A HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH
3663-172528-0038 WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTE AH GUTTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME
3663-172528-0039 I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND TOLD HIM ALL THE AFFAIR ABOUT THE MINTS
3663-172528-0040 HE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE YOUR VENGEANCE EXECUTIONED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT
3663-172528-0041 I THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIETRO PAGOLO ADVICE ABOUT STAMPING THE COINS AND THEN WENT OFF ON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE DUKE OR ANYONE ELSE
3663-172528-0042 YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALIZE YOU FEROCIOUS TYRANT
3663-172528-0043 YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXCLUSIVE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS
3663-172528-0044 IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT KING ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENT
3663-172528-0045 MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE GYES FOR THAT MEDAL
3663-172528-0046 I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE
3663-172528-0047 I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENZIO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL
3663-172528-0048 NICCOLO DA MONTERE GUTTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENZANO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
3663-172528-0049 NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I WOULD BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
3663-172528-0050 I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED MY WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY
3663-172528-0051 THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOR HE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED
3663-172528-0052 I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE PUT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL
3663-172528-0053 I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK ON TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING
3663-172528-0054 I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FROM ROME
3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILK ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE
3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT IS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE
3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADES THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF COUANA
3915-57461-0003 HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED AND FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED
3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PRISONERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM
3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THAT THE ROAN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPEN TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
3915-57461-0006 NOW UNLESS BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE
3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO SWEETLY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM
3915-57461-0008 THEN THE ROANON SAID TO THE BOWMAN
3915-57461-0009 WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER CHAMBERS
3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONAM HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONON OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO QUAYOTO
3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WOMAN WHO BORE HIM A CHILD
3915-57461-0013 SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME IF HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF
3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THAT GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR
3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TOKOBAY FELT ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERY MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME
3915-57461-0016 NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT CITY
3915-57461-0017 AND HIDING HIS FEET UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER
3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO AT THE KEANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT
3915-57461-0019 HAPLEY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART
3915-57461-0020 IN MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MARVELLOUS AILMENT
3915-57461-0021 SEEING I COULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
3915-57461-0022 AND WOULD IT NOT ALL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALICE
3915-57461-0023 REPENT THEREFORE AND ABANDON YOUR EAGER WAYS
3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THE HEART OF HAPPINESS
3915-57461-0025 BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK YOU IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TORMENT YOU
3915-57461-0026 IN A FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROB ME
3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN BUT THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOME DAY OVERTAKE ME
3915-57461-0028 HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR BROTHER AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL
3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW THEY MANAGE TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
3915-57461-0030 THE GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT
3915-98647-0000 EVERY WELL ORDERED JAPANESE HOUSE OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTRE OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOUSE
3915-98647-0001 SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY AND ANNIVERSARY SCENE THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS
3915-98647-0002 THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHER AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILDREN LIFE
3915-98647-0003 VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITIONS FOR THE CHILD'S COLLECTION
3915-98647-0004 ALL THESE WERE PUT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT THE CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SONS
3915-98647-0005 AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR NATURAL OWNERS AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE
3915-98647-0006 EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KINDS OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILFUL BALANCER OF PROSE AND KHANS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE
3915-98647-0007 FOR THE LATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE THE HOME PROPHECIES ARE FELT TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN AND THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED IN
3915-98647-0008 NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOORS
3915-98647-0009 AFTER THIS MATTER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE HAS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS
3915-98647-0010 OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHEN THE WOLF IS RAISED
3915-98647-0011 THE HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER A DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
3915-98647-0012 A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABORERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE RIDGEPOLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCRAMBLE JOYFULLY
3915-98647-0013 ALL COME WHO CAN AND THESE WHO CANNOT COME SEND SERVANTS OR PROVISIONS
3915-98647-0014 ON THE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN A CASKE SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS THE STYLE COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN
3915-98647-0015 NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR AROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES A SURVIVAL OF AN OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE
3915-98647-0016 AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THEIR RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE
3915-98647-0017 THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITE OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL
3915-98647-0018 UPON HIS YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL THE LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS
3915-98647-0019 WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IT WAS DRESSED IN WHITE AND SILK HABO TIE WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT
3915-98647-0020 THE BODY TOO BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES A POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS
3915-98647-0021 THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THE COFFIN THE NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THAT THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD
3915-98647-0022 THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEAST THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH
3915-98647-0023 LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THAT COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF TEA
3915-98647-0024 SO LONG AS THE ELEPHANT IS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY
3915-98647-0025 IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING FOR THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES
3915-98647-0026 THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES
3915-98647-0027 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF ITS CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED
3915-98647-0028 A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUKKASWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING
3915-98647-0029 IN HIS WILL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING IN THE CLEARING IN WHICH HE DIED
3915-98647-0030 FROM THIS GROWING FEELING AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES
3915-98647-0031 JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THE PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY
3915-98647-0032 ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MEN TO CARRY IT
3915-98647-0033 SOMETIMES WITH THE GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THAT FUNERAL TRAIN
3915-98647-0034 ANOTHER FAVOURITE VISITOR AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON
3915-98647-0035 IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THEN A BURIAL
3915-98647-0036 DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE BUT A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET UP IN THE DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY
4153-185072-0000 HE TARRIED AT GUNNESHAW A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP TO GADOL WHERE I THEN RESIDED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE WINTER CAME ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS STAY
4153-185072-0001 THE ENRAGED HUSBAND WELL KNOWING THAT HE MUST FEEL A BLOW IF HE WAITED TO HEAR THE ORDER REPEATED INSTANTLY RETREATED AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS CATTLE
4153-185072-0002 WE PROTECTED THE POOR NATTICOKE WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUALS AND ALLAN SYMPATHISED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES TILL SPRING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE PROMISED A REFORMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OF RENEWAL OF HER AFFECTION
4153-185072-0003 THE INDIANS WERE SOON ASKED BY THE AMERICAN OFFICER THAT THE WAMPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS ARDENTLY WISHED FOR
4153-185072-0004 MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ALAN'S HORSE AND CARRIED THE GOOD
4153-185072-0005 ALLEYNE ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMY HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT OF HIS RETURN THEY WERE SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTLE'S WHO MARRIED PRISCILLA RAMSAY WITH A SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM
4153-185072-0006 NETTLES AT LENGTH ABANDONING THE CHASE WENT HOME AND AILEEN ALL IN TATTERS CAME IN
4153-185072-0007 BY RUNNING TO THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO RAGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SUFFERING CONDITION ALMOST NAKED
4153-185072-0008 ALLEYNE MADE HIS TROUSERS HIMSELF AND THEN BUILT A RAFT ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MONT MAURICE
4153-185072-0009 THERE AN INDIAN GAVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A NEW GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE BEARDSTOWN WHERE HE FOUND HIS SQUAW
4153-185072-0010 NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THAT PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GUDO
4153-185072-0011 HIS LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SWIFTNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE TO HIS FORMER CASTLE OF SAFETY
4153-185072-0012 HIS PURSUERS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETED AND UNDER PROTECTION
4153-185072-0013 STILL UNSATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THEY ADVISED MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME THE SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDERED OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT TO MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF THEIR SITUATION AND FINALLY THEY LEFT ME
4153-185072-0014 HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOKE ME WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION FEARING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEMY MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN AND IN A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
4153-185072-0015 AT THAT TIME ALAN LAY ON A SECRET PLACE IN THE GULF A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FLATS IN A HOLE THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER
4153-186222-0000 THERE IS LITTLE DANGER IN THIS QUARTER I'M SURE SO I MAY AS WELL BE FRIENDS WITH HER POOR CHILD
4153-186222-0001 I AH WHY NOT
4153-186222-0002 BETH HESITATE
4153-186222-0003 THE LETTER ASKING YOU TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAVE EVER RECEIVED FROM HER
4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE SHE ASKED ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND WOULD WISH TO BECOME FRIENDLY AND SO I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
4153-186222-0005 SURELY TWO GIRLS WILL HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS LONELY OLD PALACE THAN ONE COULD HAVE ALONE
4153-186222-0006 OH YES SHE HAS HE CORRECTED LOUISE
4153-186222-0007 DO YOU MEAN PATRICIA DOYLE YES
4153-186222-0008 NOW WE MAY CONCLUDE SHE'S LEFT OUT OF THE ARRANGEMENT SAID BETH CALMLY
4153-186222-0009 YOU'LL FIGHT FOR YOUR OWN HANDS AND FIGHT MIGHTY HARD
4153-186222-0010 WHY MY DEAD COUSIN I DON'T WANT AUNT JANE'S MONEY
4153-186222-0011 MY MOTHER AND I ARE AMPLY PROVIDED FOR AND I AM ONLY HERE TO FIND REST IN MY SOCIAL DUTIES AND TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH MY DEAD FATHER'S SISTER THAT IS ALL
4153-186222-0012 MY MOTHER TEACHES MUSIC AND MOTHER SCOLDS HIM CONTINUALLY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT
4153-186222-0013 WE'VE NEVER SEEN A CENT OF HER MONEY ALTHOUGH THE FATHER HAS TRIED AT TIMES TO BORROW ENOUGH TO HELP HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
4153-186222-0014 I EVEN KISSED HER WHEN SHE ASKED ME TO AND I SENT A SHIVER ALL DOWN MY BACK
4153-186222-0015 FOR MY PART I AM FOND OF EVERY BODY AND IT DELIGHTS ME TO FUSS AROUND INVALIDS AND ASSIST THEM
4153-186222-0016 YOU SAY YOU'D LIKE TO CARE FOR IN MILL'S AND I DON'T
4153-186222-0017 YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME THINK YOU DON'T WANT ELMHURST WHEN YOU'RE AS ANXIOUS TO GET IT AS I AM
4153-186222-0018 THEY CALL ME BETH SULLENLY AND
4153-186222-0019 I DON'T LIVE IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW
4153-186222-0020 BUT SUPPOSE SHE LEAVES IT WITH YOU PERSISTED BET
4153-186222-0021 LOUISE WISHED TO MEDITATE
4153-186222-0022 IT'S A MAGNIFICENT ESTATES SAID BETH LOOKING AT HER COUSIN DOUBTFULLY
4153-186222-0023 NOW SHALL YOU BE FRIENDS SHE ASKED LIGHTLY
4153-186222-0024 TO BE SURE I COULD WANT YOU TO MY DEAR
4153-186222-0025 SUCH A GIRL FRIEND IT HAD NEVER BEEN HER PRIVILEGE TO BE BEFORE AND WHEN HER SUSPICIONS WERE FORGOTTEN SHE BECAME FAIRLY RESPONSIVE AND BRIGHTENED WONDERFULLY
4153-186222-0026 SILAS SHE SAID WHEN HE ENTERED WHAT D YOU THINK OF MY NIECES
4153-186222-0027 THEY ARE VERY CHARMING GIRLS HE ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THEY ARE AT AN AGE WHERE FEW GIRLS SHOW TO GOOD ADVANTAGE
4153-186222-0028 WHY DID YOU NOT INVITE FENNES TO DINNER JANE THE BOY
4153-186222-0029 AND HE IS CONSTANTLY SAYING DISAGREEABLE THINGS
4153-186222-0030 VERY WELL SAID THE LAWYER QUIETLY WHICH OF MY NIECES DO YOU REQUIRE
4153-186222-0031 ASKED THE OLD LADY AFTER A PAUSE I CANNOT SAY IN SO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE HE ANSWERED WITH GRAVITY WHICH DO YOU PREFER JANE
4153-186222-0032 AND THEY ARE EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY SHE ANSWERED
4153-186222-0033 I CANNOT IMAGINE ELMHURST BELONGING TO EITHER SLAS
4153-186222-0034 I MUST HAVE THAT OTHER NIECE THE ONE WHO DEFIES ME AND REFUSES TO ANSWER MY SECOND LETTER
4153-186222-0035 THERE WOULD BE A DOZEN WARS TO FIGHT FOR MY MONEY AND DEAR OLD ELMHURST WOULD BE SOLD TO STRANGERS SHE RESUMED WITH BITTERNESS
4153-186223-0000 IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE ROOM KENNETH FORBES SQUATTED UPON A DESK WITH AN EMPTY PINE BOX HELD CARELESSLY IN HIS LAP
4153-186223-0001 WHILE DUNCAN WORKED THE BOY WAS BUSY WITH HIS PENCIL BUT NEITHER HAD SPOKEN FOR AT LEAST A HALF HOURS
4153-186223-0002 THEN RIDING SLOWLY UP THE HEDGE BORDERED ROAD HIS TROUBLES ONCE MORE ASSAILED HIM AND HE WONDERED IF THERE WAS NOT SOME SPOT UPON THE BROAD EARTH TO WHICH HE COULD FLY FROM RETIREMENT UNTIL THE GIRLS HAD LEFT ELMHURST FOR GOOD
4153-186223-0003 NORAH SHIED AND HE LOOKED UP TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAD NEARLY RUN DOWN A PEDESTRIAN A STOUT LITTLE MAN WITH THE BUNDLE UNDER HIS ARM WHO HELD UP ONE HAND AS IF TO ARREST HIM
4153-186223-0004 WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO ASKED THE LADY
4153-186223-0005 THEN IT'S THE SAME JANE AS EVER HE RESPONDED WITH THE SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
4153-186223-0006 DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT OF HOPED SHE'D RETURNED AND I'D BE GLAD TO SEE HER AGAIN THEY TELL ME SHE'S GOT MONEY
4153-186223-0007 AUNT JANE'S RICH AUNT JANEY
4153-186223-0008 ECHOED THE MAN QUICKLY WHAT' YOU NAME LAD
4153-186223-0009 DON'T LIKE GIRLS I KNOW IT
4153-186223-0010 ANOTHER LONG PAUSE THEN THE BOY SUDDENLY SAID QUESTIONER
4153-186223-0011 YOU KNOW THAT MISS MERRICK SIR
4153-186223-0012 I USED TO WHEN WE WERE QUITE YOUNGER
4153-186223-0013 KENNETH STOPPED SHORT AND THE MAYOR STARTED AND THE LITTLE MAN WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT ALSO STOPPED
4153-186223-0014 JOHN MERRICK THAT S ME
4153-186223-0015 YOU AND THE TINSMITH
4153-186223-0016 THEY KEPT TRACK OF HER BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY BECAME RICH AND A GREAT LADY AND THAT WAS A SURPRISING THING TO HAPPEN TO EMERRICK
4153-186223-0017 THANK YOU LAD RETURNED THE MAN GRATEFULLY I THOUGHT A LITTLE EXERCISE WOULD DO ME GOOD BUT THIS THREE MILES HAS SEEMS LIKE THIRTY TO ME
4153-186223-0018 I WILL SAID THE KING
4153-186223-0019 THE LAWYER TURNED AWAY BUT IN A MOMENT HALTED AGAIN
4153-186223-0020 HIS INTEREST IN MISS JANE'S BROTHER ANNE WAS EXTRAORDINARY
4153-61735-0000 THEY ARE BUT LUKEWARM LOVERS WHO CAN CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH A DIALOGUE CARRIED ON AT BEAUSART DISTANCE
4153-61735-0001 IF THERE BE NO ELYSIUM ON EARTH IT IS THIS
4153-61735-0002 HIS OWN DAUGHTER HIS ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE BEST BLOOD OF SOUTHERN ARISTOCRACY BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING TO SECURE HIM A SPLENDID ALLIANCE HOLDING IN KNIGHTLY ASSIGNATION WITH A HORSE HUNTER
4153-61735-0003 HE COULD WELL CONCEDE SO MUCH TO HER CAPRICE SINCE HER STAYING AT HOME WOULD BE NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE CAUSE THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO THE STERN COUNSEL
4153-61735-0004 IT IS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THIS ROUTE PASSED THE HACIENDA OF CASA DEL CORVO AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER
4153-61735-0005 ON REACHING THE COPSE HE DISMOUNTED LED HIS HORSE IN AMONG THE UNDERWOOD HITCHED HIM BY LOOPING HIS BRIDLE REIN AROUND THE TOPMOST TWIGS OF AN ELASTIC BOW THEN DETACHING A LONG ROPE OF TWISTED HORSEHAIR FROM THE HORN OF HIS SADDLE AND INSERTING HIS ARM INTO ITS COIL HE GLIDED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND ON THE SIDE THAT LAY TOWARD THE HACIENDA
4153-61735-0006 BEFORE FORSAKING THE SHADOW OF THE CORPSE HE CAST A GLANCE TOWARD THE SKY AND AT THE MOON SAILING PURELY OVER IT
4153-61735-0007 THAT DROLL CONCEIT WHICH HAS SO OFT AMUSED THE NOCTURNAL INEBRIATE OF GREAT CITIES APPEARED TO PRODUCE A LIKE EFFECT UPON THE NIGHT PATROLLER OF THE PRAIRIE AND FOR A MOMENT THE SHADOW LATE DARKENING HIS BROW DISAPPEARED
4153-61735-0008 IT'S NOT LIKELY BUT THEY ARE UNLESS IT BE THE OWNER OF A BAD CONSCIENCE WHO CAN'T SLEEP
4153-61735-0009 TROTH THERE'S ONE SUCH WITHIN THOSE WINDOWS
4153-61735-0010 IF HE BE ABROAD THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF HIS SEEING ME ON THE OPEN GROUND NOT THAT I SHOULD CARE A STRAW IF IT WERE ONLY I MYSELF TO BE COMPROMISED
4153-61735-0011 IT'S NO USE WAITING UPON THE MOON DEUCEDAC
4153-61735-0012 IT IS TRUE HE HAD DESIGNS UPON THE HACIENDA BUT THESE DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EITHER ITS CASH PLATE OR JEWELLERY IF WE ACCEPT THAT MOST PRECIOUS JEWEL IT CONTAINED THE MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HERSELF
4323-13259-0000 THE CHURCH BELLS WERE RINGING AND PEOPLE ON THE AVENUE GOING BY TO SERVICE TURNED CURIOUS INQUIRING LOOKS OUT AT THE GREAT HOUSE AND THEN WENT ON TALKING OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD SO STRANGELY ENTERED INTO AND MADE HISTORY IN THE CITY
4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSIONED APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE BROTHERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMOND HAD VOTED TO PURSUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SALOON
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAYMOND SEEMED CONDEMNED BY THE RESULT
4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT IN RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULER
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT WITH HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM BRIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 WHAT IF I HAD BEGUN TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 WHEN HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEAR
4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDISTURBED BY ANY VIGOROUS EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WELLS OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKY POWER IN RAIMENT THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOR EVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SATURDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEETINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOONS AND ITS AWFUL CURSE
4323-13259-0013 GREY AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRERS WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO IN PAYING THEIR RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 GRAY HAD GONE UP TO JULIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER AND MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERALS SAID GREY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LOREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE A DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY MY JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PAGE THINK BEST SHALL BE RIGHT
4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DISPLAY AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS CERTAIN
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENT IN A NEIGHBOURING CITY
4323-13259-0020 HE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES OF THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES FOR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS OF THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTRE OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS TO THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALOONS
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUEER PART OF THEIR STRANGE SERVICE
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED
4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN BUT I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY
4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS PHRONSIE TURNED FEARFULLY AROUND
4323-18416-0001 I' WILL TRY AND SHE LAID A QUICK HAND ON THE KNOB
4323-18416-0002 TWO RED SPOTS BURNED ON HER CHEEKS AND HER PURE BLUE EYES SNAPPED
4323-18416-0003 I'M SURE I HEAR IT RAGING UP AND DOWN
4323-18416-0004 I DON'T WANT ANY DINNER SAID VIOLET DRAWING BACK
4323-18416-0005 YES INDEED SAID FANNY CHEERILY JUST AS FINE AS CAN BE
4323-18416-0006 ASSUREDLY SAID OLD MISTER KING WITH GREAT SATISFACTION IN POLLY'S PLEASURE AND AT HER SUCCESS IN DRAWING CHARLOTTE
4323-18416-0007 AND AFTER THIS THERE WERE NO MORE QUIET DAYS OF CHARLOTTE CHATTERTON
4323-18416-0008 OH BUS ME IT'S YOU PHRONSIE IN PLEASED SURPRISE
4323-18416-0009 YES GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE COMING ON AND SHUTTING THE DOOR CAREFULLY I CAME ON PURPOSE TO SEE YOU ALL ALONE
4323-18416-0010 SO YOU DID DEAR SAID MISTER KINGS HIGHLY GRATIFIED AND PUSHING AWAY HIS WRITING TABLE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
4323-18416-0011 OH NO GRANDPAPA CRIED PHRONSIE IN A RAPTURE I COULD NEVER BE TOO BIG FOR THAT SO SHE PERCHED UP AS OF OLD ON HIS KNEE THEN SHE FOLDED HER HANDS AND LOOKING GRAVELY IN HIS FACE
4323-18416-0012 OH MY DEAR WHAT IS IT
4323-18416-0013 EXCLAIMED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PRESENTLY YOU'VE COME TO TELL ME SOMETHING I SUPPOSE
4323-18416-0014 YES GRANDPAPA I HAVE SAID PHRONSIE DECIDEDLY AND IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TOO GRANDPAPA BUT OH I DO WISH IT SO MUCH AND SHE CLASPED HER HANDS TIGHTER AND SIGHED
4323-18416-0015 WELL THEN PHRONSIE IF YOU LIKE IT I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE SAID MISTER KING QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE

4323-18416-0019 GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE WEREN'T MISSUS CHATTERTON AUNT TO CHARLOTTE
4323-18416-0020 IF MISTER CHATTERTON WAS AUNT TO CHARLOTTE PERSISTED PHRONSIE SLOWLY IT SEEMS AS IF CHARLOTTE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF THE MONEY IT REALLY DOES GRANDPAPA
4323-18416-0021 MAYBE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A SHORT LAUGH AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF COUSIN EUNICE WAS SORRY ABOUT A FEW OTHER THINGS TOO PHRONSIE
4323-18416-0022 WOULDN'T IT MAKE HER VERY GLAD IF I GAVE CHARLOTTE SOME MONEY
4323-18416-0023 FOR ANSWER MISTER KING SET HER DOWN HASTILY ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK TWO OR THREE TURNS UP AND DOWN HER ROOM
4323-18416-0024 OH I DO SO WISH I MUST SHE SAID THERE'S SO MUCH FOR A LITTLE GIRL LIKE ME

4323-18416-0027 SURE AS I CAN BE PHRONSIE SAID OLD MISTER COOK SMILING GOOD BYE DEAR
4323-18416-0028 THAT THERE MY SISTER'S BOY SHALL NEVER SAY THAT BUT COME IN COME IN
4323-18416-0029 BUT TO BE UNGRACIOUS THE YOUNG MAN THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR
4323-18416-0030 OH HANG IT COLONEL WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME ALONE
4323-18416-0031 WHICH IS A WONDER INTERPOLATED PICKERSING
4323-18416-0032 I KNOW YOU DID UNCLE SAID PICKERING YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING IT'S GOOD
4323-18416-0033 FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE PICKERING CRIED HIS UNCLE DARTING IN FRONT OF HER CHAIR AND ITS RESTLESS OCCUPANT DON'T SAY THAT AGAIN
4323-18416-0034 I'VE BEEN A LAZY DOG ALL MY LIFE AN GOOD FOR NOUGHT BUT I HOPE I'VE NOT SUNK TO THAT
4323-55228-0000 THE NEXT MOMENT HE FELL BACK IN AMAZEMENT BEFORE THE IMPETUOUS RUSH OF A STARRY EYED FLUSH CHEEKED YOUNG WOMAN WHO DEMANDED A
4323-55228-0001 WHERE IS HE PETE MISS MAGGIE GASPED THE OLD MAN
4323-55228-0002 AUNT HANNAH'S CHEEKS TOO WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES STARRY BUT WITH DISMAY AND ANGER THE LAST BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PETE HAD SAID MISS LADY'S NAME
4323-55228-0003 IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO AND OF COURSE IT'S SHE
4323-55228-0004 RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE WAS HE
4323-55228-0005 INTERPOSED EMILY TELL MISTER BERTRAM I AM HERE OR WAIT I'LL GO RIGHT IN AND SURPRISE HIM
4323-55228-0006 PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE TOWARDS AUNT HANNAH'
4323-55228-0007 MISS BILLY MISTER BILLY YOU'RE AN ANGEL STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN YOU ARE YOU ARE OH I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME
4323-55228-0008 IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT IT'S IN THE DEN MISS BILLY
4323-55228-0009 BILLY TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE HE COULD TAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARD THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AUNT HANNAH'S INDIGNANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BILLY STOP
4323-55228-0010 PETE YOU GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHED
4323-55228-0011 BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN HE SPOKE IT
4323-55228-0012 A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES ON THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN
4323-55228-0013 DUNGLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY
4323-55228-0014 IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAMS'S GREY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE
4323-55228-0015 THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED FOR THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL
4323-55228-0016 AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE AT THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USABLE
4323-55228-0017 WHY OF COURSE STAMMERED WILLIAM I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU HAD FOUND OUT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
4323-55228-0018 HE DEMANDED BERTRAM ANGRY AND MYSTIFIED
4323-55228-0019 AS FOR MY NOT PAINTING AGAIN I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE DEARIE
4323-55228-0020 SHE PULLED HERSELF UP AWAY FROM BERTRAM'S ENCIRCLING ARM
4323-55228-0021 BILLY DREW A QUIVERED SIGH
4323-55228-0022 GOOD HEAVENS IS KATE ON THIS TOO BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS SAVAGE NOW
4323-55228-0023 OH SHE WROTE A LETTER
4323-55228-0024 BILLY LAUGHED GALY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES
4323-55228-0025 AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR THEM
4323-55228-0026 HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO WORK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS
4323-55228-0027 BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION UPON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHTS
4323-55228-0028 AFTER A MINUTE BILLY STARTED AND SIGHED HAPPILY
4323-55228-0029 OH YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARKWRIGHT
4323-55228-0030 AND AND YOU DIDN'T CARE SPECIALLY FOR OR MISS WINTHROP
4323-55228-0031 BILLY PUT A SOFT FINGER TO HIS LIPS
4323-55228-0032 BERTRAM KISSED THE FINGER AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMPLIMENTED
4323-55228-0033 WHY WHAT IS THAT IS THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY
4323-55228-0034 THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERRAM STIRRED
4323-55228-0035 BILLY I'M GOIN TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY
4323-55228-0036 I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL THEN YOU'D READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY
4323-55228-0037 I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW I'LL GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUND THAT LAW I GOT
4323-55228-0038 FOR FIVE DAYS INDEED SIR
4323-55228-0039 I WONDER IF YE THINK I CAN GET READY TO BE MARRIED IN FIVE DAYS
4323-55228-0040 DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY WHEN I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT
4323-55228-0041 IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS I'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE BUT
4323-55228-0042 BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME SHUT IN BERTRAM CRAFTILY
4323-55228-0043 THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY BUT BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT
4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS YOUNG LEFT ARM
4323-55228-0045 BILLY MY DEAR DEAR
4323-55228-0046 IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE
4323-55228-0047 WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE
4323-55228-0048 YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BACK BEFORE OCTOBER
4323-55228-0049 AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER SULLENLY
4323-55228-0050 YES NODDED DOROTHY DEMURELY
4323-55228-0051 YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE BERTRAM MERRILY
4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO MORNING BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW
4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORK WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH WE MUST NOW FULFIL
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DANGER WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SORROWED DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT
4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT HIS HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK
4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIANN WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT
4515-11057-0006 AND HE WROTE TO MARIAN
4515-11057-0007 WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR TO COME AND SEE ME
4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BUFFON AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THIS WAY OUT THERE
4515-11057-0010 I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEW
4515-11057-0011 AND POVERTY I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE
4515-11057-0012 BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS GIFFIN FOR A LONG TIME
4515-11057-0013 WAS HE STILL SO VERY POOR POOR
4515-11057-0014 ASKED AMINY COMPASSIONATELY
4515-11057-0015 AND I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY
4515-11057-0016 OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS CERTAINLY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HER DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE
4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THE
4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE ABOUT PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
4515-11057-0020 AMY HE MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN
4515-11057-0021 ESPECIALLY KNOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
4515-11057-0022 IS IT SO HIDEOUS
4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER DULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
4515-11057-0024 HER DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT
4515-11057-0025 HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDINGLY
4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY RECEIVE
4515-11057-0027 SO THERE WAS SILENCE
4515-11057-0028 THE LAST THREE YEARS I CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
4515-11057-0029 RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN SHE FIRST KNEW ME
4515-11057-0030 PERHAPS NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT
4515-11057-0031 YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFFS IN MY WORK RECENTLY
4515-11057-0032 DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CORN AND SO ON GENERALLY
4515-11057-0033 SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU THOUGH THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
4515-11057-0034 MY STORY IN THAT GIRL'S PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
4515-11057-0035 AND YOU COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
4515-11057-0036 I SURMISE THOUGH THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
4515-11057-0037 DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE TREATED
4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MIGHT BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT CAN I DO
4515-11057-0039 THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR YOUR ADVICE
4515-11057-0040 WELL I'LL DROP BACK TO MY SCRIBBLING
4515-11057-0041 AGAIN JASPER HELD THE BLACK SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT
4515-11057-0042 YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPORT MADE HIM ANGRY
4515-11057-0043 MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE UNDER HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ACTIVE BEATS OF HER HEART
4515-11057-0045 THAT HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY
4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEM ADDED
4515-11057-0047 WHERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE BATTLE
4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN WHICH
4515-11057-0049 YOU'VE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER
4515-11057-0050 MORE OF A BROOK YOU MEAN
4515-11057-0051 YOU KNOW VERY WELL DON'T
4515-11057-0052 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT ALL AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY
4515-11057-0053 NOW
4515-11057-0054 WILL YOU CARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE
4515-11057-0055 YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT
4515-11057-0056 I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JESPER
4515-11057-0057 SHE PAUSED AND THEN LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY
4515-11057-0058 SURE I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND
4515-11057-0059 HAS THAT ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU
4515-11057-0060 WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISTER MILVAIN
4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHERE THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM
4515-11057-0062 AND SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED
4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM ME WHEN YOU WERE MY WIFE
4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WELL AND THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
4515-11057-0065 EXCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER WAS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT
4515-11057-0066 DO YE THINK THEN INSURMOUNTABLE
4515-11057-0067 THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU CAN HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH
4515-11057-0068 I DON'T TRUST HIMSELF
4515-11057-0069 BUT SHALL SHE FACE THEM WILLINGLY
4515-11057-0070 PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MARIANA
4515-11057-0071 WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WITH ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD I SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME
4515-11057-0073 WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT AS THAT IS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0074 IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU PROTEST YOURSELF
4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN HARRY
4515-11057-0076 HOW AM I TO HAVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS
4515-11057-0077 I SO WISH IT
4515-11057-0078 A EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED
4515-11057-0079 IT IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR HER PARENTS
4515-11057-0080 YOU YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME
4515-11057-0081 IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY SISTER
4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIANA I CAN'T STAND IT
4515-11057-0083 I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO
4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BEHIND THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
4515-11057-0085 AND MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING
4515-11057-0086 IN WHAT SHOULD THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS
4515-11057-0087 BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT MIGHT SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
4515-11057-0088 YOU DON'T KNOW ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
4515-11057-0089 HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BUT FATE
4515-11057-0090 IS IT IN MY POWERS TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
4515-11057-0091 BUT IF I HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
4515-11057-0092 IF I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU
4515-11057-0093 WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN WE HAVE SAID NOW
4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THATS WHAT IT'S COME TO
4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD SAY IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT
4515-11057-0096 WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUE
4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOR DEMANDS IS A COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT YOUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME
4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO ME THE CHILDISH
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE ITS AUTUMNAL MIST
4515-11057-0101 JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY OH
4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM YOU
4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN TO THIS MORNING MARIAN YOU CAN'T WORK
4515-11057-0104 I WENT AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
4515-11057-0105 GOOD BYE SHE GAVE HIM HER HEAD
4515-11057-0106 THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN VIRGINIA LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER IT HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTERS SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TONES AND ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSE TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
4515-11057-0110 YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED YOUR FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THEN SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SELF AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 TWELVE DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THEIR TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MIGHTY AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN OR SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE BUT THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSEER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM PHYSICAL LIFE
4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTIONS
4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL IN HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTEE TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED HER GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOXHOUND ARE SO MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTY INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOUR IT IS AS MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 BUT PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE DRIVEN TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 IT IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HOUND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE'S FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS COVERED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTER HOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE SAME ORDER WERE BRED BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HARRIER AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBOROUGH HOUND SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
4570-14911-0008 THEN THEY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THEIR COUNTRY
4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHASTONS THE HOWSTEAD PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HOLTONS THE LEE PARKS THE STOKEPLACE THE S EDINBURGH THE SURBITON THE TRINITY FOOTE THE WOODDALE MISSUS G W HILLIARDS MISSUS PRICE'S AND MISSUS TURNER'S
4570-14911-0010 EYES BROW DARK HAZEL OR HAZEL NOT DEEP SET NOR BULGY AND WITH A MILD EXPRESSION
4570-14911-0011 EARS LONG SET ON LOW FINE IN TEXTURE AND HANGING IN A GRACEFUL FOLD CLOSE TO THE CHIN

4570-24733-0000 ALL THINGS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTRIBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BECOME INFINITE OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE ETERNAL AND INFINITE THROUGH THE SAID ATTRIBUTE
4570-24733-0001 PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT A SOMETHING IN SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD CAN FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THE SAID ATTRIBUTE AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE OR DURATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN THE ATTRIBUTE OF THOUGHT

4831-25894-0032 IN HER LONG STOCKING SHE FOUND ALL SORTS OF TREASURES FOR TOMPO HAD STUFFED IT FULL OF QUEER THINGS AND HIS MOTHER HAD MADE GINGERBREAD INTO EVERY IMAGINABLE SHAPE FROM FAT PIGS TO FULL OMNIBUSES
4831-25894-0033 LITTLE RONZO WAS ACCEPTED WITH DELIGHT BY THE KIND LADY AND HER CHILDREN AND TESSA LEARNED THE SONG QUITE EASY
4831-25894-0034 AROSE FROM THE CROWD OF CHILDREN GATHERED TO THE FESTIVALS
4831-25894-0035 BEFORE THEY WENT HOME THE KIND MAMMA TOLD TESSA SHE SHOULD BE HER FRIENDS AND GAVE HER A MOTHERLY KISS WHICH WARMED THE CHILD'S HEART AND SEEMED TO SET A SEAL UPON THAT PROMISE
4831-29134-0000 THE SENATOR TOOK HIS SEAT IN A PULPIT WITH THE MINISTER ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL ON THE OTHER
4831-29134-0001 SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE PRESENCE OF A LIVE UNITED STATES SENATOR THAT DURING THREE MINUTES NOT A SPIT BALL WAS THROWN
4831-29134-0002 AFTER THAT THEY BEGAN TO COME TO THEMSELVES BY DEGREES AND PRESENTLY THE SPECK WAS WHOLLY GONE AND THEY WERE RECITING VERSES AND PULLING HAIR
4831-29134-0003 THE USUAL SUNDAY SCHOOL EXERCISES WERE HURRIED THROUGH AND THEN THE MINISTER GOT UP AND BORED THE HOUSE WITH A SPEECH BUILT ON THE CUSTOMARY SUNDAY SCHOOL PLAN BUT THE SUPERINTENDENT PUT IN HIS OAR THEN THE TOWN DIGNITARIES HAD THEIR SAY
4831-29134-0004 AM I IN SOME POPULOUS CENTRE OF MY OWN COUNTRY WHERE THE CHOICEST CHILDREN OF THAT LAND HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND BROUGHT TOGETHER AS AT A FAIR FOR A PRIZE NO
4831-29134-0005 THEN WHERE AM I YES WHERE IS I
4831-29134-0006 MY SOUL IS LOST IN WONDER AT HER THOUGHT
4831-29134-0007 EARTH HAS NO HIGHER NO GRANDER POSITION FOR YOU
4831-29134-0008 THEN WHAT IS IT WHAT DID YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS REPLY
4831-29134-0009 WHY THINK OF THAT NOW I COULD HARDLY KEEP THE TEARS BACK I WAS SO GRATEFUL
4831-29134-0010 THEY COULD NOT GIVE HIM A COSTLY EDUCATION BUT THEY WERE GOOD AND WISE AND THEY SENT HIM TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL HE LIVED THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
4831-29134-0011 I HOPE YOU LOVE YOUR SUNDAY SCHOOL AY SEE BY YOUR FACES THAT YOU DO THAT'S RIGHT
4831-29134-0012 ALWAYS LOVE YOUR TEACHERS YOUR CHILDREN FOR THEY LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN KNOW NOW
4831-29134-0013 AND BY AND BY THE PEOPLE MADE HIM GOVERNOR AND HE SAID IT WAS ALL OWING TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS
4831-29134-0014 WHY THE PEOPLE GAVE HER A TOWERING ILLUSTRIOUS POSITION A GRAND IMPOSING POSITION
4831-29134-0015 IT WAS SENATOR HUNTER OF THE UNITED STATES
4831-29134-0016 THAT POOR LITTLE BOY WHO LOVED HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL BECAME THAT MAN THAT MAN STANDS BEFORE YOU
4831-29134-0017 ABOVE ALL THINGS MY WOMEN BE HONEST
4831-29134-0018 WHEN SENATOR DILWORTHY DEPARTED FROM CADILLVILLE HE LEFT THREE DOZEN BOYS BEHIND HIM ARRANGING A CAMPAIGN OF LIFE WHOSE OBJECTIVE POINT WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATE
5543-27761-0000 LULEDCHKA WAS A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
5543-27761-0001 THERE WAS NO OTHER SUCH CHILD THERE NEVER HAD BEEN AND IT NEVER WOULD BE
5543-27761-0002 LUETZKA'S MOTHER SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA WAS SURE OF THAT
5543-27761-0003 LULLITKA'S EYES WERE DARK AND LARGE HER CHEEKS WERE ROSY HER LIPS WERE MADE FOR KISSES AND FOR LAUGHTER
5543-27761-0004 BUT IT WAS NOT THESE CHARMS IN LAOTCHKA THAT GAVE HER MOTHER THE KEENEST JOY
5543-27761-0005 SHE FELT COOL WITH HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0006 HE WAS ALWAYS FRESH AND COOL WITH A FRIGID SMILE AND WHEREVER HE PASSED COLD CURRENTS SEEMED TO MEET IN THE AIR
5543-27761-0007 IT EVEN SEEMED TO SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER FUTURE HUSBAND AND THUS MADE HER HAPPY
5543-27761-0008 THE BRIDE WAS ALSO A GOOD LOOKING SHE WAS A TALL DARK EYED DARK HAIRED GIRL SOMEWHAT TIMID BUT VERY TACTFUL
5543-27761-0009 AND HE HAD CONNECTIONS AND HIS WIFE CAME OF GOOD INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE
5543-27761-0010 THIS MIGHT AT THE PROPER OPPORTUNITY BE USEFUL
5543-27761-0011 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MANNER OF SERGEY MOROTOVITCH TO SUGGEST ANYTHING WRONG TO HIS WIFE
5543-27761-0012 LATER HOWEVER WHEN HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD SERGEY MODOSTOVITCH ESTABLISHED CONNECTIONS ELSEWHERE OF A LIGHT AND TEMPORARY NATURE
5543-27761-0013 SARAFID ALEXANDROVNA FOUND THIS OUT AND TO HER OWN ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY HURT SHE AWAITED HER INFANT WITH A RESTLESS ANTICIPATION THAT SWALLOWED EVERY OTHER FEELING
5543-27761-0014 SARIFIMA ALEXANDROVNA DRIFTED FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM HIM
5543-27761-0015 LUTCHKA THEN RAN AWAY STAMPING WITH HER PLUMP LITTLE LEGS OVER THE CARPETS AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR HER BEDROOM
5543-27761-0016 WHERE IS MY BABY GIRL THE MOTHER ASKED AS SHE LOOKED FOR LOLLACHKA AND MADE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID NOT SEE HER
5543-27761-0017 THEN SHE CAME OUT A LITTLE FARTHER AND HER MOTHER AS THOUGH SHE HAD ONLY JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SEIZED HER BY HER LITTLE SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED JOYOUSLY HERE SHE IS MY LALECHKA
5543-27761-0018 HER MOTHER'S EYES GLOWED WITH EMOTION
5543-27761-0019 AND HER MOTHER WENT TO HIDE
5543-27761-0020 LULECHKA TURNED AWAY AS THOUGH NOT TO SEE BUT WATCHED HER MAMUCHKA STEALTHILY ALL THE TIME
5543-27761-0021 WHERE IS MYMA MOTCHKA ASKED LULETSHKA
5543-27761-0022 A SMILE OF ABSOLUTE BLISS PLAYED OF HER RED LIPS
5543-27761-0023 THE LESCHKA WAS GETTING NEAR HER MOTHER'S CORNER
5543-27761-0024 HER MOTHER WAS GROWING MORE ABSORBED EVERY MOMENT BY HER INTEREST IN THE GAME HER HEART BEAT WITH SHORT QUICK STRUGGLES AND SHE PRESSED EVEN CLOSER TO THE WALL DISARRANGING HER HAIR STILL MORE
5543-27761-0025 VALLECHKA SUDDENLY GLANCED TOWARD HER MOTHER'S CORNER AND SCREAMED WITH JOY
5543-27761-0026 THROUGH THE HALF CLOSED DOORS I HEARD THE LAUGHTER THE JOYOUS OUTCRIES THE SOUND OF ROMPING
5543-27761-0027 EVEN PHODOLIA FELT ABASHED NOW FOR HER MISTRESS NOW FOR HERSELF
5543-27761-0028 HE LIKED COMING HERE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED THIS WAS DONE BY SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA WHO WISHED TO SURROUND HER LITTLE GIRL FROM HER VERY INFANCY WITH THE LOVELIEST THINGS
5543-27761-0029 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA DRESSED HERSELF TASTEFULLY THIS TOO SHE DID FOR LUETCHKA WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW
5543-27761-0030 ONE THING SERGEY MONOSTOVITCH HAD NOT BECOME RECONCILED TO AND THAT WAS HIS WIFE'S ALMOST CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN THE NURSERY
5543-27761-0031 IT'S JUST AS I THOUGHT I KNEW THAT I'D FIND YOU HERE HE SAYS WITH A DERISIVE AND CONDESCENDING SMILE
5543-27761-0032 MERELY YOU SAY THAT THE CHILD SHOULD FEEL ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY HE EXPLAINED IN ANSWER TO SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA'S PUZZLED GLANCE
5543-27761-0033 SHE'S STILL TOO LITTLE SAID SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0034 I DON'T INSIST IT'S YOUR KINGDOM SIR
5543-27761-0035 I'LL THINK IT OVER HIS WIFE ANSWERED SMILING AS HE DID NOT COLDLY BUT GENIALLY
5543-27761-0036 THEN THEY WENT TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0037 THAT THE MISTRESS DOES IT ALL THAT'S ONE THING BUT THAT THE YOUNG LADY DOES IT THAT'S BAD
5543-27761-0038 WHY ASKED FIDO SO WITH CURIOSITY
5543-27761-0039 THIS EXPRESSION OF CURIOSITY GAVE HER FACE THE LOOK OF A WILD ROUGHLY PAINTED DOLL
5543-27761-0040 YES IT'S BAD REPEATED AGATHYO WITH CONVICTION TERRIBLY BAD WELL
5543-27761-0041 IT'S THE TRUTH I'M SAYING REMEMBER MY WORDS AGATHEA WENT ON WITH THE SAME ASSURANCES AND SECRECY
5543-27761-0042 IT'S THE SUREEST SIGN
5543-27761-0043 THE OLD WOMAN HAD INVENTED THIS SAYING QUITE SUDDENLY HERSELF AND SHE WAS EVIDENTLY VERY PROUD OF IT
5543-27761-0044 MADAME MADAME SHE SAID QUICKLY IN A TREMBLING VOICE
5543-27761-0045 SARABIMA ALEXANDROVNA GAVE A START
5543-27761-0046 FEDOSAN'S FACE MADE HER ANXIOUS
5543-27761-0047 WHAT IS IT FEDOSYA SHE ASKED WITH GREAT CONCERN IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH LULLETKA
5543-27761-0048 NO MADAME SAID FIDO AS SHE GESTICULATED WITH HER HAND TO REASSURE HER MISTRESS AND TO MAKE HER SIT DOWN
5543-27761-0049 LATCHKA IS ASLEEP MAY GOD BE WITH HER
5543-27761-0050 ONLY I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING YOU SEE LULETSHKA IS ALWAYS HIDING HERSELF THAT IS NO GOOD
5543-27761-0051 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BAD IT IS SAID FEDOSIA AND HER FACE EXPRESSED THAT MOST DECIDED CONFIDENCE
5543-27761-0052 I UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF WHAT YOU AM SAYING
5543-27761-0053 YOU SEE MADAM IT'S A KIND OF OMEN EXPLAINS FEDOSEY ABRUPTLY IN A SHAMEFACED WAY
5543-27761-0054 NONSENSE SAID SARAFIMY ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0055 WHO TOLD YOU ALL THAT ASKED SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA IN AN AUSTERE LOW VOICE
5543-27761-0056 THOSE EXCLAIMED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA IN IRRITATION AS THOUGH SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HERSELF SOMEHOW FROM THIS SUDDEN ANXIETY
5543-27761-0057 WHAT NONSENSE AS THOUGH LILLETCHKA COULD DIE
5543-27761-0058 SHE SAW CLEARLY THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN A CHILD'S QUITE ORDINARY DIVERSION AND THAT CONTINUATION OF THE CHILD'S LIFE
5543-27761-0059 SHE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT THAT EVENING TO OCCUPY HER MIND WITH OTHER MATTERS BUT HER THOUGHTS TURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO THE FACT THAT LULLETSHKA LOVED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0060 WHEN LUDSHKA WAS STILL QUITE SMALL AND HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HER NURSE SHE SOMETIMES SITTING IN HER NURSE'S ARMS MADE A SUDDEN ROGUISH GRIMACE AND HID HER LAUGHING FACE ON THE NURSE'S SHOULDER
5543-27761-0061 BUT THEN SHE WOULD LOOK OUT WITH A SLY GLANCE
5543-27761-0062 THOUGH SHE REPROACHED HERSELF AT ONCE FOR THIS UNFOUNDED SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD NOT ENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF LAETCHKA'S FAVOURITE GAME AND SHE TRIED TO DIVERT LUETCHKA'S ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0063 SHE EAGERLY COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S NEW FEELINGS
5543-27761-0064 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA TRIED DESPERATELY TO AMUSE ELETCHKA
5543-27761-0065 PERHAPS THOUGHT SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA SHE IS NOT AS STRONGLY DRAWN TO THE WORLD AS THE OTHER CHILDREN WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY MANY THINGS
5543-27761-0066 IF THIS IS SO IS IT NOT A SIGN OF ORGANIC GENIUS
5543-27761-0067 ZRAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA HERSELF BEGAN THE GAME ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH SHE PLAYED IT WITH A HEAVY HEART
5543-27761-0068 SHE ANSWERED AS THOUGH COMMITTING AN EVIL DEED WITH FULL CONSCIOUSNESS
5543-27761-0069 IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR SARAFIMO ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0070 HER MOTHER FOLLOWED HER WITH A BLUE BLANKET
5543-27761-0071 LULLUTSKA DREW HER SWEET LITTLE HANDS FROM UNDER THE BLANKET AND STRETCHED THEM OUT TO EMBRACE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER BENT DOWN
5543-27761-0072 SHE SEEMED SO SMALL AND SO FRAIL UNDER THE BLANKET AND COVERED HER
5543-27761-0073 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA REMAINED STANDING OVER LUETCHKA'S BED A LONG WHILE SHE KEPT LOOKING AT LUETCHKA WITH TENDERNESS AND FEAR
5543-27761-0074 I'M A MOTHER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT HER SHE THOUGHT AS SHE IMAGINED THE VARIOUS ILLS THAT MIGHT BEFALL ALLATSHKA
5543-27761-0075 SHE PRAYED LONG THAT NIGHT AND THE PRAYER DID NOT RELIEVE HER SADNESS
5543-27761-0076 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED LUTETCHKA CAUGHT COLD
5543-27761-0077 THE FEVER COMES UPON HER AT NIGHT
5543-27761-0078 WHEN SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA AWAKENED BY FEDOSYA CAME TO LAELETCHKA AND SAW HER LOOKING SO HOT SO RESTLESS AND SO TORMENTED SHE INSTANTLY RECALLED THE EVIL OMEN AND A HOPELESS DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS
5543-27761-0079 A DOCTOR WAS CALLED AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS BUT THAT INEVITABLE HAPPENED
5543-27761-0080 AND LUTHERCHKA GREW FEEBLER FROM HOUR TO HOUR
5543-27761-0081 NOTHING MADE HER SO UNHAPPY AS THE REITERATIONS OF FEDOSYA UTTERED BETWEEN SOBS SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF AROIECHKA
5543-27761-0082 FEVER WAS CONSUMING LULESCHKA AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND SPOKE IN DELIRIUM
5543-27761-0083 THREE DAYS FOLLOWED TORTURING LIKE A NIGHTMARE
5543-27761-0084 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA HID HER FACE BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR LUETKA'S BED HOW TRAGIC
5543-27761-0085 WAIT MAMOTCHKA WHISPERED LULUTSHKA
5543-27761-0086 MMOTCHKA'S WHITE FACE BECAME BLURRED AND EVERYTHING GREW DARK BEFORE LULLETSHKA
5543-27761-0087 SHE HEARD HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0088 SARIFIMA ALEXANDROVNA WAS STANDING BY THE COFFIN AND LOOKING DULLY AT HER DEAD CHILD
5543-27761-0089 SIMA MY DEAR DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF SAID SERGEY MOLOSTOVITCH IN A WHISPER
5543-27761-0090 YOU MUST RESIGN YOURSELF TO THE FATE
5543-27761-0091 SHE'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE PERSISTED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA HER EYES FIXED ON THAT DEAD LITTLE GIRL
5543-27761-0092 SERGEY MOROSTOVITCH LOOKED ROUND HIM CAUTIOUSLY HE WAS AFRAID OF THE UNSEEMLY AND OF THE RIDICULOUS
5543-27761-0093 SOMA DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF HE REPEATED
5543-27761-0094 HE WAS CONFUSED AND ANNOYED AND
5543-27761-0095 HER FACE SEEMED TRANQUIL AND HER EYES WERE GREY
5543-27761-0096 SHE WENT INTO THE NURSERY AND BEGAN TO WALK ROUND THE ROOM LOOKING INTO THOSE PLACES WHERE LILLETCHKA USED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0097 SHE WALKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND BENT NOW AND THEN TO LOOK UNDER THE TABLE OR UNDER THE BED AND KEPT ON REPEATING CHEERFULLY WHERE'S MY LITTLE ONE WHERE IS MY LULETZKA
5543-27761-0098 AFTER SHE HAD WALKED ROUND HER ROOM ONCE SHE BEGAN TO MAKE HER QUEST ANEW
5543-27761-0099 FEDOSYA MOTIONLESS WITH DEJECTED FACE STOOD IN A CORNER AND LOOKED FRIGHTENED AT HER MISTRESS THEN SHE SUDDENLY BURST OUT SOBBING AND SHE WAILED LOUDLY
5543-27761-0100 SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LUOLATCHKA OUR ANGELIC LITTLE SOUL
5543-27761-0101 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOR THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE BETWEEN HER AND LATSHKA
5543-27761-0102 THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF HEAVINESS IN SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA'S HEAD AS SHE APPROACHED LULLETTESHKA
5543-27761-0103 LUDUTKA LAY THERE STILL AND PALE AND SMILED PATHETICALLY
5543-27761-0104 THE OTHER ONE DID NOT REPLY
5543-27761-0105 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA STOOD UP ERECT SIGHED IN A LOST WAY SMILED AND CALLED LOUDLY LULETSHKA
5543-27761-0106 LAETCHKA IS BEING CARRIED OUT
5849-50873-0000 CAP'N PAUL THE COMMANDER OF A SMALL GARRISON AT SEBROOK PERMITTED HIM TO LAND BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO READ HIS COMMISSION BILL ORDERED HIM TO BE SILENT
5849-50873-0001 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MISTER PRINCE WADSWORTH ASKED FOR HE COULD SEE THAT THE MAN WAS GREATLY EXCITED GOVERNOR ANDROSE HAS COME AGAIN GASPED MISTER PRINCE WHY SHOULD THAT ALARM US THE FELLOW THOUGH GIVEN TO BOASTING IS NOT DANGEROUS OR LIABLE TO PUT HIS THREATS INTO EXECUTION BUT HE HAS GROWN DANGEROUS DECLARED MISSUS PRINCE THE LIBERTIES OF THE COLONY ARE INVOLVED
5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY THOUGH HE WERE STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THE MATTER LIGHTLY
5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR MEDICAL RIGHTS
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VISCAROY HAS COME TO HARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD DECLARED YE SHALL NOT HAVE IT
5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN THE HEATED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO WAITING THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND LOOKED
5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE ANIMAL DOING ENGAGED IN A DEBATE
5849-50873-0010 AND WILL SHE WAIT UNTIL IT IS ENDED HE HAS PROMISED TO DO SO
5849-50873-0011 MISTER PRINCE FIXED HIS AMAZED EYES ON THE CAPTAIN'S FACE AND READ THERE WITH DESPERATE DETERMINATION CAPTAIN HE BEGAN
5849-50873-0012 MISTER P PRINCE BOWED AND HASTILY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE THE ASSEMBLY WAS IN SESSION
5849-50873-0013 SO SOON AS HE WAS GONE CHARLES STEVENS SAID
5849-50873-0014 YES CHILD YOU WILL ANSWER WHAT DO YOU MEAN UNCLE
5849-50873-0015 NEVER DID DEBATERS TAKE PROPER INTEREST IN A MINOR SUBJECT
5849-50873-0016 WHAT DO YOU INTEND DOING UNCLE WILL YOU FIGHT THEM THEN
5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT AT THAT TIME NOT TOO SOON OR TOO LATE
5849-50873-0018 THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE DOCTOR SAID
5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO THE ASSAULT
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE MISSION
5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PLACE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN BLOODSWORTH
5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT AS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING ESPECIALLY ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE AND TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALLS
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE FLOOR WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATIONED NEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOWS A FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOWED HIM AS HAPPILY AS HE COULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED HIS HAND
5849-50873-0028 BOYD HAVE A CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WADSWORTH THE TRAIN VANE CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 AND WHERE IS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HAVE THE TRAINBANDS AT CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
5849-50873-0032 WHO OF YOU HATH THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY CRIED THE ENRAGED COLONEL
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY SHOWED THEIR HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE DO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVE IN CONNECTICUT WHAT DOES HE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL ASSISTANT DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE LITTLE TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARDS KNOWN AS THE CHARTING OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER OF THIS SEIZURE OF THE CHARTERS WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN THE ASSEMBLY OF RHODE ISLAND SENT A MOST LOYAL ADDRESS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMALLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS TO ITS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE FORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENSE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG UPON THEIR FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTERWARD TO THE EXPULSION OF ANDROSE
5849-50962-0000 CALLED BERT WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO COME DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE
5849-50962-0001 IT'S A SCHOONER SAID MISTER BINGHAM TO MISTER MINTURN AND SHE HAS A VERY PRETTY CARGO
5849-50962-0002 TO THIS CORD WAS FASTENED A HEAVILY ROPE OR CABLE

5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BERT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AN THE BREECHES BUOY WILL GO OUT IN A PULLEY
5849-50962-0007 IT IS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MUCH OF THE WICKED STORM HAD PASSED
5849-50962-0008 IN THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS AND WOMEN TO THE BEACH
5849-50962-0009 MISSUS BOBBSEY MISSUS MINTURN NELLIE AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND NAN WERE ALL THERE FLOSSIE AND FREDDIE BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINAH AND SUSANS
5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND BERT AND HAL PREPARED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE SOME MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BUOY WAS RETURNING
5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER IT CAME UNTIL NOW A WOMAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THE GIRL AND WOMEN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK WITH THE LIFEGUARDS AND A MAN IN THE CORK BELT BANDED UPON SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERYONE GATHERED ROUND AND NELLIE WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FLYING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DROWNED MAN RUBBED HIS HANDS AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
5849-50962-0018 AND THIS GEORGE BINGHAM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE BROTHER
5849-50962-0019 SAFE AND WELL WERE THE WELCOME ANSWER
5849-50962-0020 I HOPE OUR PRAYERS WERE HEARD LAST NIGHT
5849-50962-0021 HERE COMES ANOTHER MAN EXCLAIMED THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A BIG MAN DASHED UP THE SANDS
5849-50962-0022 WALL I'D DECLARE WE DID LAND ON A FRIENDLY SHORE
5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BINGHAM SAID THE LIFE SAVING WORK TURNED OUT TO BE A SOCIAL AFFAIR FOR THERE WAS THE GREAT TIME GREETING NELLIE'S FATHER AND HAL'S UNCLE
5849-50962-0024 THAT HAL AND HIS FATHER TOO PUT IN NAN
5849-50962-0025 WHAT A MORNING THAT WAS AT SUN SET BEACH
5849-50962-0026 I' AM SO GLAD WE PRAYED SAID LITTLE FLOSSIE TO FREDDIE WHEN SHE HEARD THE GOOD NEWS
5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THEIR DREADFUL STORM
5849-50963-0001 AND SOMEBODY WAS SO HAPPY
5849-50963-0002 THE NEPTUNE THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SAND BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROWBOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISH
5849-50963-0003 NOW WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A FEVER
5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHY DELAYED US SO
5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EVERY THING LOADED ON THE SCHOONER AND WE STARTED OFF
5849-50963-0006 WE COUNTED ON GETTING ONE LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUES ASKED MISTER BOBBSEY WHO WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 THE VOICE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 WELL I'M A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE MC GLAUGHLAN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST CHINA FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US A LIFETIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN A YEAR
5849-50963-0011 MAYBE AUNT EMILY WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE CITY ON HER SHOPPING TOUR SUGGESTED NAN
5849-50963-0012 THEY MADE THE CLERKS REMOVE ALL THE TRUCKS FROM THE AISLES AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN
5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THOSE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FACED AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BYE TO YOU NELLIE TOLD DOROTHY AND NAN NEXT MORNING
5849-50964-0001 NOW THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NAN
5849-50964-0002 YOU IS QUITE RICH NOW AREN'T YOU REMARKED DOROTHY
5849-50964-0003 AND DOROTHY WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THAT PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S PROUD SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE CHOKING DOROTHY
5849-50964-0005 COME NELLIE CALLED MISSUS MC GLAUGHTON I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAT
5849-50964-0006 WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NELLIE TOLD HIM
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE WAS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE US THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MOST OF EM I GUESS ANSWERED BERK
5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A LONG VACATION AND I AM WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
5849-50964-0010 SO AM I RETURNED NAN VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THAT FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FREDDY AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCKS AND SNOOP THE CAT
5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR TWO FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION
6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR LAUGH IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISIBLE VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF FORCE
6123-59150-0003 SUDDENLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A FOOL AUTHOR
6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY WERE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LIGHT IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 DOSTOEVSKI COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE OF NEKHLUDOFF IN RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE IDIERS
6123-59150-0009 ONE RESULT OF THIS HAS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
6123-59150-0010 EVEN THE TALK IS OF ACCIDENTS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 WE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SUCK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN IN HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD GONE AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OR DOSTOEVSKY
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ENNA KRENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 I SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS OF GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST FOR AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC AND GROTESQUES
6123-59150-0020 I WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BEARING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BITTER MANIACS
6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT SUGGESTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'D COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHORITIES
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH AN HORN OF PLENTY
6123-59150-0026 DOSTEEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFFIEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEWKONSKI AGLEA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VARYA FERUSHENKO NASTASYA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL YVOLGAN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INSTRUMENTS AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISS MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THE DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK WAS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN HE DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE WE ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS IT IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRIT OR CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORKS THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CERAVOS
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THY MINE UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 THEN BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MOISHKIN IN THE IDIOT
6123-59150-0040 HIS HAIR LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
6123-59150-0041 THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT ENGLISH OF THE MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUGUET DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SITTING ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SCLAVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BETWEEN DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS
6123-59150-0046 THIS IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS
6123-59186-0000 HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT AN SINGER
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORE
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDSY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS MYSELF EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THUS SHE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THAT COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 AND PROSE INTRUDERS IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE ON THE SAME POEM ABOUT
6123-59186-0008 AND WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 CATERING IT IS AN APPALLING PHRASE
6123-59186-0010 IS A TIME OF GOOD POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND SEARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUOLE MAKE AND AS THE WHOLE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 SHE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 I CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THAT IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES
6123-59186-0016 HIS WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE AND OF POVERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOST EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDEN'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD LONELY AWAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY
6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THE THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDEN'S POEMS THE OXEN
6123-59186-0022 WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STORYEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN
6123-59186-0023 THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDET'S PREVAILING MOOD
6123-59186-0024 WE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY
6123-59186-0025 HOW LITTLE HE CRIES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO
6123-59186-0026 WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORNED TO STAND BOND SLAVES TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS
6123-59186-0027 BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION A SENIOR SOUL'S FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE
6123-59186-0028 AND GENERAL HELL HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AND DOVES
6123-59186-0029 SOME FICKLE AND FAINT HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM NEW LOVES
6123-59186-0030 AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY ROLL THEY ON OUR DEEDS
6123-59186-0031 MISTER HARDY HAS TOO GREAT A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR
6123-59186-0032 THE REAL WORLD FOR MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE
6123-59186-0033 IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDSEY'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE
6123-59186-0034 FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES AT BOTH
6123-59186-0035 HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS WROUGHT IN THE GRAVE DEFEAT OF THEIR GLORY
6123-59186-0036 THE LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH
6123-59186-0037 IN BEYOND THE LAST MOUTH WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE
6123-59186-0038 NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON THE YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES
6123-59186-0039 THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWNS
6123-59186-0040 NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSELIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DUMB HUED DAYS
6267-53049-0000 IT'S A MAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T IT
6267-53049-0001 PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE SAID THE AULDER SISTER WISTFULLY
6267-53049-0002 DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT HER ALL THE NEXT DAY
6267-53049-0003 SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMIRED IT FROM THE WORLD
6267-53049-0004 HE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO SAY A NEW DRESS
6267-53049-0005 DORIS HUNTER I BELIEVE IT'S AN OLD QUILL
6267-53049-0006 MISSUS PENELOPE MY DEAR DORIS
6267-53049-0007 LOVE TO PENNELOP AND YOURSELF
6267-53049-0008 YOUR AFFECTIONATE AUNT ADELA MONTE
6267-53049-0009 I DON'T SEE YOUR BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A GREAT
6267-53049-0010 IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT THAT IS ALL FADED NOW
6267-53049-0011 TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN
6267-53049-0012 IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELA TO SEND IT SAID DIDRIS DUTIFULLY
6267-53049-0013 WHY THE WRONG HEAD IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PENELOPE
6267-53049-0014 WHAT LOVELY OLD THINY STUFF AND NOT A BIT FADED
6267-53049-0015 I DECLARE IT IS AS GOOD AS YOU
6267-53049-0016 WELL LET US GO AND HAVE CHIAT SAID PENELOPE I'M DECIDEDLY HUNGRY
6267-53049-0017 BESIDE I SEE THE POVERTY BOCKER COMING
6267-53049-0018 IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSES IN HEIR LOOM AFTER ALL
6267-53049-0019 PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEARD COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY IN THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS THE POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET
6267-53049-0020 SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND THEIR DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE
6267-53049-0021 PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER TRYING
6267-53049-0022 SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT FROM THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
6267-53049-0023 MY AUNT ADELA GAVE ME TO GIVE US THE MATERIAL SHE STAMMERED
6267-53049-0024 I'M NAMED AFTER HER MISSUS FAIRWATER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ROUND PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVELY OLD FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND TENDERNESS
6267-53049-0025 THEN YOU ARE MY GRAND NIECE I SAID
6267-53049-0026 WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT ROSE BUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN TIIBET
6267-53049-0027 PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE DELIGHTED TO EACH OTHER
6267-53049-0028 SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSE HOLD WAS BROKE UP
6267-53049-0029 MY DEAR AND I AM A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME
6267-53049-0030 NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRFIELDER'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY
6267-53049-0031 DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS CHANGED IN THE TWINED CLING OF AN HOUR
6267-53049-0032 WHEN MISSUS FAIRLOTHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
6267-65525-0000 AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINTY AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW
6267-65525-0001 AUNT JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BABY CLANGING FROM THE OTHER
6267-65525-0002 SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND LOVELY AS A SUNFLOWER WAS AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS
6267-65525-0003 I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BIGGSBY IS THIS EVENING SIDDY AND YOU WILL TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK
6267-65525-0004 SYDNEY SIGHED AND WENT DOWN STAIRS WITH THE BABY
6267-65525-0005 ALL HER DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERILY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
6267-65525-0006 BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY THEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER
6267-65525-0007 THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX BELOW THE KITCHEN WHICH SYDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS
6267-65525-0008 HER BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL OF THE AVAILABLE SPACE
6267-65525-0009 JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A PIECE AND THE MOUTH ZIG ZAGGED FROM EAR TO EAR
6267-65525-0010 SYDNEY HATED THAT MIRROR AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD HATE
6267-65525-0011 HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SYDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH SOME BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THE DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID
6267-65525-0012 PRESENTLY HE BEGAN TO WRITE WITH A FLUSH OF REAL EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE
6267-65525-0013 ONLY ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO ELLEN DOUGLAS AND THAT WAS FORWARDED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFFERING EDITOR OF THE MAPLE LEAF
6267-65525-0014 HE WROTE THAT ALTHOUGH HIS AGE DEPRIVED HIM FROM MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB HE WAS TWENTY AND THE LIMIT WAS EIGHTEEN HE READ THE LETTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH MUCH INTEREST AND OFTEN HAD THOUGHT OF ANSWERING SOME OF THE REQUESTS FOR CORRESPONDENCE
6267-65525-0015 HE NEVER HAD DONE SO BUT ELLEN DOUGLAS'S LETTER WAS SO INTERESTING THAT HE WAS DECIDED TO WRITE TO HER
6267-65525-0016 WOULD I BE KING ENOUGH TO CORRESPOND WITH HIM
6267-65525-0017 HE WAS TWO YEARS OFF FROM THE EAST AND HAD NOT YET FORGOTTEN TO BE HOMESICK AT TIMES
6267-65525-0018 SYDNEY LIKED HER LETTER AND ANSWERED IT
6267-65525-0019 SHE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET JOHN LINCOLN NOR COULD SHE WISH TO DO SO
6267-65525-0020 IN THE CORRESPONDENCE ITSELF SHE FOUND HER PLACE
6267-65525-0021 JOHN LINCOLN WROTE BREEZY ACCOUNTS OF RANGE LIFE AND ADVENTURES ON THE FAR WESTERN PLAINS SO ALIEN AND REMOTE FROM SNUG HUMDRUM PLANEFIELD LIFE THAT SIDNEY ALWAYS HAD THE SENSATION OF CROSSING A GULF WHEN SHE OPENED A LETTER FROM THE BAR AND AS FOR SYDNEY'S OWN LETTER THIS IS THE WAY IT READ AS SHE WROTE IT
6267-65525-0022 THE EVERGREENS PLAINFOOT DEAR MISTER LINCOLN
6267-65525-0023 I LOVE A LIFE AND ITS BLOOM AND BRILLIANCY I LOVE MEETING NEW PEOPLE I LOVE THE RIPPLE OF MUSIC THE HUM OF LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION
6267-65525-0024 THE MAN I HAD BEEN TALKING WITH WAS PAUL MOORE THE REAL NOVELIST
6267-65525-0025 AS IT WAS I HAD CONTRADICTED HIM TWICE AND HE HAD LAUGHED AND LIKED IT BUT HIS BOOKS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A NEW MEANING TO ME HENCEFORTH THROUGH THE INSIGHT HE HIMSELF HATH GIVEN ME
6267-65525-0026 IT IS SUCH MEETINGS AS THESE THAT GIVE LIFE HIS SPARKLE FOR ME
6267-65525-0027 YOU MAY BE WEARY OF MY RHAPSODIES OVER HER
6267-65525-0028 SHE HAS SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR MY EVERY ONE
6267-65525-0029 YOURS SINCERELY S SYDNEY RICHMOND
6267-65525-0030 OLD JANE CAME HOME PRESENTLY AND CARRIED AWAY HER SLEEPING BABY SYDNEY SAID HER PRAYERS WENT TO BED AND SLEPT SOUNDLY AND SERENNIALLY SHE MAILED HER LETTERS THE NEXT DAY AND A MONTH LATER AN ANSWER CAME
6267-65525-0031 SYDNEY DID NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT AND DOZED RESTLESSLY ABOUT OR CRIED IN HER PILLOW
6267-65525-0032 THE POOR WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD
6267-65525-0033 SYDNEY TROD THE WAY OF THE TRANSGRESSOR AND FOUND THAT ITS THORNS BURND TO BONE AND MARROW
6267-65525-0034 YOU CAN SEE THAT ROAD OUT DARK
6267-65525-0035 AND THERE WAS NO HARBOUR NOR GLIMPSE OF DISTANT SEA VISIBLE

6467-97061-0001 THEY RUSHED INTO THE ROOM ADDED THEIR CRIES TO HERS AND FORGETTING ALL THE FORMER PRECAUTIONS LEFT THE DOORS OPEN SO THAT THE GUARDS OUTSIDE HEARING THE CLAMOR ENTERED AND SAW THE PRINCE
6467-97061-0002 SHE IS A DISGRACE TO HER FAMILY AND SHALL NEVER SEE HER HUSBAND IMPALED ON A STAKE
6467-97061-0003 THEN WITH HIS FOREHEAD DISFIGURED BY A FEARFUL FROWN HE CONTINUED TO ABUSE A PRINCE AND HAVING TIED HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM DRAGGED HIM FROM THE ROOM
6467-97061-0004 TREATED THUS LIKE SOME WILD BEAST ROUGHLY SHAKEN AND NEGLECTED RAJAVAHANNA WOULD HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY HAD HE NOT BEEN PROTECTED BY THE MAGIC DUEL GIVEN TO HIM IN PATHHALLA AND WHICH HE HAD CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IN HIS HAIR
6467-97061-0005 ADVANCING THEREFORE WITH A LARGE ARMY HE PREPARED TO BESIEGE CHOMPA THE CAPITAL CITY
6467-97061-0006 A HORRIBLE BATTLE ENSUED IN WHICH BOTH KINGS WERE FORMED PRODIGIES OF VALOUR
6467-97061-0007 SHOULD THERE BE NO PITY FOR THE VIOLATOR OF THE HAREM

6467-97061-0018 THE SLAYER OF GENDRAVA MARMA HEARING THIS CAME OUT OF THE PALACE AND QUICKLY MOUNTING THE ELEPHANT WHO HELD DOWN HIS TRUNK TO RECEIVE HIM PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE PRINCE
6467-97061-0019 GREAT WAS THEIR MUTE ASTONISHMENT AND JOY WHEN THEY RECOGNISED EACH OTHER THE PRINCE EXCLAIMING IS IT POSSIBLE
6467-97061-0020 IS IT REALLY YOU MY DEAR FRIEND A HAHARA ALMAH WHO HAVE DONE THIS DEED
6467-97061-0021 THROUGH THESE THEY FORCE THEIR WAY EMPLOYING WITH GOOD EFFECTS THE WEAPONS PLACED ON THE ELEPHANT FOR THE USE OF GENDRAMA
6467-97061-0022 BEFORE HOWEVER THEY HAD GONE FAR THEY HEARD THE NOISE OF BATTLE AT AN DISTANCE AND SAW THE SOLDIERS IN FRONT OF THEM SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS
6467-97061-0023 WE HAVE JUST NOW ENCOUNTERED AND UTTERLY DEFEATED THE ENEMY SO THAT THERE IS NO FEAR OF ANY OTHER RESISTANCE
6467-97061-0024 RAJMANHA AGREED TO THIS
6599-38590-0000 WHATEVER KIND IT WAS THAT SHOT DOWN BOURBON ROME AFTER HIS DEATH WAS PLUNDERED DEVASTATED AND RAVAGED BY A BRUTAL GREEDY LICENTIOUS AND FANATICAL SOLDIERY

6599-38590-0002 SIR ANSWERED A SPANIARD PERMIT ME TO DO MY OFFICE AND SAY WHAT THE EMPEROR HAS CHARGED ME TO SAY
6599-38590-0003 NAY I WILL NOT LISTEN TO THEE SAID FRANCIS IF THOU DID NOT FIRST GIVE ME A PATENT SIGNED BY THY MASTER CONTAINING AN APPOINTMENT OF TIME AND PLACE SIR I HAVE ORDERS TO READ YOU THE CARTEL AND GIVE IT YOU AFTERWARDS
6599-38590-0004 BURGUNDY WITHOUT BEING PUT OUT BEGAN AGAIN HER
6599-38590-0005 NAY SAID FRANCES I WILL NOT SUFFER HIM TO SPEAK TO ME BEFORE HE HAD GIVEN ME APPOINTMENT OF TIME AND PLACE
6599-38590-0006 GIVE IT ME OR RETURN AS THOU HAST DONE
6599-38590-0007 I AM QUITE WILLING SAID THE KING AND LET HIM HAVE IT
6599-38590-0008 THE PIECE OF CAMBERY WAS CALLED THE LADY'S PIECE IN HONOUR OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO HAD NEGOTIATED IT THOUGH MORALLY DIFFERENT AND OF VERY UNEQUAL WORTH THEY BOTH HAD MINDS OF A RARE ORDER AND TRAINED TO RECOGNISE POLITICAL NECESSITIES AND NOT TO ATTEMPT ANY BUT POSSIBLE SUCCESSES
6599-38590-0009 ALL THE GREAT POLITICAL ACTORS SEEMED HURRYING AWAY FROM THE STAGE AS IF THE DRAMA WERE APPROACHING THEIR END
6599-38591-0000 IN FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO AT THE BATTLE OF DRUE HE WAS AGED AND SO ILL THAT NONE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM ON HORSEBACK
6599-38591-0001 HE FULLY ARMED SAVE ONLY HIS HEAD ANSWERED HIM RIGHT WELL SIR THIS IS THE REAL MEDICINE THAT HATH CURED ME FOR THE BATTLE WHICH IS TOWARD AND TO PREPARING FOR THE HONOUR OF GOD IN OUR CAMP
6599-38591-0002 THE LATTER'S PEACE CONCLUDED AT CAMBRAY IN FIFTEEN TWENTY NINE LASTED UP TO FIFTEEN THIRTY SIX INCESSANTLY TROUBLED HOWEVER BY FAR FROM PACIFIC SYMPTOMS PROCEEDINGS AND PREPARATIONS
6599-38591-0003 AT LAST HE DECIDED TO RETREATING
6599-38591-0004 IT WAS GARSILLASO DE LA VEGA THE PRINCE OF SPANISH POSEY THE SPANISH PATRIARCH ACCORDING TO HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN
6599-38591-0005 MONTMORENCY SOUNDED A SIMILAR ONE FOR PIEDMA
6599-38591-0006 THEY ALL REPAIRED TOGETHER TO THE HOUSE PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND AFTER DINNER THE EMPEROR BEING TIRED LAY DOWN TO REST ON A COUCH QUEEN ALEXANDER BEFORE LONG WENT AND TAPPED AT HIS DOOR AND SENT WORD TO THE KING THAT THE EMPEROR WAS AWAKE
6599-38591-0007 FRANCES WITH THE CARDINAL DE LORRAINE THE CONSTABLE DE MONTMORENCY SOON ARRIVED
6599-38591-0008 ON ENTERING THE CHAMBERS HE FOUND THE EMPEROR STILL LYING DOWN AND CHATTING WITH HIS SISTER THE QUEEN WHO WAS SEATED BESIDE HIM ON A CHAIR
6599-38591-0009 YES SIR CHARLES I HAD MADE SUCH CHEER THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SLEEP IT OFF
6599-38591-0010 FRANCIS DID THEIR CONVERSE WITH HIS OWN COLLAR
6599-38591-0011 ONLY SEVEN OF THE ATTENDANTS REMAINED IN THE EMPEROR'S CHAMBER AND THERE THE TWO SERGEANTS CONVERSED FOR AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THEY MOVED TO THE HALL WHERE A SPLENDID SUPPER AWAITED THEM
6599-38591-0012 THE GINTIS PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE HAVE RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ACCESSION
6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DROPPED BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SMILE
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALLED A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BETWEEN DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S EYESL BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMUDA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDON CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE COWS WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT O THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE SMALL GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DID GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE KRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASE WOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MEN BUILDING A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIDE GATE AND ENTERED IT
6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J P STAMPING IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE FENCE SMOKING CIGARETTE AND CHATTING TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED ACROSS THE ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOOD AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE ON AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE COULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
6841-88291-0013 HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SAT OVER IN ONE STRIP TO AVOID THE TIGHTENED LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE SALF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HOUSE STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 AND TWO BULL DOGGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCE UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLULLED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 THUS THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STUMBLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU FOR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE WOLF DOGGERS
6841-88291-0021 MARKER YELLED THE OTHERS
6841-88291-0022 THE BRANDS PRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF BLAD A LITTLE LEST THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRANSHOW CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOUR TO INDICATE DUE PEELING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 AND HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOWTAIL ON THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDY
6841-88291-0027 UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT PAINFUL AND COULD SOME OTHER METHODS OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADOPT IT IN PREFERENCE
6841-88291-0028 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THE SPREAD OF THIS DOCTRINE TOWARD ARIZONA
6841-88291-0029 IMAGINE THE PUNCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TAGS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR IN A ROUNDUP
6841-88291-0030 A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEEDING OR TO MAKING IDLY ABOUT
6841-88291-0031 BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT DIGNIFIED TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD OUR TEETH FILLED
6841-88291-0032 ONE OF THESE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS BUT A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEGS BUT TOSSED HIS LOOP OVER ITS NECK
6841-88291-0033 MISTER FROST'S BULL CALF ALONE IN PICTORIAL HISTORY SHOWS THE ATTRIBUTES
6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERMUTABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER
6841-88291-0035 AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OUT PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HELD
6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD CATCH HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE VIGOROUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING BACK THE UPRIGHT
6841-88291-0037 YOU CAN IMAGINE WHATEVER HAPPENED NEXT
6841-88291-0038 THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME FUN YET IT FAILS
6841-88291-0039 BY NOW THE BRANDUM WAS IN FULL SWING
6841-88291-0040 WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID THE CAST SAIL
6841-88291-0041 MEN RAN TO AND FRO BUSY AND IMPORTANT
6841-88291-0042 AND SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR CALVES WERE ON THE GROUND AT ONCE
6841-88291-0043 DUST HARDIED AND DISSIPATED
6841-88291-0044 NO MORE NICKS CALVES THEY ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0045 THEN WE WOULD SPIT ON HIS HANDS AND GO AT IT ALONE
6841-88291-0046 OF LUCK ATTENDED HIS FIRST EFFORT HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND THERE'S YOUR LITTLE CALF SAID HE
6841-88291-0047 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THAT FAR WITH YOUR LITTLE LOW IRON
6841-88291-0048 TOWARD NOON THE WEATHER SLACKED
6841-88291-0049 FINALLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMAN AND REPORTED THE BANDON FINISHED
6841-88291-0050 THE LATTER COUNTED THE MARKS IN HER TALLY BOOK
6841-88291-0051 ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX HE ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0052 THE MARKERS SQUATTED ON THE HEELS TOLD OVER THE BITS OF EARS THEY HAD SAVED
6841-88291-0053 THE TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
6841-88291-0054 FINALLY WOODLAND DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HIP POCKET
6841-88291-0055 THEY HAD BEEN DOING A WRESTLER'S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNING BUT DO NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED
6841-88291-0056 I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN'S AND THAT IT EXERCISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF HIS BODY
6841-88294-0000 AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THAT STORM ON THE ROOF CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EAVES
6841-88294-0001 WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKING OUT TO A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL
6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEEL FROM CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN MY LEFT LEG
6841-88294-0003 THEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD COST ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND
6841-88294-0004 IN PLACE OF IT HE WORE A SHARP STEEL LOOK
6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHING HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GITS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DON'T SOUND GOOD
6841-88294-0006 WHERE A MAN BREATHES THAT WAY HE'S MOSTLY ALL GONE
6841-88294-0007 MEN GOT BATTED OVER THE SIDE OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
6841-88294-0008 SOUR WINE IS FINE TER PUT A WOUND IN SHAPE TO HEEL BUT IT'S NO SOOTHIN SYRUP
6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRAVE IT WAS THE SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTERS THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEA DONE ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBAREE
6841-88294-0010 IT FAIR MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH THE BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE AND THE QUIET MOONLIGHT IN THE SHADOWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZONING EACH SIDE HIS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER A RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I MADE UP TO GET HIM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AND PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP
6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN HE'D SING THAT BARBARY SONG UNTIL I'D GO OUT AN LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWIN BY JIST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DIED AN GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE'D JEST TALK
6841-88294-0013 HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND HE KEPT HIS SIDE OF CONVERSATIONS PAUSING FOR REPLIES
6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THE HOUR BUT I NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE'D COME FROM NOR WHAT HE'D DONE
6841-88294-0015 I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO UN FOR HE WAS QUIET
6841-88294-0016 USUALLY I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING WITH SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
6841-88294-0017 HE IS LYING ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES I ASKED VERY INTENSE
6841-88294-0019 ONE LITTLE SQUEEZE TALK AROUND YOUR DEADLY WEAPONS
6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'S BEEN TOO SICK AND TOO LONG A BED
6841-88294-0021 IN A MINUTE OR SO HE CAME TO YOU
6841-88294-0022 NOW YE'RE A NICE SWEET PROPOSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
6841-88294-0023 WE'RE SAFE ENOUGH LET ME HAVE THEM HE BEGGED
6841-88294-0024 NOW LOOK HERE SAID HE YOU CAN'T GET UP TO DAY YOU AIN'T FIT
6841-88294-0025 I KNOW SHE PLEADED BUT LET ME SEE THEM
6841-88294-0026 JUST TO SATISFY HIM I PASSED OVER HIS OLD BUDS
6841-88294-0027 I'VE BEEN ROBBED SHE CALLED
6841-88294-0028 WHERE'S MY COACH HE ASKED
6841-88294-0029 YOU HAD NO COAT WHEN I PAID YOU UP I REPLIED
6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED AT ME MIGHTY SUSPICIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WON'T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
6841-88294-0031 AFTER HE'D EATEN A FAT MEAL HE FELL ASLEEP
6841-88294-0032 WHEN I CAME BACK THAT EVENING THE BUNK WAS EMPTY AND I WAS GONE
6841-88294-0033 I DIDN'T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR TWO WEEKS
6841-88294-0034 THEN HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM QUITE A WAYS OFF
6841-88294-0035 GUESS HE'S SUSPICIOUS I STOLE THAT OLD COAT OF HIS THINKS I AN AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT
6841-88294-0036 HOWEVER HE DIDN'T REMAIN LONG IN THAT FRAME OF MIND
6841-88294-0037 I RAN UP PULLEN MY GUN
6841-88294-0038 THEN MEX WAS FLAT ON HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
6841-88294-0039 ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK KNELT MY ONE ARM
6841-88294-0040 ANYWAY I THRUST THE MUZZLE OF MY COLT INTO THE SAILOR'S FACE WHAT'S THIS I SAW
6841-88294-0041 I WEEN HIM ET MONTE OF ANTONIO CARVAZ SAID HE
6841-88294-0042 THE GLEAM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SNARL BURST HIS LIPS
6841-88294-0043 IN ANY CASE HE FLEW COCO PRONTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
6841-88294-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL AROUND TOWN MOSTLY DOING ODD JOBS I SAW HIM OFF AND ON
6841-88294-0045 HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THE TIME ALMIGHTY BUSY HOLDING DOWN OUR CARD GAMES
6841-88294-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YO'D BETTER STAY RIGHT THERE
6841-88294-0047 I WANT TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE HE
6841-88294-0048 WHAT KIND OF GOOD THING I ASKED A TREASURE SAID HE

6841-88294-0052 AND IT'S A BIG THING SAID HANDY SOLOMON TO ME FOR THERE'S NOT ONLY GOLD BUT ULTRA JEWELS AN DI'MONDS
6841-88294-0053 THAT WILL MAKE US RICH AND A DOZEN LIKE US AND YOU CAN KISS THE BOOK ON THAT
6841-88294-0054 THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT WHY DO YOU LOVE ME
6841-88294-0055 WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR TREASURE WITHOUT THE NEEDS OF DIVIDING IT
6841-88294-0056 WHY MY MATE HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAIN GRATITUDE
6841-88294-0057 DIDN'T YOU SAVE MY LIFE AND NUSS ME AND TAKE CARE OF ME AND I WAS NOT KILLED
6841-88294-0058 LOOK HERE ANDERSON OR HANDY SOLOMON OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO CALL YOURSELF I REJOINED TO THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK STRAIGHT
6841-88294-0059 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY GRATITUDE BUT THEY DON'T GO WITH ME
6841-88294-0060 THE DEVIL'S A PREACHER IF YOU AIN'T LOST YOUR MEN FEATHERS SAID HE
6841-88294-0061 WELL IT'S THIS THEN I GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GET THERE AND SHE MUST BE STUCK
6841-88294-0062 AND I GOT TO HAVE HELP WITH A TREASURE IF IT'S LIKE THIS FELLOW SAID IT WAS
6841-88294-0063 IT'S MONEY I'D GOT TO HAVE AND IT'S MONEY I HAVEN'T GOT AND CAN'T GET UNLESS I LETS SOMEBODY IN AS PARDNER
6841-88294-0064 WHY MEN I ASKED WHY NOT HE RETORTED
6841-88294-0065 AND WE TALKED THE MATTER OVER AT LENGTH
6841-88294-0066 HE STOOD OUT FOR A LARGER PARTY
6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS AS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT I HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING AGAIN INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY WE COMPROMISED
6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THE TREASURE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST IS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SCHEME DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
700-122866-0000 JUNIER AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE AGAIN
700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLE TO EVERYDAY LIFE
700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARGARET DISAPPROVES OF THEM
700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST THEN THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE SENSIBLE YET
700-122866-0004 I JUST LAY AWAKE AN IMAGINED THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVES AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTS
700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAMME AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERTY
700-122866-0007 BUT THE WINTER WEEKS SLIP BY
700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THE CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON READ A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT
700-122866-0009 I CANNOT SCARCELY REALIZE THAT I AM IN MY TEENS
700-122866-0010 IT'S A GOOD COMFORT TO THINK THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT
700-122866-0011 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BETS SAID ANNE DISDAINFULLY
700-122866-0012 SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN SOME ONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN A TAKE NOTICE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
700-122866-0013 I' AM TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLEN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE'S PERFECT
700-122866-0014 IF I HAD ALICE BULL'S CROOKED NOSE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY I WOULDN'T BUT THERE
700-122866-0015 I'M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMPLEMENT ABOUT THAT LONG AGO

700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMIN PRETTY DREAMS
700-122866-0018 I HEARD IT LAST MONDAY EVENING
700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR IN DEBT NOT DIVIDED
700-122866-0020 I READ IT TO REBECCA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF AND NONSENSE
700-122866-0021 BUT IT'S A SAD SWEET STORY
700-122866-0022 CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORNETTE OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DUSKLY FLASHING EYES
700-122866-0023 YOU KNOW VERY MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE
700-122866-0024 THEY GREW IN BEAUTYS SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE SIXTEEN
700-122866-0025 I ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY UPON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED
700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FRIEND THIS SAME AS EVER
700-122866-0027 LET'S YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CLUB ALL OUR OWN AND WRITE STORY FOR PRACTICE
700-122866-0028 YOU OUGHT TO CULTIVATE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS STACEY SAYS SO
700-122866-0029 THOUGH WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT WAY
700-122866-0030 THIS WAS HOW THE STORY BOOK CAME INTO EXISTENCE
700-122866-0031 NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION COULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MEMBER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK
700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO READ OUR STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN WE TALK IT OVER
700-122866-0033 MINE IS ROSAMONDE MONTMORENCYRA ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
700-122866-0034 I'M SURE THAT MAY HAVE A WHOLESOME EFFECT
700-122866-0035 THE MORAL IS THE REAL THING MISTER ALLEN SAYS SO
700-122866-0036 I WROTE ONE OF MY STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLEN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MORAL WAS EXCELLENT
700-122866-0037 JANE AND RUBY ALSO ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC PARTS
700-122866-0038 MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAVE NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE
700-122866-0039 I'M SURE MISSUS ALLAN WAS NOT SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE
700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I HEARD HIM
700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE ALWAYS FELT SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANYTHING EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE
700-122866-0042 NOW YOU WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
700-122867-0000 VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT ARE
700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ALREADY IN THE LAND AND MARILLA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL GLADNESS
700-122867-0002 I MUST SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT AND UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW
700-122867-0003 PERHAPS YOU'RE JUDGING HER TOO HASTILY MAMMA
700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HER PART MATTHEW BUT I M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU
700-122867-0005 DEMANDED RAOUL ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO THE BED
700-122867-0006 ANNA COWERED DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOR EVER FROM MORTAL EYES NO
700-122867-0007 GET RIGHT UP A MINUTE AND TELL ME
700-122867-0008 THIS MINUTE I SAY THERE NOW WHAT
700-122867-0009 VAN HAD SLID TO THE FLOOR IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE
700-122867-0010 YES IT'S PRETTY MOANED ANNE
700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS SAD AS RED HAIR
700-122867-0012 I HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR EVER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
700-122867-0013 NOW THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR FATHER
700-122867-0014 M SHIRLEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO
700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE QUICK ADMITTED ANNE
700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DADDYN
700-122867-0017 AND MISS ALLEN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANY ONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT
700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T YET AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY
700-122867-0019 WHO SAID WHO ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT
700-122867-0020 ONLY I DIDN'T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE
700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL AND RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE
700-122867-0022 OH AMELIA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTISE TO DECEIVE
700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MIGHT BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
700-122867-0024 WITH A SIMILAR SIGH SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSORS
700-122867-0025 BUT THERE'S NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HEAD CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT A DREADFUL COLOR IS THERE
700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO WEEP ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF IT WONT INTERFERE
700-122867-0027 IT SEEMED SUCH A TRAGIC
700-122867-0028 ANNE WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASSES SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
700-122867-0029 YES YOU WILL TOO
700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I THINK I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURLING
700-122867-0031 I EXPECT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO MY NOSE NEXT
700-122867-0032 NAN'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCARE SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I WOULDN'T
700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE WOULDN'T IT
700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS AND I NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE RIGHT
700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLAN AND MISS STACY AND GROWN UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU
700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HEAD BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON ROUND MY HEAD WITH A BOW AT ONE SIDE
700-122867-0039 I WILL CALLED IT A SNOOD THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
700-122867-0040 MY HEAD IS DEAD NOW
700-122867-0041 IT WAS TOO BAD THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH
700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE JANE SAID DIANA
700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED MARY ANDREWS BUT I KNOW THAT I COULDN'T KEEP STILL
700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A RED HEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNIE
700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS A LIVELY MAN
700-122868-0004 MY COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LIKED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANNE'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATIZE A LANE
700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THEIR PRESENT
700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING A GAME
700-122868-0009 THE BLACK SHELL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPED IT OVER THE FLOOD AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
700-122868-0010 BUT IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
700-122868-0011 WHEN YOU ARRANGES
700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE WAS DEAD
700-122868-0013 JANE ROSE TO THE CASE
700-122868-0014 LEFT BEHIND AT OUR LANDING
700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER KNEW SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
700-122868-0016 THERE IS ONE CHANGE JUST ONE
700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWER OF PRAYER
700-122868-0018 THE FLAT DRIFTED UNDER THE BRIG AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MID STREAM
700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY WEIGHING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NO DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY WITHOUT SEEMING LIKE AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAID
700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T EVERYBODY COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SKETCH ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES TO HER
700-122868-0023 AND SHIRLI
700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET BACK THERE HE EXCLAIMED
700-122868-0025 IT WAS SUDDENLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MAD
700-122868-0027 ASK GILBERT TAKING UP HIS OARS
700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT IN THE BARGE I MEAN THE SPOT
700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT ANNEN HESITATED
700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK PROUD LITTLE BEAT
700-122868-0031 A RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COOLLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
700-122868-0033 ARE RIGHT
700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN NOW SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL IT
700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS IN TO ESCAPE
700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO
700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE THEN GROANED MARILLA
700-122868-0039 I DON'T THINK HOW SAID MARILLA
700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I HAVE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF SOME GREAT SHORTCOMINGS
7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING OF IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IPSOPHYLICITAS SE NISCITEMPERAT PREMISE EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND TO CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE IS NO MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING IT YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF SOCIETY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THE SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS
7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIVES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS THOUGH OF LESS OR GREATER WEIGHT
7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNATURAL PEOPLE AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAINED WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE
7601-101622-0001 AND IF WE SUFFER THE ILLS OF A LONG PIECE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR
7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF SMALL YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PAY
7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSE TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN IS WHAT PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
7601-101622-0004 PRINCESS TAKE THE HONOURS DELAYED FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
7601-101622-0005 LET BEASTE'S BLOOD STAIN THE INFAMOUS ARENA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND TO DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION UPON RECEIVING THEIR DEATH
7601-101622-0007 THE VERY GIRLS THEMSELVES SET THEM
7601-175351-0000 WHAT BEGINNING OF REVOLT
7601-175351-0001 AT THAT UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARD THE FORWARD
7601-175351-0002 LIGHT HER FIRES EXCLAIMED SOME
7601-175351-0003 WHAT WITH AS OTHERS
7601-175351-0004 AND TO STUFF THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED WARREN
7601-175351-0005 WOULD YOU HEAR ME
7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE CRIED HATTERAS AND
7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PENNER ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN
7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED BEN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FARTHER
7601-175351-0009 YOU SHA'N'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WATER AND THEY SHAN'T LIGHT THE FIRES
7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEATED WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN AND GUARDED
7601-175351-0011 A MURMUR WAS REACHED
7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOVER AND WARREL WENT DOWN TO HIS POST
7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON BROUGHT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERED AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROW
7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BERING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWDING TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
7601-175351-0015 I'M TRYING NOT TO ANSWERED WALL
7601-175351-0016 HATTERAS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD GONE
7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS AS APOCRYPHALE
7601-175351-0018 AND NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREYLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS ENJOYED ON DECK BRAVING THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
7601-175351-0021 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO EDUCATE THEM I THINK
7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAWBONNY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE BUT ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED ME
7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WILL MISS CLAWBONNY
7601-175351-0025 I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE
7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRENELL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED OF THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITANNIA A MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCYDIDES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HINTS WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE A FAVOURITE THAT HIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE SURE SUBJECTS FOR THE HISTORIC PEN
7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDED UNTO HEAVEN
7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATING AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES
7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AND APOTHEGMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SPIOLIA OPINA
7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRADES
7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKEJACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHERCOCKS THAT TURNED AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONGHEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIVES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTLE
7641-96252-0000 THUS WHEN DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILL REMAINS STILL THE SAME
7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY WERE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED INTO DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE WHEEL AND ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF A FAMILY
7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF A WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALL TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BLONDS FOR A FLEETING AND ELUSIVE PHENOMENON
7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY ALWAYS IN THE SUFFERER
7641-96252-0008 BUT THE OTHER IS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE SYMPTOM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITE OF THE STEIN OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH AS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES OF A WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOTS OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL ONE YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SERENITY OF DISPOSITION
7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH HAS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE
7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALIZE THEMSELVES WHILST THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO AUGHT OR A LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERRING THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO THEIR OWN
7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTWEIGH THE REGARD OF ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SOCRATES AND GIORDONO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTH SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HANDS OF THE PRIESTS
7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS UNDOUBTEDLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES OR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE
7641-96252-0019 IT WAS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPACITY FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON IMAGINATION
7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVING TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THAT SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING THAT WAS TO THIS MAN A WISH FOR DELIVERANCE
7641-96670-0000 THERE WERE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SESASTRAS STAYED IN THE CITY OF EA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN HER RISING AND SETTING
7641-96670-0002 MEDIA TOO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE WIND
7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF CROTHEUS AND CRETHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMAS THEIR GRANDFATHER
7641-96670-0004 JASON TOOK PELYAS AND TELAMON WITH HIM
7641-96670-0005 AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MISTS FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHRIXUS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
7641-96670-0006 THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PALACE IN THE WHITE LIGHT OF THE MORNING
7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KENAEUS LIVED WITH OBSYRTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDEIA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS
7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEYA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FASES
7641-96670-0010 WITHIN HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE
7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SARMATII
7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR US
7641-96670-0013 IDA'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
7641-96670-0014 AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID OH
7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE MIGHT MAKE OF THEM
7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE AMERICANS
7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL FOR YOU
7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY THEN SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE WITH HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
7641-96670-0020 KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ARAS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS
7641-96670-0021 THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GAVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON
7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH IT THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE
7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY PARTY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST EYES UPON THE GROUND
7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS THING AS IT IS
7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDIA GREW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
7641-96670-0027 PHRONTIS AND MELAS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
7641-96684-0000 AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO OUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED ON ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING
7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THAT ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
7641-96684-0003 HEREAFTER ADMETUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE THERE WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
7641-96684-0005 FOR APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID NEDMETUS
7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT IS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOW THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR LOOK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS AND MEDUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING FOR YOU
7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACES WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0012 AND THEN WE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER HATTED HAIR
7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AS HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH A HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
7641-96684-0016 ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOATHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
7641-96684-0017 THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO THE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO TO YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KEEN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
7641-96684-0019 NOW THE SHIPS SEEMED TO STOP
7641-96684-0020 IT WAS SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
7641-96684-0021 AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR IT
7641-96684-0023 NO NOT FOR YE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE
7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THAT BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
7641-96684-0025 AND NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM HER
7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF THE TERRIBLE LOSS
7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD IS NOT SACRIFICE DUE
7641-96684-0028 AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER MARRIAGE WAS BEFORE HIM
7641-96684-0029 IVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD YOU NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THEEN IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
7641-96684-0032 HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS WHEN HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISED TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD COULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER
7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGS BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY
7641-96684-0037 THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE AT PAINS ENOUGH
7641-96684-0038 THEN ADMETUS LAID THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THIS GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTIONS AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION
7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STAYS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR THE MAN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
7697-105815-0005 AND CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGER ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MEN TO SWEEP IT
7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THEN
7697-105815-0008 THEN YOU NEXT SAW A MAID COME IN TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAID IT LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAUSS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LOW THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED MOUSE BLESSED TOMB
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAIN ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO GO
7697-105815-0014 FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZUION FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 KNOW YOURE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG YOUTHS HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
7697-105815-0017 WELL SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE'RE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ACTS
7697-105815-0019 IS NOT A CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW NOW THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE STREAM OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP IS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMAER SAID THAT ZAYING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YET SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT ON HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND HE NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROSS
7697-105815-0028 OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHIW HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THESE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS SLEEP
7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR MIGHT I HAD BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW THE SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT ON HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HATH GOT BACK HIS SCROUGH
7697-105815-0033 HE LAID IT UP IN A BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAMP THE HILL
7697-105815-0035 AH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRING IN THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THE HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS MY STRENGTH SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITHS OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH BUT NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY UNTIL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE THE WATCHFUL DWELT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS HIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD GONE THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT ALONG TO THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0043 HIGHIDE COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AN I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT THIANE
7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE WORLD
7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES HAVE
7697-105815-0048 CHARITY WELL WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAD ME LEAVE THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS THE PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JOHN BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS IN THE SLAIN AND THE STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS PLANT SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANUS LANDS
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THESE HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 THE JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE IS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE TO THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID CIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THAT FIELD
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVED THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT THAT IS FOR OUR GOOD
7697-105817-0008 CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO LOOK BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SAID DRY IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIVE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AND THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FORD
7697-105817-0011 AND BY THIS ACT WE CURE OUR SORROWS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOUR WHETHER IN THE STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
7697-245712-0001 THOUGH IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING SOBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOW MUCH GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A KNOWLEDGE OF MEN AND OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAST IT IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NECESSARY
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON HIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET THE ANIMALS OF MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A FIT MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN HER SAFE INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATEMAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEANER OVER PLANS
7697-245712-0013 NOW EMEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX SINCE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNI HAVE BEEN STERILE
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISSPARITY
7697-245712-0016 AN EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTS OF NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THAT STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE ONLY HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS THE FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE IS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT SHE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS
8173-294714-0002 HE HAD LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS ROYAL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENSE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKE MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHILE HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT THE HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE CALLED
8173-294714-0008 YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW WHAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL YOURS
8173-294714-0009 WHAT WRONG ARE THEY TALKING OF
8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHILE VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL
8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I SHALL EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING DOWN THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAYS
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS MUCH PRIDE AS A CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH AN POSITION AS MINE
8173-294714-0016 A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A HAWK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR A FOOD AND SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIES THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HATH BEEN FORCED AWAY
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE HER WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO CAN DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD IN THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WICKEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 HOW WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CANNOT YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF IT
8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED AND SPOKE IN IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOST AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATIONS
8173-294714-0028 I I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 DO LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN
8173-294714-0030 IT IS CERTAIN TO BE YOUR ONLY FRIEND
8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YE
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT WE HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH
8173-294714-0033 MAKE ME LONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING HE REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRANDY
8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAK OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 BUT WHY NEED YOU HESITATE
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I COULD NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETIES
8173-294714-0039 NEITHER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR ITS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS THIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 AND UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE POOR WORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A GENTLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT A DIRECT INTEREST AT HER DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THOUGH ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS THE MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD TAKE IT
8173-294714-0048 YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN I REMARKED
8173-294714-0049 I AM ALWAYS DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT SHALL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE
8173-294714-0051 WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SADLY
8173-294714-0052 WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF THEIR LAWYERS
8173-294714-0053 THESE ARE TRUSTWORTHY AND EXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
8173-294714-0054 CAUTIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSED HERSELF HER DELICACY TOOK THE ALARM
8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU FROM MISTER VAN BRANDT SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR OFFER GRATEFULLY
8173-294714-0056 I COULD HONESTLY PROMISE WHAT
8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING TO HER KNOWLEDGE THE COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO WHILE HIS RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
8173-294714-0059 YOU KISS ME SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU GO
8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY YOUR OWN GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERS ME
8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR HER JOURNEY
8254-115543-0001 EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF COMFORTABLE ORDERS
8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DRINKING AND SCOLDING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON
8254-115543-0003 THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION WHEN AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT FROM THE GATEWAY
8254-115543-0004 BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER IN HER DULY BLACK A SORT OF A LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SEWN BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES
8254-115543-0005 BESIDES THE FAMILY THERE ARE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THE SLOW MOVING WAGON
8254-115543-0006 THE CLERK TOO WENT WITH THEM

8254-115543-0008 THEY SHOUTED GREETINGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE POTTER AS THEY PASSED HIM AND ALSO TO THE OLD FAKIR SMEARED ALL OVER WITH ASHES WHO SAT IN A LITTLE BRICK HUT BY THE RIVER AND PRETENDED TO MAKE WONDERFUL CURES
8254-115543-0009 THAT IS MORE FUN THAN GOING TO SCHOOL SAIDCOLA AS THE OXEN PLODDED ALONG THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
8254-115543-0010 THESE LOVELY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS ARE QUITE WILD
8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEADS THAT HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS
8254-115543-0012 AS THE WAGON CAME UP A YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THE HOLY MEN RAN UP AND HELD OUT A BEGGING BOWL SAYING GIVE O CHARITABLE PEOPLE TO THIS HOLY ONE
8254-115543-0013 NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MANY BEGGARS AS AMERICA
8254-115543-0014 MANY OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE INTO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM
8254-115543-0015 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEAR IT
8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THEY ARE DOG SAID MAHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CANE DOWN BY A STREAM
8254-115543-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN BUY SOME FROM THE MAN THERE HE IS NOW PLOWING BY THE STREAM SAID COLIN
8254-115543-0018 IT IS LOOKING FOR WATER SAID THE FARMER AS HE TOOK A LAST STOCK OF CANE AND GENTLY GUIDED IT DOWN THE STREAM
8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS ANOTHER SACRED ANIMAL OF THE HINDUS AND THEY WILL NOT KILL OR INJURE ONE FOR ANYTHING
8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WAS ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD
8254-115543-0021 IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING IN STATE ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJA OR RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MODERN INDIA WAS FORMERLY MADE
8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT ALL DECORATED WITH SILK OF GOLD AND SILVER
8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS A HOWDAH WHICH WAS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS A RAJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLOURED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN
8254-115543-0024 BEHIND THE HOWDAH STOOD A SERVANT HOLDING A BIG UMBRELLA OF FINE FEATHERS ABOVE THE RAJAH'S HEAD
8254-115543-0025 THE DRIVER SAT ON THE NECK OF THE ELEPHANT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST BY PRODDING IT ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN IRON SHOD STICK OR GOAD
8254-115543-0026 ISN'T IT FINE TO RIDE LIKE THAT ON A BLUE ELEPHANT
8254-115543-0027 ALL THE REST OF THE DAY THE LITTLE FOLKS TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE GREAT RAJA AND HIS ESCORT
8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS AND BARGAINING FOR FOOD AT A LITTLE BOOTH
8254-115543-0029 THESE THEY USED FOR PLATES HEAPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICE AND CURRY AND FISH AND ALL SORTS OF PUDDINGS AND SWEET
8254-115543-0030 A SUPPER WAS BEING EATEN ANOTHER PARTY STOPPED AT THE PIRAL ENCAMPED NOT FAR AWAY
8254-115543-0031 WHEN A LITTER WAS PUT DOWN A YOUNG BOY STEPPED OUT LOOKING VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY
8254-115543-0032 HIS SERVANTS AT ONCE SPREAD A HANDSOME RUG UPON THE GROUND FOR HIM TO SIT ON AND RUSHED ABOUT WAITING ON HIM TAKING GOOD CARE TO KEEP EVERY ONE AT A DISTANCE
8254-115543-0033 YES AND HOW HE ORDERS EVERYONE ABOUT THEM
8254-115543-0034 ROUND THE LITTLE BRAHMIN'S NECK WAS A THIN CORD OR THREAD WHICH IS THE SIGN OF HIS HIGH CASTE
8254-115543-0035 MEANTIME THE HAUGHTY LITTLE BRAHMIN ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HIS HEAD TURNED AWAY SO NO ONE COULD SEE HIM EAT AND THEN GROWING TIRED OF RESPECTFUL GLANCES OF THE CROWD AROUND HIM HE GOT INTO HIS LITTER AGAIN AND THE SERVANTS FASTENED THE CURTAINS TIGHTLY ROUND HIM
8254-115543-0036 EVERYBODY SLEPT SOUNDLY IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE SERVANTS WAS BEATING A DRUM MOST OF THAT NIGHT WHICH THEY REALLY BELIEVED WAS A WAY TO KEEP OFF EVIL SPIRITS
8254-115543-0037 ONLY THE THIEVES HE CRIED
