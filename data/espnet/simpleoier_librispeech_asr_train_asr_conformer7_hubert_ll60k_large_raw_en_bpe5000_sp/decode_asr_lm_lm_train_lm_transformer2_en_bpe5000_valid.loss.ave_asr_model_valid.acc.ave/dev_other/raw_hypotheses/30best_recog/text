116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD THE BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WINDING HER WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND A HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND IT PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SADLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY WORTHY GUIDE
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CONDUCT THE WORSHIP BUT I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AN IDOL I WHISPERED TAKEN BY THE SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPPED GODS HE DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAMBERING IN MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NO THEY SAID IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDOL THEN AND NOT A GUIDE
116-288045-0011 IT MADE ATHENS A CITY OF LIGHT IT CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR WISDOM WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT I INTERRUPTED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANSWER WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 INTRODUCTION
116-288045-0015 I WHISPERED TO MYSELF WHAT BLASHEMY
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINE OF HOMER CONCERNING THE DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT OF HOMER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOMER THE INSPIRED BARD OH
116-288045-0019 AND NO NO APOLLO IS NOT AN IDOL
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AND THE SON OF MY GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE IN VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MIEN OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT MY PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTHDAY OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH A SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY TO HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 BUT THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AN IDOL
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWERING TO HIS NAME FOR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN TURN TOWARDS HIM
116-288045-0027 WILL HE NOT BE HERE SOME MORNING
116-288045-0028 AND WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASP HIS DIVINE HEAD TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I SAW MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF AN IDOL AS APOLLO AND
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIMSELF A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CANDIED DISCUSSION ON A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN A MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY GIVE FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERY THING THAT WAS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 THOUGH I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE DOES NOT BUILT UP IS ANOTHER CRITICISM OF MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OR PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTING
116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTH IN A JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF THE SERPENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRINNEL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT IS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNTING YOUR RITES POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WISH HE WOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 BUT FIRST LET US BE IMPERSONAL THE EPITHETS IRREVERENT BLASPHEMER ATHEIST AND INFIDELS ARE FLUNG AT A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM ENVY
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WETTING THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WET HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST ANIMATED BY THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BY CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 A MYTH IS A FANCIVAL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 MY MIND CRAVES FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN INBORN DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME IN CLOSE ENOUGH TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS MIHOS THE PRIMITIVE MAN WAS SATISFIED UNTIL HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALISED ITS INADEQUACY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALIZATION
116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN INDIA HAD BEEN REPLACED BY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE HINDOOS
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH THE MYTHS HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IF JESUS A MYTH
116-288047-0007 THERE IS IN MAN A FACULTY FOR FICTION A
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS THAN WE GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BIT INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURBING ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RELENTLESS PERIOD
116-288047-0010 WE FILL THE SPACE ALL ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE AND AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 WE COVET THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR A MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET DO NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION AND
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN IF MAN HAD MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROWN UP PEOPLE ALL CREATE SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND HENCE OF MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THIS TABLE IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SCIENCE OF THE TOWN
116-288047-0018 IN MY DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 THAT HE IS GOD'S MOUTHPIECE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND HIS RESPECT IS TO BE REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE SAVAGE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOR IN HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DATES WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES ON THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPELS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 WELL THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 WHY IS DISCREPANCY IN THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO GIVE THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THESE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS ABOUT JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 HOW IT IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON LOVES THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAC AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN AUSTRALIO HAS BECOME THE CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE OREGEN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SKEPTICAL CELSIS ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISTS IN JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE QUESTIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW AND WAS MARK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDAH AND MARY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS EASILY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROMAN WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF THAT MYTH
116-288048-0016 HE WERE THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS UPON THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF THIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD YOU HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 WHY ELSE IS THIS UNANIMOUS SCIENCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN THE VOTES
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FEAR IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BY THE SWORD NOW AND BY HELL FIRE HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JUDAS
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON ITS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLATS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE OF THESE PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF DELUDED PROPHETS THE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISE
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH THE PREACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARRIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THE PERMISSION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT SHE SAID IF YE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MEAN AS WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS A REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY LIBERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED OVER AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR METEIA OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALLS OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS A RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUNDED WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE EARTH
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED A HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH OFTEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD OH
1255-138279-0008 TWO THE THREE
1255-138279-0009 FOUR TO FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED UPON HALF A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOTT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARD THE FIFTH WINDOWS
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDLAND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY COLLECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW WAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MATTER
1255-138279-0015 THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF AN WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 NO SAID THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME OH
1255-138279-0018 WELL I SAID THAT HE MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 OH MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED
1255-138279-0020 FOR I HAVE MONEY
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WHAT THEM
1255-138279-0022 IF WE SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK WHY
1255-138279-0024 GOOD NIGHT FRANKY GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 OH THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNTESS HAD NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY MISS JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND MUST DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL ASKED FOR SOME DELAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED AND
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS DEEP AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THE HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR A LOVELL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THEY ARE POLES ASUNDER OF ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT FOR YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF WORTH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE A MASTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND WILL TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOILS MISTER THWAITE SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR YOUR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER HERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU REALLY WISH IT HE SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN O LASS ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN AND EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I'D SOONER SEE YOU DARN MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEET HEART
1255-74899-0021 I CAN DO YOU THAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AND NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LADY
1255-90407-0000 HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN INTOWARD TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE LANE GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HEQUIRED
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW HE SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT BEST
1255-90407-0005 IF I SHOULD THINK SO
1255-90407-0006 OH HE'S MY FATHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND FOR THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER'S IS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD
1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A GOOD BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'VE HEARD HOW
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T MEAN HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 BUT MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 WAS THAT THIS EVEN
1255-90407-0014 THERE ON THE NETTLES THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE CAPEULETS
1255-90407-0016 SO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO OLD THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND IT WAS AN ISLAND STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND AS SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT THAT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITH THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS ONE IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL YOUR SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND WAITING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARDS HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PEIRSON
1255-90407-0028 HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WAR
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HER HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVES CARRO
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS HIM CLOSE AND SATISFIES
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINEVIN'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHERS COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WAS NOT AT ALL
1255-90413-0004 BUT WHY WAS HE ABLE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY MANAGED
1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO HOLD IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL NIGHT AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELLE POOL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING BY A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD HEIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED OUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH A GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE WHISPERED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN THERE SOMETIMES OH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN RESPONSE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER MORE UNCIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HER WAY OUT AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANELSLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSCELYN PIERSTERTON
1255-90413-0019 OH DIDN'T THEY MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE AVEAN WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH MUCH STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMP LIGHT NICOLA PINE AVEN
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN ON THE FIRST ARRIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED INTO THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 THEY HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAZED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FROM THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM A WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF THE INVENTOR IS HEART
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT THE DISTRESSFUL COSTS OF PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESOLVE IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN WAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGIS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVEALED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING A HIGHER GOOD AND AT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSITIVELY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THEIR ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN RICKENING FAST
1585-131718-0007 YES THE VERY VOGUAL OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHTS MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTNING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISES FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR THE STREET LINING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND INCURRING FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SIX PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY APPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL CITIZENS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ANDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES AND THE LEADING CITIES
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS ROOM
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS FELT
1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCLEYDE BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN IS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN IN ITS ENEMIES
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HUNDREDS OF SITTARS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN A NEW YORK ITSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OBSERVATIONS OF WHICH THERE WERE PLENTY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILLS
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENIAL INTERESTS WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AN ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM AND THE BALLASTON WATTGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WILL SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT OFF TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE WITH EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLUE HOW TO TAKE IT
1585-131718-0027 I HAVE THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY
1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO ADDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD A FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING IN A CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTOR THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOWORK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE THE PARATHES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON OOCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMBERLESS OTHER DETAILS
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTE COMPANY LEASED AN O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOWROOMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS IS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS THE PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE
1585-131718-0033 THE EXPERIENCE WITH A LITTLE GAS ENGINEER WAS RATHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING AND RANT
1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEE HIVE DAY AND NIGHTS
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARDERNAACLET OF THE CLERK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM OVER IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGRURS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND OLD PAPER AND I COULD PUT EM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT
1585-131718-0040 IT THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
1585-131718-0041 WE DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO THE NO NOTICE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF THE KNIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMONEE
1585-131718-0044 YOU WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN
1585-131718-0045 ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN FOR TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHTS WITH HIS VIOLINS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIBRE
1585-131718-0048 I WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELL US DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAND FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE IS LEAVING
1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS ALLWING FIRST
1585-131718-0051 I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE FLOOD
1585-131718-0052 THEN THEY GOT THE PLEURACIAN HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF FACTING ADDISON'S EXPRESSIONS
1585-131718-0054 NOW THEN ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
1585-157660-0000 LONDON IS GAAT AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MEN ARE MOPEED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE EARL STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAMS STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UTTERED THE FOLLOWING ORRITORICAL FLIGHT
1585-157660-0003 GLORIOUS IN LONDON
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WON ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEAT IN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNING COUNCILES
1585-157660-0006 WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERING AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE ENFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHUUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THE SUNRISES IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXPECTATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPORTATION FOULTS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST HE PROMISES AND OFT HE HITS WHERE HOPE'S COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLITS
1585-157660-0009 YUSIS ONE DABBLE WHEN SIX IS TREBACOY
1585-157660-0010 WILLEM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CHENOPOD WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION
1585-157660-0011 THE POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE ME WORD FOR IT
1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON THE CASTE AND WILL WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE LIE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BU PAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS CAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD JUMPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCATED
1585-157660-0015 THE PREEN'S SHOP OF I WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVERN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES BURRIBRIDGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS PLOP MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE OR INEFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW OF THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AS THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEALS OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE VAST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS AS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO HIM
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY ACQUIRED A TRUE LOVE OF RELIGION
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT EPOCH OF THE SOUL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHABHADA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS SCATTERED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HAS HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ODOR WHICH PROVED ITS POLITICAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR POLITICAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 BY FIXING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GRIP OF AN INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE AND GROWTH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING CELLS INTO A PERMANENT PASSIVITY MAKING THEM CAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEIR OWN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MASTERING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING OUR STEPS FOR AGES COULD NOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING TO A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND OF FIGHTING IN FREEDOM'S CAUSE
1630-102884-0016 IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF INERTIA WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUTH AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY BOTH WITHIN HIS BOUNDARIES AND OUTSIDE
1630-141772-0000 ON THE PADZEN HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH A FLAGSTAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND CHILDLIKE MOAN
1630-141772-0001 SUDDENLY HE AGAIN FELT THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BURNING LACERATING PAIN IN HIS FEET
1630-141772-0002 WAS HIS FIRST THOUGHT I
1630-141772-0003 HE FEEBLY MOVED HIS LEG AND UTTERED A WEAK SICKLY GROAN WHICH AROUSED ITS OWN PITY
1630-141772-0004 LEAVE THIS YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TERRIBLE PAIN OF BEING LIFTED ON TO THE STRETCHER THE JOLTING WHILE BEING WEIGHED AND THE PROBING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0006 DURING THIS TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPEAK IT
1630-141772-0007 HE CALLED ON SEEING THE PRISONERS
1630-141772-0008 I COMMANDED AS SQUADRON REPLIED REPTNIN
1630-141772-0009 PRINCE REPNON NAMED LIEUTENANT SUCTILLON
1630-141772-0010 AFTER LOOKING AT HIM AND NAPOLEON SMILED
1630-141772-0011 YOUTH IS NO HINDRANCE TO COURAGE MUTTERED SUCCELLEN IN A FAILING VOICE
1630-141772-0012 BUT A SPLENDID REPLY SAID NAPOLEON
1630-141772-0013 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYES TO COMPLETE THE CAUSE OF PRISONERS COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHONE WITH SELF SATISFACTION AND THE PLEASURE
1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD ICORN PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER MOTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOUR THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY NOW HASTENED TO RETURN THE HOLY IMAGE
1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED BUT A LITTLE IKON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT UD BE TO KNOW WHERE TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND HER GRAVE
1630-141772-0018 HOW HAPPY AND CALM I SHOULD BE IF I COULD NOW SAY LORD HAVE MERCY ON YOU
1630-141772-0019 EITHER TO A POWER INDEFINABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHICH I NOT ONLY CANNOT ADDRESS BUT WHICH I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS IN WORDS THE GREAT ALL OR NOTHING SAID HE TO HIMSELF BUT TO THAT GOD WHO HAS BEEN SOWN INTO THIS AMULET BY MARY
1630-141772-0020 THAT STRETCHERS MOVED ON
1630-141772-0021 THE QUIET HOME LIFE AND PEACEFUL HAPPINESS OF BON HILLS PRESENTED ITSELF TO THEM
1630-141772-0022 AND HE IS A NERVOUS BILIOUS SUBJECT SAID LARRY AND WILL NOT RECOVER
1630-73710-0000 IT IS AT THE FOOT OF THE WOMAN THAT WE LAY THE LAURELS THAT WITHOUT HER SMILE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GAINED IT IS HER IMAGE THAT STRINGS THE LYRE OF THE POET THAT ANIMATES OUR VOICE IN THE BLAZE OF ELOQUENT FACTION AND GUIDES HER BRAIN IN THE AUGUST TOILS OF STATELY COUNCILS
1630-73710-0001 IS THERE NO HOPE FOR THEM SO FULL OF THE HOPE
1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE BUT TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO HIS IMAGINATION
1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCUR FLITS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OBSCURING ALL OUR GAY FANCIES WITH ITS BAT LIKE WING AND TASTING THE HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF HER HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPIRATIONS
1630-73710-0004 IN MINE OWN
1630-73710-0005 WAS DEAD WHAT COULD YOU DO
1630-73710-0006 I BET ABOUT MY CHAMBER LIKE A FILLY BIRD IN THE CAGE
1630-73710-0007 DO NOT THINK OF MOVING TO ANY
1630-73710-0008 DO NOT KEEP THE MESSAGES AN INSTANT
1630-73710-0009 KISS ON MY FOREHEAD
1630-73710-0010 AND WRITE ONLY ONE WORD TO YOUR OWN HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0011 FERDNANCE TO HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0012 GOD BLESS YOU MY HENRIETTA MY BELOVED MY MATCHLESS HENRIETA
1630-73710-0013 WHAT HAS IT SEPARATION NOT COST ME
1630-73710-0014 PANGS THAT HE COULD NOT CONCEIVE ANY HUMAN MISERY COULD OCCASION
1630-73710-0015 AND AND YET I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT HE WAS UNINJURED LAST NIGHT
1630-73710-0016 I I DARE NOT NOW OWN HOW FOOLISH I WAS
1630-73710-0017 I DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOUR HENRIETTA BUT I'M NERVOUS ABOUT CONCEALING OUR ENGAGEMENT FROM PAPA
1630-73710-0018 DAYS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE YOU CAN REACH BATH AND I KNOW FERDINAND I KNOW YOUR OFFICE IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU CAN CONFESS
1630-73710-0019 BUT COME BACK MY OWN AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND WRITE TO ME AT THE POST OFFICES AS YOU'RE SETTLED
1630-73710-0020 THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WE'RE SO NEAR MAKES ME RESTLESS
1630-73710-0021 I WAS TO MEET HIM WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS AS I CAN COMMAND
1630-96099-0000 THAT WAS SIR YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERTAKE
1630-96099-0001 THEN SOMETHING IS HAPPENED HE HAS SOME SPECIAL INFORMATION SOME GREAT NEWS
1630-96099-0002 WHERE BLOCH APPEARED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH HIM
1630-96099-0003 ON NOW JUST WHEN WE MOST WARNED HIM NEVER
1630-96099-0004 ETIATE TRIPLE ITIOT
1630-96099-0005 YOU SHALL BE DISMISSED DISCHARGED FROM THE TZAR YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE FALSE
1630-96099-0006 IT IS THAT O YO GREAT GLUTTONY
1630-96099-0007 MY GENTLEMAN MADE HIMSELF SUCH PLEASANT
1630-96099-0008 WELL AT ANY RATE FOR MY SINS I ACCEPTED YOU
1630-96099-0009 WE ENTERED THE FIRST RESTAURANT THAT OF THE REUNITED TRENTS YOU KNOW IT PERHAPS BECAUSE MONSIEUR
1630-96099-0010 I HAD NO FEAR OF HIM NOT TILL THE VERY LAST WHEN HE PLAYED ME THIS ABLE TURN
1630-96099-0011 I SUSPECTED NOTHING WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT HIS POCKETBOOK IT WAS STUFFED FULL MESSIEUR I SAW THAT AND MY CONFERENCE INCREASED CALL FOR THE RECKONING AND PAID WITH AN ITALIAN BANK NOTE
1630-96099-0012 YOU EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT PRAY
1630-96099-0013 HE WENT OUT MESSIA AND PIFF'P HE WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN
1630-96099-0014 WHY LET HIM OUT OF YER SIGHT
1630-96099-0015 IT WAS ONLY NOW AT THE LEONTH HOUR THAT THE ITALIAN HAD BECOME INCULPATED AND THE QUESTION OF HIS POSSIBLE ANXIETY TO ESCAPE HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED
1630-96099-0016 HE LEFT EVERYTHING BEHIND AND
1630-96099-0017 HAND IT TO ME SAID THE CHIEF AND WHEN IT CAME UPON HIS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES HURRIEDLY
1630-96099-0018 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR MORE THAN A WORD HERE AND THERE
1630-96099-0019 IT IS AS NO DOUBT ITALIAN
1630-96099-0020 OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WOULD NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD NOR OF MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE
1630-96099-0021 IT WAS A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED LIRA A HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS A
1630-96099-0022 HE WAS MUCH PRESSED IN HIS GREAT HURRY
1630-96099-0023 DIRECTLY HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED BY THE DEVIL
1630-96099-0024 HE WISHED TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT THEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CAB AND WERE DRIVING AWAY TOGETHER
1650-157641-0000 THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS SMOKING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER IS CURIOUS
1650-157641-0001 NOW MISSUS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IN A SMOKING HUMOR AND SHALL PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHTS
1650-157641-0002 BUT SEE WHERE WE ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU
1650-157641-0003 THE DWARF'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE CATHOLIC AND
1650-157641-0004 BUT QUILP AND BRASS WERE NOW IN SAFETY
1650-157641-0005 THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE OPANENTS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO
1650-157641-0006 ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THE GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATES SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR SMOKING UPON OFFICERS OF THE ARMY
1650-157641-0007 THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ADOUR OF TOBACCO AND THE DISTRESSED THE MAN WHO SMOKED
1650-157641-0008 HERE IS FISTUTO'S OR THACKERAY'S COMMENTS ON IT WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
1650-157641-0009 I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT THESE WOMEN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RIVAL
1650-157641-0010 I WOULD LAY A GUINEA BUT A MANLY LADY WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I'M A SMOKER AND SAYS OH THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE
1650-157641-0011 GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR TWO THREESCORE YEARS FRANCE SMOKES TO A MAN
1650-157641-0012 PSHAH LOOK ON HIS PROGRESS
1650-157641-0013 THUS THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS NOW BROUGHT INTO THIS DRAWING ROOM
1650-157641-0014 THE JOURNALISTS AND THE BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THE KOGERS WERE ABOUT WERE BELOW THE BIG TASTES OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS
1650-157641-0015 BOTH QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE PRINCE CONSLOR DETESTED IT SO TOBACCO WAS TABOO WHEREVER A COURT WAS
1650-167613-0000 THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT THE PRINCE ANDREWS APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA
1650-167613-0001 SEAS WERE BROUGHT IN AND THE SOUL WAS THIRTY TWO
1650-167613-0002 THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT THE PEER'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF THE MOUSICOTE AND THE POSITION OF OUR ARMY FROM WHICH HE HAD ARISEN
1650-167613-0003 SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS
1650-167613-0004 NOW BEING A MILITARY MAN I CAN'T SAY I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND A GENERAL POSITION
1650-167613-0005 WELL THEN YOU KNOW MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE BE IT WHO IT MAY SAID PRINCE GEORGE
1650-167613-0006 AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BARCLAY THE TOLLY
1650-167613-0007 PURE LOOKED AT MALCOLM WITH THE CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH HOWEVER INVOLUNTARILY ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER
1650-167613-0008 WE SEE LIGHT AGAIN SINCE HIS SERENITY HAS BEEN APPOINTED YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID MICHKING TIMIDLY AND CONTINUALLY TURNING TO GLANCE AT HIS COLONEL
1650-167613-0009 WHY SO ASK THY PEER
1650-167613-0010 THEN WHY HAS IT FORBIDDEN
1650-167613-0011 AT SMOLENSK TOO HE JUDGED CORRECTLY THAT THE FRENCH MIGHT OUTFLANK US AS THEY HAD A LARGE FORCE
1650-167613-0012 HE ORDERED US TO RETREAT AND ALL OUR EFFORTS AND ALLOWANCES WENT INTO NOTHING
1650-167613-0013 SOWED THE ASPENS WITH BARCLEY
1650-167613-0014 WELL RUSSIAN WAS WELL A FOREIGNER COULD SERVE HER AND BE A SPLENDID MINISTER BUT AS SOON AS SHE IS IN DANGER SHE NEEDS ONE OF HER OWN KEN
1650-167613-0015 AND THEY SAY HE IS A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REJOINED THAT PEER
1650-167613-0016 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS MEANT BY A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW IRONICALLY
1650-167613-0017 A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED THE PEERS
1650-167613-0018 PURE I LOOK AT HIM IN SURPRISE
1650-167613-0019 AND YET THEY SAY THAT THE WAR IS LIKE A GAME OF CHESSS HE REMARKED
1650-167613-0020 THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE BODIES OF TROOP CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO ANYONE
1650-167613-0021 SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ON MEASURES AND THE LEAST OF ALL ON POSITION BUT ON WHAT THEN
1650-167613-0022 AND THE FEELING THAT IT IS IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMALKIN AND HE IS SOLDIER
1650-167613-0023 THE MATTER IS WON BY THOSE WHO FIRMLY RESOLVE TO WIN IT
1650-167613-0024 WHY DID WE LOSE THE BATTLE OF THE OUSBULLERS
1650-167613-0025 WE'VE LOUSED SO LET US RUN AND WE WILL RUN
1650-167613-0026 BUT TO MORROW WE SHANN'T SAY IT
1650-167613-0027 BUT NOW WHAT A WEIGHT HAS TO MORROW
1650-167613-0028 THE FACT IS THAT THOSE MEN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE RIDDEN AROUND THE POSITION NOT ONLY TO NOW HELP MATTERS BUT IT HINDER
1650-167613-0029 THAT'S THE TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH SAID MERKIN
1650-167613-0030 IT IS NOW THE DAY FOR THAT THEY SAID
1650-167613-0031 HAU WERE SALANT THE OFFICERS ROSE
1650-167613-0032 YES YES ANSWER THE PRINCE ANDREW ABSENT
1650-167613-0033 THE FRENCH HAS DESTROYED MY HOME AND OUR ONLY WAY TO DESTROY MARSICO THEY HAVE OUTRAGED AND ARE OUTRAGING ME EVERY MOMENT THE ARE MY ENEMIES
1650-167613-0034 IN MY OPINION THEY ARE ALL CRITICS
1650-167613-0035 AND SO THINKS TIMALAKI AND THE WHOLE ARMY
1650-167613-0036 SINCE THEY ARE MY FOES THEY CANNOT BE MY FRIENDS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SAID IN A TUSIT
1650-167613-0037 YES YES MUTTERED PETER LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES AT THAT PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0038 THEY TALK TO US OF RULES OF WAR OF CHIVALRY OF FACTS OF TRUTHS OF MERCY TO THE UNFORTUNATE AND SO ON IT IS OUR RUBBISH
1650-167613-0039 THE PLUNDER OF OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES ISHUFUST PAPER MONEY AND WORST OF ALL THEY KILL MY CHILDREN AND MY FATHER AND THEN TALK OF RULES OF WAR AND MAGNANIMITY TO FOALS
1650-167613-0040 TAKE NO PRISONERS BY THE KIEL AND BE KILLED
1650-167613-0041 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD FELT IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER OR NOT MASSACA WAS TAKEN AS MALIN'SK HAD BEEN WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED IN HIS SPEECH BY AN UNEXPECTED CRAMMY HIS THROAT
1650-167613-0042 HE PACED UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES IN SILENCE OR HIS EYES GLITTERED FEVERISHLY AND HIS LIPS QUIVERED AS HE BEGAN SPEAKING
1650-167613-0043 BUT WHEN THERE WAS A WAR LIKE THIS ONE IT WOULD BE A WAR
1650-167613-0044 WHAT IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESS IN THE WARFARE
1650-167613-0045 AND IN SPITE OF ALL THIS IT IS THE HIGHEST CLASS RESPECTED TO EVERY ONE
1650-167613-0046 HOW DOES JOB ABOVE LOOK AT THEM AND HEAR THEM
1650-167613-0047 I SEE THAT I I HAVE BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND TOO MUCH
1650-167613-0048 AND IT DOESN'T DO FOR THEM TO TASTE OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL AH WELL IT IS NOW FOR LONG HE ADDED
1650-167613-0049 HOWEVER YOU'RE SLEEPY AND IT'S FINE FOR ME TO SLEEP
1650-167613-0050 WE GO BACK TO GORKY SAID PRINCE ANDREW SUDDENLY
1650-167613-0051 GO GO BUT BEFORE A BATTLE ONE MUST HAVE ONE'S SLEEP OUT REPEATED PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0052 NO NOW HE DOES NOT WANT IT PIERRE CONCLUDED
1650-167613-0053 AS I KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING
1650-167613-0054 ONE PICTURE SUCCEEDED ANOTHER ANOTHER IN HIS IMAGINATION
1650-167613-0055 ON ONE OF THEM HE HAD DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY
1650-173551-0000 HIS MAJORDOMO CAME IN A SECOND TIME TO SAY THAT THE FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THE LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND THAT SOME ONE FROM BEZZETEV'S WINDOW HAD A COW TO ASK PIERRE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOK AS SHE HERSELF WAS LEAVING FOR THE COUNTRY
1650-173551-0001 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE VILLAGE
1650-173551-0002 THE HALED PORTER WAS STANDING AT THE FRONT DOOR
1650-173551-0003 UPON THE LANDING WHERE PIERRE STOOD THERE WAS A SECOND STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE BACK ENTRANCE
1650-173551-0004 HE WENT DOWN THAT STAIRCASE AND OUT INTO THE YARD NO ONE HAVING SEEN HIM
1650-173551-0005 WHEN HE FELT THAT HE WAS BEING LOOKED AT HE BEHAVED LIKE AN OSTERBRIDGE WHICH HIDE HIS HEAD IN THE BUSH IN ORDER NOW TO BE SEEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND QUICKENING HIS FACE WENT DOWN THE STREET
1650-173551-0006 HE HIRED THE FIRST A CAB HE MET AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE PATRIARCH'S POUNCE WHERE THE WIDOW BADSITIVES HOUSE WAS
1650-173551-0007 THIS WAS THE AUTHENTIC SCOUT ACTS WITH PATHIVE'S NOTES AND EXCLAMATIONS
1650-173551-0008 HE SAT DOWN AT THE DUSTY WRITING TABLE AND HAVING LAID THE MANUSCRIPT BEFORE HIM OPENED THEM OUT CLOSED THEM AND FINALLY PUSHED THEM AWAY AND RESTING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND SANK INTO MEDICATION
1650-173551-0009 MAKRY ALEXROVITCH CAME TWICE THAT EVENING SHUFFLING ALONG IN HIS SLASHES AS FAR AS THE DOOR AND STOPPED AND LOOKED INGRATIATEDLY AT PIERRE
1650-173552-0000 AT THAT VERY TIME AT TEN IN THE MORNING OF THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER NAPOLEON WAS STANDING AMONG HIS TROOPS ON THE CYCLONIC HEEL LOOKING AT THE PANORAMAS SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM
1650-173552-0001 OF THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE MORNING WAS MAGICAL
1650-173552-0002 BUT MY CLEMENCY IS ALWAYS READY TO DESCEND UPON MY VANQUISHED
1650-173552-0003 YET HERE SHE IS LYING AT MY FEET WITH HER GOLDEN DOMES AND CROUSSES CINGULLATING IN A TWINKLING IN THE SUNSHINE
1650-173552-0004 BUT BUT I SHALL SPARE HER
1650-173552-0005 FROM THE HIDE OF THE KREMELIN YES THE HERE IS THE KREMELIN YES I WILL GIVE THEM JUST A LOUSE I WILL TEACH THEM THE MEANING OF TRUE CIVILISATION I WILL MAKE GENERATIONS OF BOYARS REMEMBER THEIR CONQUEROR WITH LOVE
1650-173552-0006 I WILL TELL THE DEPUTATION THAT I DENOUNCE AND DO NOT DESIRE WAR THAT I'D WAGE THE WAR ONLY AGAINST THE FALSE POLICY OF THEIR COURT THAT I LOVE AND RESPECT ALEXANDER AND THAT IN MASSACRE I WILL ACCEPT TERMS OF PEACE WORTHY OF MYSELF AND OF MY PEOPLE
1650-173552-0007 I DO NOT WISH TO UTILIZE THE FORTUNES OF WAR TO HUMILIATE AND HONOR THIS MONARCH
1650-173552-0008 HE WOULD HAVE TO BE TOLD ALL THE SAME SAYS SOME GENTLEMAN OF THAT SUITE BUT GENTLEMEN
1650-173552-0009 A SINGLE REPORT OF THE SINGENING GUN FOLLOWED AND THE TROOPS WHO WERE ALREADY SPREAD OUT ON DIFFERENT SIDES SOUTH MOSCOW MOVED INTO THE CITY THROUGH VORD KALOUGA AND DARGOMALEVKA
1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER FOR WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED A MAJESTIC TEACHER OF MORALS AND RELIGIOUS WISDOM
1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH HE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH HE KNEW WHO HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO USE IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN AT NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED ITS TASTE
1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMBLED TOGETHER IN AS AWED A MANNER AS HE MIGHT IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE EFFECT
1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS JOHNSON'S ABBREVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD IS MARKED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT
1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF BAD HABITS NEGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE THE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED BY TIME
1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENCE OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING AS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECTS NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
1651-136854-0009 YOUTH AMBITIOUS AS TO THINKING HONORS EASY TO BE HAD
1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KINDS OF DISEASES PURSUED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCIKIN MANHOOD
1651-136854-0012 THEY
1651-136854-0013 SCHOLAR'S FRIENDSHIP LIKE HER LADIES
1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO MAN BY WORDS WORDS REPELLED BY PASSIONS
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY RETURN IT
1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY HINDERS COMPLAISANCE
1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCES INSOLENCE AND ENVYING
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD IN EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST' TOO LITTLE
1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH THE SUPERIORS EVERY ONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN MISTRESS
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED SCARCE EVER WERE WITHOUT CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IF TWO TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MANY AGAINST FIVE
1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO WRONG IN THE OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND GET A MORE READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GUARD AND DECIDE AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
1651-136854-0026 THIS MY MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN USEFUL WISE AND INNOCENT AND A DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND WHOLLY
1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENIES YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HATH CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEFS SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 NUMBER THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANT OF STOICISM AS THE SUN OF CIVILIZATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENTENCES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRATES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF ROMAN LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABBLER TO ANOTHER WE HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT IN A LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTERWOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES DIFFER AS PLAIN CLOTHING AND BROCADE
1686-142278-0000 THAT HE WAS GONE
1686-142278-0001 NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES ARE CRIMSON AND ANER TINTS
1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY SKETCHING CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK INTO THE GARDEN
1686-142278-0003 HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF ITS BRIEF SUCCESS AND ALL THE SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE A CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECTS OF HIS DESIRES OH DEAR
1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THAT WORLD OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER
1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD THE RESPONSES ONLY TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0006 SHE FORGOT THAT HE HAD NOW MADE THEM AN OFFER
1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK BUT RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING BEDTIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN
1686-142278-0008 OH
1686-142278-0009 I WANTS TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0010 VERY SERIOUS TO US ALSO
1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER ABOUT HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT NOTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DO NOT ANSWER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
1686-142278-0014 MARGUERITE COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0015 BUT WHY YOUR DEAR PAPA DO TELL ME
1686-142278-0016 PERHAPS I MUST NO LONGER BE A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
1686-142278-0017 BUT NOTHING TO THE SHOCK YOU RECEIVED FROM MISTER HALE'S LAST SPEECH WHAT COULD HE MEAN
1686-142278-0018 IT WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR BEING TOO MYSTERIOUS
1686-142278-0019 WHY CAN YOU NO LONGER BE THAT CLERGYMAN
1686-142278-0020 SURELY IF THE BISHOP WERE TOLD ALL WE KNOW ABOUT FREDERICK AND THE HARD AND UNJUST
1686-142278-0021 MARGARET I' WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
1686-142278-0022 I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS WAY BUT AFTER TO NIGHT LET US NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN
1686-142278-0023 I CAN METE THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY PAINFUL MISERABLE DOUBTS BUT IT IS THE EFFORT BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING
1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION AND NOT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THAT HE PAUSED
1686-142278-0025 MARGARET SIGHED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEAR HORROR
1686-142278-0026 MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE HOLY CHURCH TO WHICH I AM TO BE SHUT OUT
1686-142278-0027 HE COULD NOW GO ON FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
1686-142278-0028 MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WERE ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETTEAN
1686-142278-0029 THE ONE STRAYED FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING
1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAS OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE CAUSE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW INVOLVED
1686-142278-0031 LISTEN DEAR MARGARET SAID HE PUTTING ONE ARM ROUND HER
1686-142278-0032 WHAT GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND YET HE WILL IN ANOTHER
1686-142278-0033 IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT OR AN ORDER TO A CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY
1686-142278-0034 AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE WHICH HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE GAZED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING
1686-142278-0035 I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACH THAT WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY OTHER MIND LESS TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE
1686-142278-0036 SHE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE WENT ON
1686-142278-0037 MARGARET I TRIED TO DO IT I TRIED TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THE ADDITIONAL PREFERMENTS AND STOPPING QUIETLY HERE STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
1686-142278-0038 IT GOD FORGIVE ME
1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING LOW WORDS OF SELF REPROACH AND HUMILIATION ON WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT A FEW
1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD SAID BURTHEN WE MUST LEAVE HELLSTONE
1686-142278-0041 LIFE
1686-142278-0042 I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP I DARESAY I HAVE TOLD YOU SO BUT I FORGET THINGS JUST NOW SAID MISTER HALE COLLAPSING INTO HIS DEPRESSED MANNER AS SOON AS HE CAME TO TALK OF HER HARD MATTER OF FACT DETAILS INFORMING HIM OF MY INTENTION TO RESIGN THIS VICARAGE
1686-142278-0043 THEY ARE BUT WHAT I HAD TRIED UPON MYSELF WITHOUT A WAIL
1686-142278-0044 THAT WILL BE A TRIAL BUT WORSE FAR WORSE WILL BE THAT PARTING FROM MY DEAR PEOPLE
1686-142278-0045 HE WILL COME TO STAY WITH US NOW
1686-142278-0046 WAS IT TO BE SO SUDDEN BUT
1686-142278-0047 OH WHAT DOES MAMMA SAY

1686-142278-0050 PERHAPS AFTER ALL SHE MAY NOT OH DEAR
1686-142278-0051 SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED AS THE FORCE OF THE BLOW RETURNED UPON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALIZE HOW ANOTHER WOULD MAKE IT
1686-142278-0052 TO MILTON NORTHERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DULL INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENNESS OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER HEART
1686-142278-0053 MILTON NORTHERN OR
1686-142278-0054 YES SAID HE IN THE SAME DESPONDENT INDIFFERENT WAY AND
1686-142278-0055 BUT HE WITH HIS QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ IN HER FACES AS IN A MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNED IT OFF WITH AN EFFORT
1686-142278-0056 YOU SHALL BE TOLD AT ALL MARGARET
1686-142278-0057 ONLY HELP ME TO TELL YOUR MASTER
1686-142278-0058 I AM GOING OUT FOR THE DAY TO BUY FATHER DOBSON AND THE POOR PEOPLE ON BRACY COMMON GOOD BYE

1686-142278-0060 ROBERT DID DISLIKE IT DID SHRINK FROM IT MORE THAN FROM ANYTHING SHE HAD EVER HAD TO DO IN HER LIFE BEFORE
1686-142278-0061 BUT MISTER HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDINGLY HE PRESSED HER HAND IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
1686-142278-0062 MARGARET WAS NEARLY UPSET AGAIN AFTER A BURST OF CRYING
1686-142278-0063 TO TURN HER THOUGHTS SHE SAID AND NOW TELL ME PAPA WHAT OUR PLANS ARE

1686-142278-0071 I HAVE CANNOT STAND OBJECTIONS
1686-142278-0072 THEY MAKE ME SO VERY UNDECIDED

1686-142278-0077 A PRIVATE TUTOR HE
1686-142278-0078 SAID MARGARET LOOKING SCORNFUL WHAT IN THAT WORLD DO MANUFACTURES WANT WITH THE CLASSICS OR LITERATURE OR THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A GENTLEMAN

1701-141760-0026 WHY HAVE YOU THROWN THAT AWAY ASKED BARRIS
1701-141760-0027 IT IS SOME LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT THE DEVIL DO I WANT IT TO
1701-141760-0028 HE LOOKS INTENTLY AND INQUIRINGLY INTO HIS FRIEND'S EYES EVIDENTLY TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND THE ANSWER TO SOME QUESTION
1701-141760-0029 WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT COUNT I WAS NOT AT ALL ALARMED WHETHER I KNEW I WAS RIGHT
1701-141760-0030 I CAME FORWARD BERG STOOD UP AND SHOWED HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR A FACE TO EXPRESS GREATER RESPECT OR SELF COMPLACENCY THAN HIS DID
1701-141760-0031 WELL HE STORMED AT ME AS THE SAYING IS STORMED AND STORMED AND SCORNED
1701-141760-0032 IT IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF LIFE BUT RATHER OF DEATH AS THE SAYING IS
1701-141760-0033 ALBANIANS AND THE DEVILS AND TO SIBERIA SAID BERG WITH A SAGACIOUS SMILE
1701-141760-0034 STILL I REMAINED SILENT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK KIND
1701-141760-0035 THE NEXT DAY IT WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ORDERS OF THE STATE
1701-141760-0036 THAT'S THE WAYE ACCOUNT SAID BERG LIGHTING HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE
1701-141760-0037 YES THAT WAS FINE SAID PROSTOV SMILING
1701-141760-0038 ROSTOV WAS A TRUTHFUL YOUNG MAN AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT HAVE TOLD A DIFFICULT LIE
1701-141760-0039 HE BEGAN HIS STORY MEANING TO TELL ME EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAPPENED BUT IMPERCEPTIBLY INVOLUNTARILY AND INEVITABLY HE LAPSED INTO FALSEHOOD
1701-141760-0040 PRINCE ANDREW WHO LIKED TO HELP YOUNG MEN WAS FLATTERED BY BEING ASKED TO HIS ASSISTANCE AND BEING WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS BORIS WHO HAD MANAGED TO PLEASE HIM THE DAY BEFORE HE WISHED TO DO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WANTED
1701-141760-0041 IN SPITE OF PRINCE ANDREW'S DISAGREEABLE IRONICAL TONE IN SPITE OF THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH ROSTOV FROM HIS FIGHTING PARTY POINT OF VIEW REGARDED ALL THESE LITTLE ADJUTANTS ON THE STAFF OF WHOM THE NEW COMER WAS EVIDENTLY ONE ROSTOV FELT CONFUSED BLUSHED AND BECAME SILENT
1701-141760-0042 BORIS ENQUIRED WHAT NEWS THERE MIGHT BE OF THE STAFF AND WHAT WITHOUT INDISCRETION ONE MIGHT ASK ABOUT OUR PLANS
1701-141760-0043 WE SHALL PROBABLY STAND REPLIED BOLKOVSKI EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO SAY MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER
1701-141760-0044 BERG TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WITH GREAT POLITENESS WHETHER AS WAS RUMORED THE ALLOWANCE OF FORAGE MONEY TO THE CAPTAINS OF COMPANIES WOULD BE DOUBLED
1701-141760-0045 I WAS THERE SAID ROSTOV ANGRILY AS IF INTENDING TO INSULT THAT AIDE DE CAMP
1701-141760-0046 WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HE SAID YES THERE ARE MANY STORIES NOW TOLD ABOUT THAT FIRE
1701-141760-0047 BUT OUR STORIES ARE THE STORIES OF WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER THE ENEMY'S FIRE
1701-141760-0048 OUR STORIES HAVE ONE WEIGHT NOT LIKE THE STORIES OF THOSE FELLOWS ON THE STAFF WHO GET REWARDS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
1701-141760-0049 HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME BUT DON'T FORGET THAT I DO NOT REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED OR AS A MAN OLDER THAN YOU MY ADVICE IS TO LET THE MATTER DROP
1701-141760-0050 EXCLAIMED PRINCE ANDREW AND WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH WENT OUT
1701-141760-0051 AND HE WAS STILL MORE ANGRY AT HAVING OMITTED TO FIND IT
1701-141760-0052 HE ORDERED HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND COLDLY TAKING LEAVE OF BERIS RODE HOME
1701-141760-0053 SHOULD HE GO TO HEADQUARTERS NEXT DAY AND CHALLENGE THAT AFFECTED ADJUTANT OR REALLY LET THE MATTER DROP WAS THE QUESTION THAT WORRIED HIM ALL THE DAY
2506-11267-0000 ICY SHORES OF THEM DEPART NOT PERHAPS WITHOUT AN INNATE LONGING TOO TO QUIT THEIR ISLAND ALONG WITH THOSE HAPPY SNOBS

2506-11267-0005 MY LADY MARCHIONESS COMES ON BOARD LOOKS ROUND WITH THAT HAPPY AIR OF MINGLED TERROR AND IMPERTINENCE WHICH DISTINGUISHES HER LADYSHIPS AND RUSHES TO HER CARRIAGE FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD MINGLE WITH THE OTHER SNOBS ON DECK

3660-172182-0020 AND BEING YOUNG HE CHANGED HIMSELF AND GREW TO HATE THE SIN THAT SEEMED SO LIKE HIS OWN THE MODRED ATHA'S NEPHEW AND FELL AT LAST IN THE GREAT BATTLE FIGHTING FOR THE KING
3660-172182-0021 AND WHEN DURAND CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE GUENEVER WAS HE SALUTED HIM

3660-172182-0027 AND A YEAR AND A SECOND AND A THIRD HE PROCEEDED THIS UNTIL HIS FAME HAD FLOWN OVER THE FACE OF THE KINGDOM
3660-172182-0028 AND HE GREETS THEE WELL AS AN UNCLE SHOULD GREET HIS NEPHEW AND AS AN VASSAL SHOULD GREET HIS LORD
3660-172182-0029 AND THE NEIGHBORING CHIEFS KNOWING THIS GROW INSOLENT TOWARD HIM AND COVERT HIS LAND AND POSITIONS
3660-172182-0030 AND ARTHUR TOLD DURRANT THE CAUSE OF THE MISSION AND OF THE COMING OF THE AMBASSADORS TO HIM OUT OF CORNWALL TRULY SAID DURRANT BE IT TO HIS ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE LORD I WILL DO ACCORDING TO THY WILL CONCERNING THIS EMBASSY

3660-172182-0035 AND EVERY WOMAN ASKED THAT WHICH HE DESIRED
3660-172182-0036 AND THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GIVING SO EAGER WAS EACH ONE TO BESTOW GIFTS AND OF THOSE WHO CAME TO ASK GIFTS NONE DEPARTED UNSATISFIED
3660-172182-0037 THEN URRAINE SENT EMBASSES TO THE MEN OF CORNWALL TO ASK THEM MISS
3660-172182-0038 AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WOULD BE THE FULNESS OF JOY AND HONOUR TO THEM FOR DURAIN TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR HOMAGE
3660-172182-0039 SO HE RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF SUCH AS WERE IN

3660-172183-0010 AND HE DESIRED ENID TO MOUNT HER HORSE AND TO RIDE FORWARD AND TO KEEP A LONG WAY BEHIND HIM
3660-172183-0011 AND AND UNLESS I SPEAK UNTO THEE SAY NOT THOU ONE WORD EITHER
3660-172183-0012 AND THOUGH THOU SHOULDST DESIRE TO SEE MY DEFEAT AND MY DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THOSE MEN YET DO I FEEL NO DREAM

3660-172183-0019 AND THEY LEFT THE WOOD AND THEY CAME TO AN OPEN COUNTRY WITH MEADOWS ON ONE HAND AND MOLLS MOWING THE MEADOWS

3660-172183-0025 I WILL DO LORD SAID SHE AS THOU SAYST
3660-172183-0026 AND AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRANK JEWRAINE WENT TO SLEEP AND SO DID ENID ALSO
3660-6517-0000 THAT DATES SEEM UNIMPORTANT BUT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE SHIP HAVE BEEN UNREMITTINGLY BUSY
3660-6517-0001 BOWERS ATTACKED THE SHIP'S STORES SURVEYED REITSTED AND RESTOWED THEM SAVING VERY MUCH SPACE BY UNSTOWING NUMEROUS CASES AND STOWING THE CONTENTS IN THE LAZARETTE
3660-6517-0002 WITHOUT STEAM THE LEAK CAN NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH THE HANDPUP BY TWO DAILY EFFORTS OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES
3660-6517-0003 AS THE SHIP WAS AND IN HER PRESENT HEAVILY LADEN CONDITION IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE OR FOUR HOURS A DAY
3660-6517-0004 THE LARGE GREEN TENT WAS PUT UP AND PROPER SUPPORTS MADE OF IT
3660-6517-0005 THE ENGINE ROOM STAFF AND ANDERSEN'S PEOPLE IN THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOWING THEIR LABORATORIES THE COOK REFITTING HIS GALLEY AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD ITS BAND OF WORKERS
3660-6517-0006 THE MAN'S SPACE SUCH AS IT IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FORE HATCH TO THE STEM UPON THE MAIN DECK
3660-6517-0007 UNDER THE FORECASTLE ARE STALLS OF FIFTEEN PONIES THE MAXIMUM THE SPACE WOULD HOLD A NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT IS PACKED TIGHT WITH FODDER
3660-6517-0008 IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FORECASTLE BULKADE IS A SMALL BOOBY HATCH THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE MEN'S MESS DESK IN BAD WEATHER
3660-6517-0009 ABAFT THE FORE HATCH IS THE OFFICE HOUSE
3660-6517-0010 WE MANAGED TO GET THREE TONS OF ICE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO COCASES OF MUTTON AND THREE COUCASES OF BEEF BESIDES SOME BOXES OF SWEETBREADS AND KIDNEYS INTO THE SPACE
3660-6517-0011 THE SACKS CONTAINING THIS LAST ADDED TO THE GOODS ALREADY MENTIONED MAKE A REALLY HEAVY DECK CAGOT AND ONE IS NATURALLY ANXIOUS CONCERNING IT BUT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY LASHING AND SECURING HAS BEEN DONE
3660-6517-0012 FORAGE I ORIGINALLY ORDERED TWENTY TONS OF COMPRESSED OAT AND HAY FROM MELBOURNE
3660-6517-0013 THE SCENE IS WHOLLY ENCHANTING AND SUCH A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER OR A GARDEN WHICH BLAZES WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION WITH ALL THINGS
3660-6517-0014 A GREAT MASSE OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED
3660-6517-0015 KAY AND I LUNCH WITH A PARTY IN THE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY'S SHIP REPAHOO
3660-6517-0016 TELEGRAM TO SAY TERRANOMA HAD ARRIVED SUNDAY NIGHT
3660-6517-0017 A THIRD SLEDGE STANDS ACROSS THE BREAK OF THE POOP IN THE SPACE HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY THE AFTERTWINCH
3660-6517-0018 THE QUANTITY IS TWO AND A HALF TONS AND THE SPACE OCCUPIED BUT CONSIDERABLE
3660-6517-0019 THE HEAD WAS OVER TWO FEET BY THE STERN BUT THIS WILL SOON BE REMEDIED
3660-6517-0020 THEY MUST PERFORCE BE CHAINED UP AND THEY ARE GIVEN WHAT SHELTER IS ACCORDED ON DECK BUT THEIR POSITION IS NOT ENVIABLE
3660-6517-0021 IT WAS A PATHETIC ATTITUDE DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY OCCASIONALLY SOME POOR BEASTS EMITS A LONG PATHETIC WHINE
3660-6517-0022 THERE ARE GENERALLY ONE OR TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASES MATTER BUT IT IS A SQUASH
3660-6517-0023 LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND HAS VEERED TO THE WESTWARD HEADING HER SLIGHTLY
3660-6517-0024 OATES AND ATKINSON WITH INTERMITTENT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHERS WERE BUSY KEEPING THE PONIES FROM THEIR LEGS
3660-6517-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EVIL AND NEARLY ALL HANDS WERE LABOURING FOR HOURS IN THE WEIGHTS OF THE SHIP HEAVING COAL SACKS OVERBOARD AND RELASHING THE PETROL CASES ET CETERA IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
3660-6517-0026 NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED THAN SOME EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY WAVE WOULD TEAR AWAY THE LASHING AND THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE ALL OVER
3660-6517-0027 FROM THIS MOMENT ABOUT FOUR A M THE ENGINE ROOM BECOME THE CENTRE OF INTEREST
3660-6517-0028 OF THE WATER GAINED IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT
3660-6517-0029 THE OUTLOOK APPEARED GRIM
3660-6517-0030 THE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH WAS BEING MADE WITH THE BOAT SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS MOST UNCERTAIN
3660-6517-0031 WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW UP FIRES WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
3660-6517-0032 THE SILAGE PUMP IS DEPENDENT ON THE MAIN ENGINE
3660-6517-0033 ON ONE OCCASION I WAS WAIST DEEP WHEN STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THE PO
3660-6517-0034 THE AFTERGUARD WERE ORGANIZED IN TWO PARTIES BY EVANS TO WORK BUCKETS THE MEN WERE KEPT STEADILY GOING ON THE CHOKED HAND PUMPS THIS SEEMED ALL THAT COULD BE DONE FOR THE MOMENT AND WHAT A MEASURE TO COUNT AS THE SOLE SAFEGUARD OF THE SHIPS FROM SINKING PRACTICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BAIL HER OUT
3660-6517-0035 OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD BEAR SOME OF THEM AWAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED BY HIS CHAIN
3663-172005-0000 THE FAWN HAD TAKEN HIS MORNING MEAL AND NOW LAY CURLED UP ON HIS BED OF MOSS
3663-172005-0001 WHENEVER THE FAWN CAUGHT UP HE WAS QUITE CONTENT TO FRISK
3663-172005-0002 THE DANGER WAS CERTAIN NOW I WAS NEAR
3663-172005-0003 THE HOUNDS HAD STRUCK A TRAIL WHERE SHE TURNED AND THE FAWN WAS SAVED
3663-172005-0004 ONE WAS ROWING THE OTHER HAD A GUN IN HIS HAND WHAT MUST SHE DO
3663-172005-0005 HER TIRED LEGS COULD NOT PROPEL THE TIRED BODY RAPID
3663-172005-0006 THE DOE SAW THE BEAST NEARING HER
3663-172005-0007 IN A MOMENT MORE THE BOAT WAS ON HER AND THE MEN AT THE OARS HAD LEANED OVER AND CAUGHT HIM
3663-172528-0000 I WAS NOT TORMENTED BY THIRST BUT HAD ABSTAINED FROM DRINKING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS
3663-172528-0001 THAT OLD MAN CEASED TO GIVE SO MUCH ANNOYANCE YET SUDDENLY HE APPEARED TO ME IN DREAMS
3663-172528-0002 FELICIA GIVEN SOME ORDERS NOT TO SPEAK TO ME OF THIS
3663-172528-0003 THIS MAID HAD STOLEN FROM ME CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND OF HER FEAR OF BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD DIED
3663-172528-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE ALLOWED ME TWICE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FULL I THEN COVERED MYSELF UP AND BEGAN TO SWEAT AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
3663-172528-0005 THEY SAY THAT MY POOR FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO GRIEVED WAS HE TO HEAR ALL THIS
3663-172528-0006 AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY STATE AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE SERVING GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT SHOUTING OUT AH TRAITRESS YOU HAVE KILLED HER FOR ME THEN
3663-172528-0007 SHE MAY INDEED HAVE SAVED MY LIFE SO LEND ME A HELPING HAND FOR I HAVE SWEATED AND BE QUICK FOR IT
3663-172528-0008 FELICIA RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS DRIED AND MADE ME COMFORTABLE AND I BEING CONSCIOUS OF A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN THE STATE BEGAN TO RECKON ON RECOVERY
3663-172528-0009 JUST THEN THE OTHER DOCTOR BERNARDINO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCES WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAD REFUSED TO BLEED ME
3663-172528-0010 MAESTRO FRANCESCO THAT THE MOST ABLE MAN EXCLAIMED OH POWER OF NATURE
3663-172528-0011 SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE OFFICIALS KNOW NOTHING
3663-172528-0012 THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER SAYING IF HE HAD DRUNK IN ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED UPON THE SPOT
3663-172528-0013 AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK ANY WATER
3663-172528-0014 I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD BEEN ENTIRELY QUENCHED MY THIRST
3663-172528-0015 IN A LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THAT POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED YOU TO BLEED HIM
3663-172528-0016 IF SHE KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE
3663-172528-0017 YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HIS CURED
3663-172528-0018 AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED UP HIS FACE AGAIN
3663-172528-0019 THE VERY MORNING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD
3663-172528-0020 DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME IN ANOTHER DISORDER NOW YOU WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM
3663-172528-0021 THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO TO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE
3663-172528-0022 SO I MADE MY MIND UP AND PREPARED TO SLEEP
3663-172528-0023 THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIERRE LANDER WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
3663-172528-0024 NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUSTO WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
3663-172528-0025 I HAD HARBORED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR THIS MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS
3663-172528-0026 MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DA MONTEVERSKI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL
3663-172528-0027 THERE THEY SCATTERED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY
3663-172528-0028 MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WELL SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE
3663-172528-0029 AT THESE WORDS MAESTRO GASTINO THE DUKE'S TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT
3663-172528-0030 GEORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MYASTHRO AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED THERE IS THE MAN WHO ACCUSES YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NOT
3663-172528-0031 AS FIERCELY AS I COULD NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED THE GIORGIO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0032 HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO OR THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THE SORT
3663-172528-0033 MAESTRO AUGUSTINO RETORTED YOU GALLOWS BIRD I
3663-172528-0034 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT FOR SUCH CERTAIN
3663-172528-0035 GEORGIO MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT APPROVED ME
3663-172528-0036 THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE KING CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND HE HALTED
3663-172528-0037 THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MARVELLED I WAS STILL ALIVE AFTERWARDS HE BADE ME TO TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH
3663-172528-0038 WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTE A GUTTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO IS ABLE TO DESTROY ME
3663-172528-0039 I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND HAD TOLD HIM ALL THE AFFAIR ABOUT THE MINT
3663-172528-0040 HE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL HAVE YOUR VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT
3663-172528-0041 I THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIETRO PAGOLO ADVICE ABOUT STAMPING THE COINS AND THEN WENT OFF UPON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE KING OR ANYBODY ELSE
3663-172528-0042 DO YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALISE THAT FEROCIOUS TYRANT
3663-172528-0043 YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS
3663-172528-0044 IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUC ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENT
3663-172528-0045 MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL THE SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DYES FOR THAT MEDAL
3663-172528-0046 I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIM MORE
3663-172528-0047 I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENCINA THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL
3663-172528-0048 NICCOLO DA MONTERE GUTTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT SAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENCINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
3663-172528-0049 NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE JEW FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
3663-172528-0050 I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A ROSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY
3663-172528-0051 THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS THE FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED
3663-172528-0052 I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT A VERY SHORT RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL
3663-172528-0053 I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING IT
3663-172528-0054 I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR TO ROME
3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE AND
3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO I BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE
3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADES THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF KENNA
3915-57461-0003 HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FERRY BOATS THAT STARTS AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED
3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT COMING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM
3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RONON FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
3915-57461-0006 NOW ALAS TO THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE
3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED HIM TRIED TO COMFORT HIM
3915-57461-0008 THEN THE ROANE SAID TO THE BOATMAN
3915-57461-0009 WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER BROTHERS
3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONUM HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONEN OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO
3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVORING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF EVERYTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD
3915-57461-0013 SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET THAT HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF
3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARMS AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF ITS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR
3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TOKOBAY FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING O MISERABLE MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME
3915-57461-0016 NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A SHORT WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET
3915-57461-0017 AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY COVERING ALL OVER
3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO AT THE KEHUANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT
3915-57461-0019 HAPLY CONTINUED THE PRIESTS I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART
3915-57461-0020 ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF HER MARVELLOUS AILMENT
3915-57461-0021 THINKING I COULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I IS NOT MISTAKEN
3915-57461-0022 AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOMES ME TO BEAR MALICE
3915-57461-0023 REPENT THEREFORE AND ABANDONED YOUR EVIL WAYS
3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU WILL DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS
3915-57461-0025 BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN PUT TO TORMENT YOU
3915-57461-0026 IN A FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROB HER
3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN AND THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S PRESENCE WOULD SOME DAY OVERTAKE ME
3915-57461-0028 AND HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL
3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW YOU MANAGE TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
3915-57461-0030 A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND STILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT
3915-98647-0000 EVERY WELL ORDERED CHINESE HOME OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTER OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOUSE
3915-98647-0001 SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY AND ANNIVERSARY SEASONS THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS
3915-98647-0002 THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHER AS AN SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE
3915-98647-0003 VISITS TO NOTTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION
3915-98647-0004 ALL THESE WERE PUT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA EXCEPT THE CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SON
3915-98647-0005 AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN A LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE
3915-98647-0006 EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILLFUL BALANCER OF PROSE AND KHANS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COLOR OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE
3915-98647-0007 FOR THE GREATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE THE HOME PROPHECIES ARE HELD TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN AND THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED IN
3915-98647-0008 NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY SHOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR
3915-98647-0009 AFTER THIS MANNER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE IS FAIRLY DONE THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS
3915-98647-0010 OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHEN THE ROAD IS RAISED
3915-98647-0011 THE HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BIDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
3915-98647-0012 A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABORERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGEPOLE CASTS DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SCRAMBLE JOYFULLY
3915-98647-0013 ALL COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO WILL NOT COME SEND SERVANTS OR PROVISIONS
3915-98647-0014 ON THE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN A CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS HIS STYLE COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN
3915-98647-0015 NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES A SURVIVAL OF AN OLD TITLE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE
3915-98647-0016 AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE HORSES
3915-98647-0017 THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE PAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL
3915-98647-0018 UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL ALL THE LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS
3915-98647-0019 WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IT IS DRESSED IN WHITE AND SILK HABO TIE WHEN THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT
3915-98647-0020 THE BODY TO BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE THE CHIN RESTING UPON HER KNEES THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS
3915-98647-0021 THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPORTANT FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THE COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THAT THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD
3915-98647-0022 THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEED THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE WATER OF DEATH
3915-98647-0023 LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BALLS OF TEA
3915-98647-0024 SO LONG AS THE COFFIN IS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUED
3915-98647-0025 IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO ON WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES
3915-98647-0026 THERE ARE THE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY
3915-98647-0027 AND INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THESE CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED
3915-98647-0028 A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUKUSAWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING
3915-98647-0029 IN HIS WILL HE REPLIED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING IN THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED
3915-98647-0030 THROUGH THIS GROWING FEELING AT THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES
3915-98647-0031 JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT OUR HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY
3915-98647-0032 ON THE DAY OF THEIR BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT
3915-98647-0033 SOMETIMES WITH A GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THAT FUNERAL TRAIN
3915-98647-0034 ANOTHER FAVOURITE PRECEDENT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON
3915-98647-0035 IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURIAL IT
3915-98647-0036 DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE AND A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET UP IN THE DEATH CHAMBERS BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY
4153-185072-0000 HE TARRIED AT GENESHAW A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP TO GOADO WHERE I THEN RESIDED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE WINTER CAME ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS STAY
4153-185072-0001 THE ENRAGED HUSBAND WELL KNOWING THAT HE SHOULD FEEL A BLOW IF HE WAITED TO HEAR THE ORDER REPEATED INSTANTLY RETREATED AND WENT DOWN THE VILLAGE TO HIS CATTLE
4153-185072-0002 WE PROTECTED THE POOR NATICOKE WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUALS AND ALAN SYMPATHIZED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES TILL SPRING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE PROMISED A REFORMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OF RENEWAL OF HER AFFECTIONS
4153-185072-0003 THE INDIANS WERE SOON ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN OFFICER THAT THE WAMPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS ARDENTLY WISHED TO
4153-185072-0004 MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ALLANE'S HORSE AND CARRIED THE GOODS
4153-185072-0005 ALLEYNE ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT OF HIS RETURN THEY WAS SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTLE'S WHO MARRIED PRISCILLA RAMSAY WITH A SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM
4153-185072-0006 NETTLES AT LENGTH ABANDONED THE CHASE WENT HOME AND ALFEN ALL IN TATTERS CAME IN
4153-185072-0007 BY RUNNING OF THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO RAGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SUFFERING CONDITION ALMOST NAKED
4153-185072-0008 ALLEYNE MADE HIS CLOTHES HIMSELF AND THEN BUILT A RAFT ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MONT MORRIS
4153-185072-0009 THERE AN INDIAN GAVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A GOOD GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE BEARDSTOWN WHERE WE FOUND HIS SQUAW
4153-185072-0010 NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THAT PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING TAKEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GARDO
4153-185072-0011 THE LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SWIFTNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE TO HIS FORMER CASTLE OF SAINT
4153-185072-0012 HIS PURSUERS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETED AND UNDER MINE PROTECTION
4153-185072-0013 STILL UNSATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THEY ADVISED MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME THE SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDERED OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT TO MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF HIS SITUATION AND FINALLY THEY FOUND ME
4153-185072-0014 HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND DROVE ME WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION FEARING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN AND IN A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
4153-185072-0015 AT THE TIME ALLAN LAY IN A SECRET PLACE IN A GULF A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FLATS IN A HOLE THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER
4153-186222-0000 THERE'S NO DANGER IN THIS QUARTER I'M SURE SO I MAY AS WELL BE FRIENDS WITH THE POOR CHILD
4153-186222-0001 AH WHY NOT YOU
4153-186222-0002 NOW BETH HESITATED
4153-186222-0003 THE LETTER ASKING ME TO VISIT HER THE FIRST I HAVE EVER RECEIVED FROM HER
4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE SHE ASKS ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FRIENDLY AND SO I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
4153-186222-0005 SURELY TWO GIRLS WILL HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS LONELY OLD PLACE THAN I COULD HAVE ALONE
4153-186222-0006 OH YES SHE HAS CORRECTED EUSTACE
4153-186222-0007 YOU MEAN PATRICIA DOYLE YOU
4153-186222-0008 THEN WE MAY CONCLUDE SHE'S LEFT OUT OF THEIR ARRANGEMENT SAID BETH CALMLY
4153-186222-0009 YOU'LL FIGHT IT FOR YOUR OWN CHANCE AND FIGHT MIGHTY HARD
4153-186222-0010 WHY MY DEAR COUSIN I I DON'T WANT AUNT JANE'S MONEY
4153-186222-0011 MY MOTHER AND I ARE AMPLY PROVIDED FOR AND I AM ONLY HERE TO FIND REST WITH MY SOCIAL DUTIES AND TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH MY DEAD FATHER'S SISTER THAT IS ALL
4153-186222-0012 MY FATHER TEACHES MUSIC AND MOTHER SCOLDS HIM CONTINUALLY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DATE
4153-186222-0013 WE'VE NEVER SEEN A CENT OF HER MONEY ALTHOUGH FATHER HAS TRIED AT TIMES TO BUY ENOUGH TO HELP HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
4153-186222-0014 I EVEN KISSED HER WHEN SHE ASKED ME TO AND HAS SENT A SHIVER ALL DOWN MY BACK
4153-186222-0015 FOR MY PART I AM FOND OF NO ONE AND IT DELIGHTS ME TO FUSS AROUND INVALIDS AND ASSIST THEM
4153-186222-0016 YOU SAY YOU'LL LIKE TO CARE FOR IN MILLET'S AND I DON'T
4153-186222-0017 YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME THINK YOU DON'T MEAN ELMHURST WHEN YOU'RE AS ANXIOUS TO GET IT AS I AM
4153-186222-0018 THEY CALL ME BETH SULLENLY I
4153-186222-0019 THEY COULDN'T LIVE IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW
4153-186222-0020 BUT SUPPOSED SHE LEAVES IT TO YOU PERSISTED BET
4153-186222-0021 THE LOUISE SEEMED TO MEDITATE
4153-186222-0022 IT'S A MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID BETH LOOKING AT HER COUSIN DOUBTFULLY AND
4153-186222-0023 NOW SHALL WE BE FRIENDS SHE ASKED LIGHTLY AND
4153-186222-0024 TO BE SURE I SHOULD WANT YOU TO MY SIR
4153-186222-0025 SUCH A GIRL FRIEND IT HAD NEVER BEEN HER PRIVILEGE TO HAVE BEEN BEFORE AND WHEN HER SUSPICIONS WERE FORGOTTEN SHE BECAME FAIRLY RESPONSIVE AND BRIGHTENED WONDERFULLY
4153-186222-0026 SILAS SHE SAID WHEN HE WENT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY NIECES
4153-186222-0027 THEY ARE VERY CHARMING GIRLS HE ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THEY ARE AT AN AGE WHEN FEW GIRLS SHOW TO AN ADVANTAGE
4153-186222-0028 WHY DID YOU NOT INVITE KETNES TO DINNER JANE THE BOY
4153-186222-0029 OH HE IS CONSTANTLY SAYING DISAGREEABLE THINGS
4153-186222-0030 VERY WELL SAID THE LAWYER QUIETLY WHICH OF MY NIECES DO YOU PROFESS
4153-186222-0031 ASKED THE OLD LADY AFTER A PAUSE I CANNOT SAY ON SO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE HE ANSWERED WITH GRAVITY IN WHICH DO YOU PREFER JANE
4153-186222-0032 THEY ARE FREQUENTLY UNSATISFACTORY SHE ANSWERED
4153-186222-0033 I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE ELMHURST BELONGING TO EITHER SILAS
4153-186222-0034 I MUST SEE THAT OTHER NIECE THE ONE WHO DEFIES ME AND REFUSES TO ANSWER MY NEXT LETTER
4153-186222-0035 THERE WOULD BE A DOZEN HEIRS TO FIGHT FOR THEIR MONEY AND DEAR OLD ELMHURST WOULD BE SOLD TO STRANGERS SHE RESUMED WITH BITTERNESS
4153-186223-0000 IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE ROOM KENNETH FORBES SQUATTED UPON A BENCH WITH AN EMPTY PINEBOX HELD CARELESSLY IN HIS LAP
4153-186223-0001 WHILE DUNCAN WORKED THE BOY WAS BUSY WITH HIS PARCELS BUT NEITHER HAD SPOKEN FOR AT LEAST A HALF HOUR
4153-186223-0002 THEN RIDING SLOWLY UP THE HEDGE BORDERED ROAD HIS TROUBLES ONCE MORE ASSAILED HIM AND HE WONDERED IF THERE WAS NOT SOME SPOT UPON THE BROAD EARTH TO WHICH HE COULD FLY FOR A RETIREMENT UNTIL THE GIRLS HAD LEFT ELMHURST FOR GOOD
4153-186223-0003 NORAH SHIED WHEN HE LOOKED UP TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAD NEARLY RUN DOWN A PEDESTRIAN A STOUT LITTLE MAN WITH A BUNDLE UNDER HIS ARM WHO HELD UP ONE HAND AS IF TO ARREST HIM
4153-186223-0004 WHERE DO YOU INTEND TO GO ASKED THE BOY
4153-186223-0005 THEN IT'S THE SAME SCENE AS EVER HE RESPONDED WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
4153-186223-0006 DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT OF I HOPED SHE'D REFORMED AND I'D BE GLAD TO SEE HER AGAIN THEY TELL ME SHE'S GOT MONEY
4153-186223-0007 AUNT JANE'S RICH AUNT JANE I
4153-186223-0008 ECHOED THE MAN QUICKLY WHAT OF YOUR NAME LAD
4153-186223-0009 DON'T LIKE GIRLS I THINK IF
4153-186223-0010 ANOTHER LONG PAUSE THEN THE BOY SUDDENLY TURNED QUESTION IN
4153-186223-0011 YOU KNOW AUNTS MISS MERRICK SIR
4153-186223-0012 I WISHED TO WHEN WE WERE BOTH YOUNGER
4153-186223-0013 KENNETH STOPPED SHORT AND THE MAYOR STOPPED AND THE OLD MAN WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT ALSO STOPPED
4153-186223-0014 JOHN MERRICK THAT'S YE
4153-186223-0015 YOU WERE WITH THE TINSMITH
4153-186223-0016 THEY KEPT TRACK OF HER BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY BECAME RICH AND A GREAT LADY AND THAT WAS A SURPRISING THING TO HAPPEN TO A MERRIAC
4153-186223-0017 THANK YOU LAD RETURNED THE MAN GRATEFULLY I THOUGHT A LITTLE EXERCISE WOULD DO ME GOOD BUT THIS THREE MILES HAS SEEMED LIKE THREE TO ME
4153-186223-0018 I WILL SAID THE COUNT
4153-186223-0019 THE BOY TURNED AWAY BUT IN A MOMENT HALTED ME
4153-186223-0020 HIS INTEREST IN MISS MARY'S BROTHER JOHN WAS EXTRAORDINARY
4153-61735-0000 THEY ARE BUT LUKEWARM LOVERS WHO CAN CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH A DIALOGUE CARRIED ON AT A BEAUSHOT DISTANCE
4153-61735-0001 IF THERE WAS AN ELYSIUM ON EARTH IT IS THIS
4153-61735-0002 HIS OWN DAUGHTER HIS ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE BEST BLOOD OF THE SOUTHERN ARISTOCRACY BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING TO SECURE HIM A SPLENDID ALLIANCE HOLDING KNIGHTLY ASSIGNATION WITH A HORSE HUNTER
4153-61735-0003 HE COULD WELL CONCEDE SO MUCH TO HER CAPRICE SINCE HER STAYING AT HOME COULD BE NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE CAUSE THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM AND TO THE STERN COUNCIL
4153-61735-0004 IT IS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THIS ROAD PASSED THE HACIENDA OF A CASA DEL CORVO AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER
4153-61735-0005 ON REACHING THE COPSE HE DISMOUNTED LET HIS HORSE IN AMONG THE UNDERWOOD HITCHED HIM BY LOOPING HIS BRIDLE REIN AROUND THE TOPMOST TWIGS OF AN ELASTIC BOW THEN DETACHING A LONG ROPE OF TWISTED HORSEHAIR FROM THE HORN OF HIS SADDLE AND INSERTING HIS ARM INTO ITS COIL HE GLIDED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND ON THAT SIDE THAT LAY TOWARDS THE HACIENDA
4153-61735-0006 BEFORE FORSAKING THE SHADOW OF THE FOREST HE CAST A GLANCE TOWARD THE SKY AND AT THE MOON SAILING SUPREMELY OVER IT
4153-61735-0007 THE DROLL CONCEIT WHICH HAS SO OFT AMUSED THE NOCTURNAL INEBRIATE OF GREAT CITIES APPEARED TO PRODUCE A LIKE EFFECT UPON THE NIGHT PATROLLER OF THE PRAIRIE AND FOR A MOMENT THIS SHADOW LATE DARKENING HIS BROW DISAPPEARED
4153-61735-0008 IT'S NOT LIKELY IF THESE ARE UNLESS IT BE THE OWNER OF A BAD CONSCIENCE AND CAN'T SLEEP
4153-61735-0009 TROTH THERE'S ONE SUCH WITHIN HIS WALLS
4153-61735-0010 IF HE BE ABROAD THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF HIS SEEING ME ON THE OPEN GROUND NOT THAT I SHOULD CARE A STRAW IF IT WERE ONLY ON MYSELF TO BE COMPROMISED
4153-61735-0011 IT'S NO USE WAITING UPON THE MOON DEUCE DERE
4153-61735-0012 IT IS TRUE HE HAD DESIGNS UPON THE HACIENDA BUT THESE DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EITHER HIS CASH PLATE OR JEWELLERY IF WE ACCEPT THE MOST PRECIOUS JEWEL IT CONTAINED THE MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HERSELF
4323-13259-0000 THE CHURCH BELLS WERE RINGING AND PEOPLE ON THE AVENUE GOING ON TO SERVICE TURNED CURIOUS INQUIRING LOOKS UP AT THE GREAT HOUSE AND THEN WENT ON TALKING OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD SO STRANGELY ENTERED INTO AND MADE HISTORY IN THE CITY
4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSIONED APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE PEOPLE PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMOND THEN VOTED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SALOON
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAYMOND STOOD CONDEMNED BY A RESULT
4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT THAT RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULED
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT THERE HIS USUALLY ERECT HANDSOME FIRM BRIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 WHAT IF HE HAD BEGUN TO DO AS MISSUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 WHEN HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TERROR
4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDISTURBED BY ANY PUBLIC EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 HE HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WELLS OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKY POWER IN RAYMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOR EVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS COULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEETINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERISED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON AND ITS AWFUL CRUSH
4323-13259-0013 GRAY AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRERS WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOREEN'S FRIENDS OR ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO IN PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 GREY HAD GONE OFF TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER AND MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERALS SAID GREY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LOREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAID HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOUR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY HIS JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PAGE THINK BEST WILL BE DONE
4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DISPLAY AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENTLY
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND ON ITS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN A NEIGHBORING CITY
4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DARKARD AND YET THE SERVICES OF THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS OF SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FAIRLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND A CENTRE OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALOONS
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUEER PART OF THIS STRANGE STORY
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SCENES I EVER WITNESSED
4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT A MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY
4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO MORE INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS PHRONSIE TURNED FEARFULLY AWAY
4323-18416-0001 I'LL CRY AND SHE LAID A QUICK HAND ON THE KNOB
4323-18416-0002 TWO RED SPOTS BURNED ON HER CHEEKS BUT HER PALE BLUE EYES SNAPPED
4323-18416-0003 THOUGH I AM SURE I HEARD IT RAGING UP AND DOWN
4323-18416-0004 I DON'T WANT ANY DINNER SAID CHARLOTTE TRYING BACK
4323-18416-0005 YES INDEED SAID POLLY CHEERILY JUST AS FAR AS CAN BE
4323-18416-0006 ASSUREDLY SAID OLD MISTER KING WITH GREAT SATISFACTION IN POLLY'S PLEASURE AND AT HER SUCCESS IN DRAWING CHARLOTTE UP
4323-18416-0007 AND AFTER THIS THERE WERE NO MORE QUIET DAYS FOR CHARLOTTE JARTON
4323-18416-0008 OH BLESS ME IT'S YOU PHRONSIE HE IN PLEASED SURPRISE
4323-18416-0009 YES GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE COMING IN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR CAREFULLY I CAME ON PURPOSE TO SEE YOU OUT ALONE
4323-18416-0010 SO YOU DID DEAR SAID MISTER KING HIGHLY GRATIFIED AND PUSHING AWAY HIS WRITING TABLE SHE HELD OUT HIS HAND
4323-18416-0011 OH NO GRANDPAPA CRIED PHRONSIE IN A RAPTURE I COULD NEVER BE TOO GREAT FOR THAT SO SHE PERCHED UP AS OF OLD ON HIS KNEE THEN SHE FOLDED HER HANDS AND LOOKED GRAVELY IN HIS FACE

4323-18416-0019 GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE WASN'T MISSUS CHATTERTON AUNT IN CHARLOTTE
4323-18416-0020 IF MISSUS CHATTERTON WAS AUNT TO CHARLOTTE PERSISTED PHRONSIE SLOWLY IT SEEMS AS IF CHARLOTTE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF HER MONEY IT REALLY DOES GRANDPAPA

4323-55228-0000 THE NEXT MINUTE HE FELL BACK IN AMAZEMENT BEFORE THE IMPETUOUS RUSH OF A STARRY EYED FLUSHED CHEEKED YOUNG WOMAN WHO DEMANDED
4323-55228-0001 WHERE IS HE PETE MISS BILLY GASPED OLD MAN
4323-55228-0002 AUNT HANNAH'S CHEEKS TOO WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES STARRY BUT WITH DISMAY AND HUNGER THE LAST BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PETE HAD SAID MISS BILLY'S NAME
4323-55228-0003 IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO IT OF COURSE HE'S SHE
4323-55228-0004 RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE IS IT
4323-55228-0005 INTERRUPTED BILLY TELL MISTER BERTRAM I'M HERE OR WAIT I'LL GO RIGHT IN AND SURPRISE HIM
4323-55228-0006 PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE TOWARD AUNT HANNAH WHEN

4323-55228-0008 IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT HE'S IN THE DEN MISS ANNIE
4323-55228-0009 BILLY TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD TAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARD THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AUNT HANNAH'S INDIGNANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BILLY START
4323-55228-0010 PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PAULE'S LIPS TWITCHED
4323-55228-0011 BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVER WHEN HE SPOKE
4323-55228-0012 THAT FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN
4323-55228-0013 DONGLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A STRINGD NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY
4323-55228-0014 IN THE HALL BELOW AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GRAY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE
4323-55228-0015 THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL ANYTHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL
4323-55228-0016 AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS RESTABLE
4323-55228-0017 WHY OF COURSE STAMMERED BILLY I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU HAD FOUND OUT WHO DIDN'T WANT ME
4323-55228-0018 DEMANDED BERTRAM ANGRY AND MYSTIFIED OH
4323-55228-0019 AS FOR MY NOT PAINTING AGAIN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE DEAR HE
4323-55228-0020 SHE PULLED HERSELF HALF UP AWAY FROM BERTRAM'S ENCIRCLING ARM
4323-55228-0021 BILLY DREW HER QUIVERING SIGH
4323-55228-0022 OH GOOD HEAVENS IS KATE IN THIS TOO BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS SAVAGE NOW
4323-55228-0023 AND WELL SHE WROTE A LETTER
4323-55228-0024 BILLY LAUGHED GAYLY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYE
4323-55228-0025 AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT I CARED FOR HIM
4323-55228-0026 HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS AND
4323-55228-0027 BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE OF ARKWRIGHT'S
4323-55228-0028 AFTER A WEEK BILLY STIRRED AND SIGHED HAPPILY
4323-55228-0029 YOU SEE I I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARKWRIGHT
4323-55228-0030 AND AND AND YOU DIDN'T CARE SPECIALLY FOR FOR MISS WINTHROP
4323-55228-0031 BILLY PUT A SOFT FINGER UNDER HIS LIPS
4323-55228-0032 BERTRAM KISSED THE FINGER AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HEED
4323-55228-0033 WELL WHAT IS THAT'S THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY
4323-55228-0034 THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERTRAM STIRRED IT
4323-55228-0035 TO BILLY I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY
4323-55228-0036 I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL THEN YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAYING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY
4323-55228-0037 I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW I'LL GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUND THAT LETTER I FORGOT
4323-55228-0038 BUT FIVE DAYS INDEED SIR
4323-55228-0039 I WONDER IF YOU THINK I CAN GET READY TO BE MARRIED FOR FIVE DAYS
4323-55228-0040 DON'T WANT YOU TO GIT READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT
4323-55228-0041 IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE BUT'
4323-55228-0042 BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUTS IN BERTRAM CRAFTILY
4323-55228-0043 THE TENDER GLOW ON MARY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT
4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GOOD OLD LEFT ARM
4323-55228-0045 BILLY MY DEAR SIR
4323-55228-0046 IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE FACE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER
4323-55228-0047 WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU TOO
4323-55228-0048 NOW YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE OCTOBER
4323-55228-0049 OUR AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNCERTAINLY
4323-55228-0050 I YES NODDED BILLY DEMURELY
4323-55228-0051 YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILES CUT IN BERTRAM MERRILY
4323-55228-0052 WE WANT IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW
4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LOOKED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT EXPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFILL
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT ON THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS CELLARED DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS RESPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT
4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF HER WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK
4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S JUDGMENT
4515-11057-0006 HE WROTE TO MARIAN OH
4515-11057-0007 AND WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME AND SEE ME
4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFIN AS LIKELY TO HELP HIMSELF
4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THE DEUCE SHOULD HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
4515-11057-0010 I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING YOU SOME NEWS
4515-11057-0011 POVERTY I CAN ONLY OBSERVE
4515-11057-0012 BUT I WILL SEE WHELPSDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS VIFFIN FOR A LONG TIME
4515-11057-0013 WAS HE STILL SO VERY LITTLE
4515-11057-0014 ASKED AMY COMPASSIONATELY OH
4515-11057-0015 I'M AFRAID SO HIS FOOT FAILED UTTERLY
4515-11057-0016 OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS CAUSE
4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I KNEW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUTS THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
4515-11057-0020 AMINY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN
4515-11057-0021 HOWEVER NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
4515-11057-0022 IS IT NOT SO SERIOUS
4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS FAITH IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
4515-11057-0024 OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT THEY
4515-11057-0025 HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDENTALLY
4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON' NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE
4515-11057-0027 THERE WAS SILENCE SILENCE
4515-11057-0028 THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO LIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
4515-11057-0029 RECALLING WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME
4515-11057-0030 JUST JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT
4515-11057-0031 YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN MY WORK OR RECENTLY
4515-11057-0032 DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CURRENT AND SO ON CONTINUALLY
4515-11057-0033 SOMETIMES I BELIEVE WE HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
4515-11057-0034 HER STORY IN THAT GIRL'S PAPER HAS ATTRACTING ATTENTION
4515-11057-0035 AND I HAD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
4515-11057-0036 I SURMISED THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT TO REST BY SUCH A DECISION
4515-11057-0037 DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILES HE PLEADED
4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND CUSTOMS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT CAN I DO
4515-11057-0039 THEIR CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE
4515-11057-0040 WELL I'LL GO BACK TO OUR SCRIBBLING
4515-11057-0041 AGAIN JASPER HELD THE WHITE SOFT HAND FOR THE SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT
4515-11057-0042 YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRILY
4515-11057-0043 MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON THEIR COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASONS FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER HEART
4515-11057-0045 IF HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY
4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN ADDED HE
4515-11057-0047 THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THEIR BATTLE
4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIANN WHAT
4515-11057-0049 NOW YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER
4515-11057-0050 MORE OF A BRUTE YOU MAN
4515-11057-0051 THAT YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DON'T
4515-11057-0052 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO OUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY
4515-11057-0053 DICK
4515-11057-0054 WILL YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR TIME
4515-11057-0055 THAT YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT
4515-11057-0056 I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT IT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER
4515-11057-0057 SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM AND TOUCHINGLY
4515-11057-0058 DEAR I CAN'T THINK IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND
4515-11057-0059 THERE ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU
4515-11057-0060 WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A POOR PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN
4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HER
4515-11057-0062 SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED I
4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE'S A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU WERE MY WIFE
4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WELL THEN THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO DO
4515-11057-0065 EXCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS CARELESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT
4515-11057-0066 DO YE THINK THE INSURMOUNTABLE
4515-11057-0067 THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTHS
4515-11057-0068 I DON'T TRUST MYSELF THEN
4515-11057-0069 BUT SHALL YOU FACE THEM TRYINGLY
4515-11057-0070 AND PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MARIAN
4515-11057-0071 WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL HER LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD YOU CAN SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME
4515-11057-0073 WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL THAT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0074 IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUST YOURSELF AND
4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARIAN AND
4515-11057-0076 HOW AM I TO FIND AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS
4515-11057-0077 I MAY WISH IT
4515-11057-0078 BUT HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED
4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING ON HER PARENTS
4515-11057-0080 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T LET YOU ADVISE ME
4515-11057-0081 IS THERE ANY WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY FATHER
4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIANN I CAN'T STAND IT
4515-11057-0083 I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU OH
4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT WILLIAM TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
4515-11057-0085 MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUND SOBBING
4515-11057-0086 IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE OF SELFISHNESS
4515-11057-0087 BUT I COULDN'T SAY ONE WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
4515-11057-0088 YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END TO EVERYTHING
4515-11057-0089 HAPPINESS OR MISERY COMETH TO US BY FATE
4515-11057-0090 IS IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YE HAPPY
4515-11057-0091 BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAD ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
4515-11057-0092 AND IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU
4515-11057-0093 WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN WHAT YOU HAVE SAID NOW
4515-11057-0094 I REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO
4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE SHOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT
4515-11057-0096 WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN HIS TRUTH
4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT MONEY DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0098 MARIANN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME
4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH AND
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST
4515-11057-0101 JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY NO
4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM JUST
4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARIAN YOU CANN'T WORK
4515-11057-0104 BUT I MUST AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
4515-11057-0105 GOOD BYE SHE GAVE THEM HER HAND
4515-11057-0106 THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WENT QUICKLY AWAY
4515-11057-0107 BUT JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED HIS GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TONES AND ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHICH SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
4515-11057-0110 YESTERDAY THE MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY WORTHY HE IS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOU RE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME NO REPLY
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTELY ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY AND
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY HIS SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LIFE
4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION
4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF HER INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTEE TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFRONTED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRES TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SURPRISE
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING ON THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOR IT IS VERY MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 BUT PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MIGHT EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT ON THE BIGGER HOUND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEGGLE
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH NORTHERN OR OTTERHOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE

4831-25894-0033 LITTLE RONZO WAS ACCEPTED WITH DELIGHT BY THE OLD LADY AND HER CHILDREN AND TESSA LEARNED THE SONG QUITE EASILY
4831-25894-0034 AROSE FROM THE CROWD OF CHILDREN GATHERED ABOUT THE FESTIVAL
4831-25894-0035 BEFORE THEY WENT HOME THE KIND MAMMA TOLD TESSA THAT SHE SHOULD BE HER FRIEND AND GAVE HER A MOTHERLY KISS WHICH WARMED THE CHILD'S HEART AND SEEMED TO SET A SEAL UPON THAT PROMISE
4831-29134-0000 THE SENATOR TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE PULPIT AND THE MINISTER ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL ON THE OTHER
4831-29134-0001 SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE PRESENCE OF A LIVING UNITED STATES SENATOR THAT DURING THREE YEARS NOT A SPITBALL WAS THROWN
4831-29134-0002 AFTER THE THEY BEGAN TO COME TO THEMSELVES BY DEGREES AND PRESENTLY THE SPELL WAS WHOLLY GONE AND THEY WERE RECITING VERSES AND PULLING HAIR
4831-29134-0003 THE USUAL SUNDAY SCHOOL EXERCISES WERE HURRIED THROUGH AND THEN THE MINISTER GOT UP AND BORED THE HOUSE WITH A SPEECH BUILT ON THE CUSTOMARY SUNDAY SCHOOL PLANT THEN THE SUPERINTENDENT PUT IN HIS OAR THEN THE TOWN DIGNITARIES HAD THEIR SAY

4831-29134-0013 AND BY AND BY ALL THE PEOPLE MADE HIM GOVERNOR AND HE SAID IT WAS ALL OWING TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
4831-29134-0014 WHY THE PEOPLE GAVE HIM A TOWERING ILLUSTRIOUS POSITION A GRAND IMPOSING VISION
4831-29134-0015 IT WAS SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES I
4831-29134-0016 THAT POOR LITTLE BOY THAT LEFT HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL AND BECAME THAT MAN THAT MAN STANDS BEFORE YOU
4831-29134-0017 YOU ABOVE ALL THINGS MY CHILDREN BE HONEST
4831-29134-0018 WHEN SENATOR DILWORTHY DEPARTED FROM CADALLVILLE HE LEFT THREE DOZEN BOYS BEHIND HIM ARRANGING THE CAMPAIGN OF LIFE WHOSE OBJECTIVE POINT WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATE
5543-27761-0000 LU NOTCHKA WAS A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
5543-27761-0001 THERE WAS NO OTHER SUCH CROWD THERE NEVER HAD BEEN AND THERE NEVER WOULD BE
5543-27761-0002 LUETTECHKA'S MOTHER SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA WAS SURE OF THAT
5543-27761-0003 LULLETARKA'S EYES WERE DARK AND LARGE HER CHEEKS WERE ROSY HER LIPS WERE MADE FOR KISSES AND FOR LAUGHTER
5543-27761-0004 BUT IT WAS NOT THESE CHARMS IN LAETCHKA THAT GAVE HER FATHER THE KEENEST JOY
5543-27761-0005 HE FELT COLD WITH HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0006 HE WAS ALWAYS FRESH AND COOL WITH A FRIGID SMILE AND WHEREVER HE PASSED COLD CURRENTS SEEMED TO WAVE IN THE AIR
5543-27761-0007 IT EVEN SEEMED TO O SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER FUTURE HUSBAND AND THIS MADE HER HAPPY
5543-27761-0008 THE BRIDE WAS ALSO GOOD LOOKED SHE WAS A TALL DARK EYED DARK HAIRED GIRL SOMEWHAT TIMID BUT VERY TACTFUL
5543-27761-0009 HE HAD CONNEXIONS AND HIS WIFE BECAME OF GOOD INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE
5543-27761-0010 THIS MIGHT AT THE PROPER OPPORTUNITY PROVE SUCCESSFUL
5543-27761-0011 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MANNER OF SERGEY MOROSTOVITCH TO SUGGEST ANYTHING WRONG FOR HIS WIFE
5543-27761-0012 LATER HOWEVER WHEN HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD SERGEY MOCHISTOVITCH ESTABLISHED CONNECTIONS ELSEWHERE OF A LIGHT AND TEMPORARY NATURE
5543-27761-0013 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA FOUND THIS OUT AND TO HER OWN ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY HURT SHE AWAITED HER INFANT WITH A RESTLESS ANTICIPATION THAT SWALLOWED EVERY FEELING
5543-27761-0014 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA DRIFTED FARTHER AND FARTHER FROM HIM
5543-27761-0015 LUDSHKA THEN RAN AWAY STAMPING WITH HER PLUMP LITTLE LEGS OVER THE CARPETS AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR HER BED
5543-27761-0016 WHERE'S MY BABY GIRL THE MOTHER ASKED AS SHE LOOKED FOR LOLLATCHKA AND MADE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID NOT SEE HER
5543-27761-0017 THEN SHE CAME OUT A LITTLE FARTHER AND HER MOTHER AS THOUGH SHE HAD ONLY JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SEIZED HER BY HER LITTLE SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED JOYOUSLY HERE SHE IS MY LALEETCHKA
5543-27761-0018 HER MOTHER'S EYES GLOWED WITH PATIENT EMOTION
5543-27761-0019 HER MOTHER WENT TO FIND
5543-27761-0020 LUETCHKA TURNED AWAY AS THOUGH NOT TO SEE BUT WATCHED HER MOMMOCHKA STEALTHILY ALL THE TIME
5543-27761-0021 WHERE'S MY MAMA MOCHKA ASKED LUETSHKA
5543-27761-0022 A SMILE OF ABSOLUTE BLISS PLAYED ON HER VERY LIPS
5543-27761-0023 THE LACHKA WAS GETTING NEAR HER MOTHER'S CORNER
5543-27761-0024 AND HER MOTHER WAS GROWING MORE ABSORBED EVERY MOMENT BY HER INTEREST IN THE GAME HER HEART BEAT WITH SHORT QUICK STROKES AND SHE PRESSED EVEN CLOSER TO THE WALL DISARRANGING HER HAIR STILL MORE
5543-27761-0025 VALLETCHKA SUDDENLY GLANCED TOWARD HER MOTHER'S CORNER AND SCREAMED WITH JOY
5543-27761-0026 THROUGH THE HALF CLOSED DOORS HE HEARD THE LAUGHTER THE JOYOUS OUTCRIES THE SOUND OF A ROMPING
5543-27761-0027 EVEN PHODSIA FELT ABASHED NOW FOR HER MISTRESS NOW FOR HERSELF
5543-27761-0028 HE LIKED COMING HERE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED THIS WAS DONE BY SARAFIKA ALEXANDROVNA WHO WISHED TO SURROUND HER LITTLE GIRL FROM HER VERY INFANCY ONLY WITH THE LOVELIEST THINGS
5543-27761-0029 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA DRESSED HERSELF TASTEFULLY THIS TOO SHE DID FOR LULLETCHKA WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW
5543-27761-0030 ONE THING SERGEY MOGOSTOVITCH HAD NOT BECOME RECONCILED TO AND THIS WAS HIS WIFE'S ALMOST CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN THE NURSERY
5543-27761-0031 IT'S JUST AS I THOUGHT I KNEW AS I'D FIND YOU HERE HE SAID WITH A DERISIVE AND CONDESCENDING SMILE
5543-27761-0032 MERELY YOU SEE THAT THE CHILD SHOULD FEEL HIS OWN INDIVIDUALITY HE EXPLAINED IN ANSWER TO SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA'S PUZZLED GLANCE
5543-27761-0033 SHE'S ALWAYS SO LITTLE SAID SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0034 I DON'T INSIST IT'S YOUR KINGDOM YES
5543-27761-0035 I'LL THINK IT OVER HIS WIFE ANSWERED SMILING AS IF HE DID COLDLY BUT GENIALLY
5543-27761-0036 THEN THEY BEGAN TO TALK TO SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0037 NOW THE MISTRESS DOES IT WELL THAT'S ONE THING BUT THAT THE YOUNG LADY DOES IT THAT'S BAD
5543-27761-0038 WHY ASKED FEDOCHO WITH CURIOSITY
5543-27761-0039 THE EXPRESSION OF CURIOSITY GAVE HER FACE THE LOOK OF A WOMAN ROUGHLY PAINTED DOLL
5543-27761-0040 YES THAT'S BAD REPEATED ALATHYO WITH CONVICTION TERRIBLY BAD WELL
5543-27761-0041 IT'S THE TRUTH I'M SAYING REMEMBER MY WORDS AGAFYA WENT ON WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE AND SECRECY
5543-27761-0042 AND IT'S THE SUREST SIGN
5543-27761-0043 THE OLD WOMAN HAD INVENTED THIS SIGN QUITE SUDDENLY HERSELF AND SHE IS EVIDENTLY VERY PROUD OF IT
5543-27761-0044 AND MADAM SHE SAID QUIETLY IN A TREMBLING VOICE
5543-27761-0045 SRAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA GAVE A START
5543-27761-0046 FEDOSYO'S FACE MADE HER ANXIOUS
5543-27761-0047 WHAT IS IT FEDOSYA SHE ASKED WITH GREAT CONCERN IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH LUOLETCHKA
5543-27761-0048 NO MADAME SAID FEDOSY AS SHE GESTICULATED WITH HER HANDS TO REASSURE HER MISTRESS AND TO MAKE HER SIT DOWN
5543-27761-0049 LUCHKA'S ASLEEP MAY GOD BE WITH HER
5543-27761-0050 ONLY I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING YOU SEE LOLLETSHKA IS ALWAYS HIDING HERSELF THAT IS NOT GOOD
5543-27761-0051 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BAD IT IS SAID ADOSIA AND HER FACE EXPRESSED THE MOST DECIDED CONFIDENCE
5543-27761-0052 I UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF WHAT YOU ARE TELLING
5543-27761-0053 YOU SEE MADAM IT'S A KIND OF OMEN EXPLAINS FIDOSYA ABRUPTLY IN A SHAMEFACED WAY
5543-27761-0054 NONSENSE SAID SARAFI MA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0055 WHO TOLD YOU ALL THIS ASKED SARAFIME ALEXANDROVNA IN AN AUSTERE LOW VOICE
5543-27761-0056 HOW EXCLAIMED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA IN IRRITATION AS THOUGH SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HERSELF SOMEHOW FROM THIS SUDDEN ANXIETY
5543-27761-0057 WHAT NONSENSE AS THOUGH LULLOCHKA COULD DIE
5543-27761-0058 SHE SAW CLEARLY THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN A CHILD'S QUITE ORDINARY DIVERSION AND THE CONTINUATION OF THE CHILDS LIFE
5543-27761-0059 SHE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT THAT EVENING TO OCCUPY HER MIND WITH OTHER MATTERS BUT HER THOUGHTS TURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO THE FACT THAT LULEETCHKA LOVED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0060 WHEN LUTKKA WAS STILL QUITE SMALL AND HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HER NURSE SHE SOMETIMES SITTING IN HER NURSE'S ARMS MADE A SUDDEN ROGUISH GRIMACE AND HID HER LAUGHING FACE IN THE NURSE'S SHOULDER
5543-27761-0061 THAT SHE WOULD LOOK OUT WITH A SLY GLANCE
5543-27761-0062 THOUGH SHE REPROACHED HERSELF AT ONCE FOR THIS UNFOUNDED SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD NOT ENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF LULETCHKA'S FAVOURITE GAME AND SHE TRIED TO DIVERT LULETCHKA'S ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0063 SHE EAGERLY COMPLIED WITH A MOTHER'S NEW WISHES
5543-27761-0064 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA TRIED DESPERATELY TO AMUSE LULETSKA
5543-27761-0065 PERHAPS THOUGHT SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA SHE IS NOT AS STRONGLY DRAWN TO THE WORLD AS OTHER CHILDREN WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY THINGS
5543-27761-0066 IF THIS IS SO IS IT NOT A SIGN OF ORGANICAL WEAKNESS
5543-27761-0067 SYRAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA HERSELF BEGAN THE GAME ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH SHE PLAYED IT WITH A HEAVY HEART
5543-27761-0068 SHE SUFFERED AS THOUGH COMMITTING AN EVIL DEED WITH FULL JUSTICE
5543-27761-0069 IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR SARAFIAM ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0070 MY MOTHER COVERED HER WITH A BLUE BLANKET
5543-27761-0071 LULLTCHKA DREW HER SWEET LITTLE HANDS FROM UNDER THE BLANKET AND STRETCHED THEM OUT TO EMBRACE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER BENT DOWN
5543-27761-0072 SHE SEEMED SO SMALL AND SO FRAIL UNDER THE BLANKET THAT COVERED HERSELF
5543-27761-0073 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA REMAINED STANDING OVER LULETCHKA'S BED A LONG WHILE AND SHE KEPT LOOKING AT LUETCHIKA WITH TENDERNESS AND FEAR
5543-27761-0074 I'M A MOTHER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT HER SHE THOUGHT AS SHE IMAGINED THE VARIOUS ILLS THAT MIGHT BEFALL ALLATSHKA
5543-27761-0075 SHE PRAYED ONLY THAT NIGHT BUT THE PRAYER DID NOT RELIEVE HER SADNESS
5543-27761-0076 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED LUKECHKA CAUGHT COLD
5543-27761-0077 THE FEVER CAME UPON HER AT TIMES
5543-27761-0078 WHEN SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA AWAKENED BY FIDOSYA CAME TO LAETCHKA AND SAW HER LOOKING SO HOT SO RESTLESS AND SO TORMENTED SHE INSTANTLY RECALLED THE EVIL OMEN AND A HOPELESS DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HER FOR THE FIRST MOMENTS
5543-27761-0079 A DOCTOR WAS CALLED IN EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS BUT THE INEVITABLE HAPPENED
5543-27761-0080 AND LUNTCHKA GREW FEEBLER FROM HOUR TO HOUR
5543-27761-0081 NOTHING MADE HER SO UNHAPPY AS THE REITERATIONS OF FEDOSYA UTTERED BETWEEN SOBS SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF AROTOLECHKA
5543-27761-0082 FEVER WAS CONSUMING LAETCHKA AND THERE WERE TIME WHEN SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND SPOKE IN DELIRIUM
5543-27761-0083 THREE DAYS HAD PASSED TORTURING LIKE A NIGHTMARE
5543-27761-0084 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA HID HER FACE BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR LULETHKA'S BED HOW TRAGIC
5543-27761-0085 AWAIT MAMOTCHKA WHISPERED LULUTZKA
5543-27761-0086 MOMOTCHKA'S WHITE FACE BECAME BLURRED AND EVERY THING GREW DARK BEFORE LULLETSHKA
5543-27761-0087 BUT SHE MET HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0088 SARAFIMO ALEXANDROVNA WAS STANDING BY THE COFFIN AND LOOKING DULLY AT HER DEAD CHILD
5543-27761-0089 SIERA MY DEAR DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF SAID SERGEY MOLOSTOVITCH IN A WHISPER
5543-27761-0090 YOU MUST RESIGN YOURSELF TO YOUR FATE AND
5543-27761-0091 SHE'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE PERSISTED SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA HER EYES FIXED UPON THE DEAD LITTLE GIRL
5543-27761-0092 SERGEY MOROZAOVITCH LOOKED ROUND HIM CAUTIOUSLY HE WAS AFRAID OF THE UNSEEMLY AND OF THE RIDICULOUS
5543-27761-0093 SIYMA DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF HE REPEATED
5543-27761-0094 NO HE WAS CONFUSED AND ANNOYED
5543-27761-0095 HER FACE SEEM TRANQUIL AND HER EYES WERE DRY
5543-27761-0096 SHE WENT INTO THE NURSERY AND BEGAN TO WALK ROUND THE ROOM LOOKING INTO THOSE PLACES WHERE LULLETTKA USED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0097 SHE WALKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND BENT NOW AND THEN TO LOOK UNDER THE TABLE OR UNDER THE BED AND KEPT ON REPEATING CHEERFULLY WHERE'S MY LITTLE ONE WHERE IS MY LUELETCHKA
5543-27761-0098 AFTER SHE HAD WALKED ROUND THE ROOM ONCE SHE BEGAN TO MAKE HER QUESTS ANEW
5543-27761-0099 FEDOSYA MOTIONLESS WITH DEJECTED FACE SAT IN A CORNER AND LOOKED FRIGHTENED AT HER MISTRESS THEN SHE SUDDENLY BURST OUT SOBBING AND SHE WAILING LOUDLY
5543-27761-0100 SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LAOLETCHKA ER ANGELIC LITTLE SOUL
5543-27761-0101 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOUR THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE BETWEEN HER AND LUTCHEDKA
5543-27761-0102 THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF HEAVINESS IN SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA'S HEAD AS SHE APPROACHED LOLLETCHKA
5543-27761-0103 WOOLUTCHKA LAY THERE STILL AND PALE AND SMILED PATHETICALLY
5543-27761-0104 THE LITTLE ONE DID NOT REPLIED
5543-27761-0105 SARAFIA ALEXANDROVNA STOOD UP ERECT SIGHED IN A LOST WAY SMILED AND CALLED LOUDLY LU LETCHKA

5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WATSWORTH BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY THOUGH HE WAS STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THAT MATTER LIGHTLY
5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR THERE IS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR POLITICAL RIGHTS
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VICROY HAS COME TO HARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF A CHARTER IN PERSON
5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF THIS SWORD DECLARED HE SHALL NOT HAVE IT
5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMORIES WERE ENGAGED IN A HEATED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO AWAIT THE DISCUSSIONS BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED HER
5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY DOING ENGAGED IN TO DEBATE

5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DOING RIGHT AT THE TIME NOT TOO SOON NOR TOO LATE
5849-50873-0018 AND THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE CAPTAIN SAID
5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO A ASSEMBLY
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR MOTION
5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PLACE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN RODSWORTH

5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE IN TWO SAT ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO BUNDLES ON THE WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATIONED NEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOW THE FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THIS SCENE
5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOWED IN AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED MY ARM
5849-50873-0028 BOY TO HAVE A CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN THE CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WADSWORTH THE TRAIN VANCS CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS

5849-50873-0034 EVERY OTHER MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY SHOOK THEIR HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE DO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVE IN CONNECTICUT OR DOES HE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL ASSISTANT DREAMED THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARDS KNOWN AS THAT CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED WITH A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER OF THE SEIZURE OF CHARTERS WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN THE ASSEMBLY OF RHODE ISLANDS SENT A MOST LOYAL ADDRESS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMALLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO THEIR LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE FORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF A FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THEIR FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTER TO THE EXPULSION OF ASROSE
5849-50962-0000 CALLED BERTT WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE

5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BUOY WAS WORKING
5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND FARTHER IT CAME UNTIL NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THESE GIRLS AND WOMEN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFEGUARDS AND A MAN IN THE CORK BELT BANDED UP UPON SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND NELLIE WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH A CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FALLING RIGHT BACK INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT A HALF DROWNED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
5849-50962-0018 BUT DOES GEORGE BINGHAM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE BROTHER
5849-50962-0019 SAFE AND WELL CAME THE WELCOME ANSWER ANSWER
5849-50962-0020 I GUESS OUR PRAYER'S WERE HEARD LAST NIGHT
5849-50962-0021 HERE COMES ANOTHER MAN SAID THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A BIG MAN DASHED ON THE SANDS
5849-50962-0022 WHILE I'D DECLARE WE DID STAND ON A FRIENDLY SHORE
5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BINGHAM SAID THE LIFE SAVING WORK TURNED OUT TO BE A SOCIAL AFFAIR FOR THERE WAS A GREAT TIME GREETING NELLIE'S FATHER AND HAL'S MOTHER
5849-50962-0024 AND HAL AND HIS FATHER TOO PUT IN NAN AND
5849-50962-0025 WHAT A MOURNING THAT WAS AT SUNSET BEACH
5849-50962-0026 I'M SO GLAD WE PRAYED YOU SAID LITTLE FLOSSIE TO FREDDIE WHEN SHE HEARD THE GOOD NEWS
5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THE WONDERFUL STORM
5849-50963-0001 AND THEN EVERYBODY WAS SO HAPPY
5849-50963-0002 THE NEPTUNE THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SANDS BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROWBOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK ABOUT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A FEVER
5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT DELAYED US SO LONG
5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EVERY LOG LOADED ON THE SCHOONER AS WE STARTED OFF
5849-50963-0006 WE COUNTED ON GETTING HOME THE LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE ASKED MISTER BOBBSEY WHO WAS THEN FROM THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 THE VALUE RECEIVED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 WELL I'M A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE MC GLAUGHAN FOR THE WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
5849-50963-0010 AH INDEED IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US A LIFETIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN THIS YEAR
5849-50963-0011 MAYBE AUNT ELEANOR WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOPPING TOUR SUGGESTED NAN
5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERKS REMOVE ALL THE TRUCKS FROM THE AISLES AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE MONEY FELL DOWN
5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FACED AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS FAVORITE EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BYE TO YOU NELLIE TOLD DOROTHY AND NANNI NEXT MORNING
5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NANI
5849-50964-0002 YOU ARE QUITE RICH NOW YOU AREN'T YOU REMARKED DOROTHY
5849-50964-0003 AND DOROTHY WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S SAD SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE ON HAND THANKING YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DOROTHY
5849-50964-0005 COME NEDIE CALLED MISSUS MC GLAUGHLAN I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAT
5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NELLI TOLD HIM
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN BUT HE CAN TAKE US THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MOST OF EM I GUESS ANSWERED BEND
5849-50964-0009 WELL WE'VE HAD A GOOD VACATION AND I AM WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED NAN VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH TO THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FREDBY AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOPS THE CAT
5849-50964-0013 AND ALL OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION
6123-59150-0000 AS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISIONED HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF RESOURCE
6123-59150-0003 CERTAINLY THE LUSTS OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 THAT HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL AUTHOR
6123-59150-0005 FOR THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICTS
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LOSS IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LAST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE OF NEKHLUDOFF IN THE RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE EDIERS
6123-59150-0009 ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACCIDENT
6123-59150-0010 EVEN THE TALK IS OF THE ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THAT HAND BUT WITH THE SUCK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOT NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRISTS SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKI OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ENNA KARENINA AND FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHIZE AGAIN WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY A PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST IF AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS MISTER DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES
6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HAVING CUTS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE BETRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS OH
6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT HE SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY
6123-59150-0023 IF WE HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR POET
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PITY
6123-59150-0026 AND DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFFIEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEOKONSKI AGLAYA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VAYA FERUSHENKO NASTASYA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL YVOLGAN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INTIMATES AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS BY DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY IN LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET AND SURROUNDING DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DARED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE YOU ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS IS IT ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DISMAY
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CERTTABOS
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S AND LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARKER NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE BISHKIN IN THE IDIOT
6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS REMARKABLE CONFLICT
6123-59150-0041 THE RIVALS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUDAY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHILE HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF LITTLE SLAVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE WOULD ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS
6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES OR REPELS
6123-59186-0000 HE IS NOT AS BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STRONG
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A TRUE POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BRIEF WORDS OR IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THUS HE WRITES IN I'VE FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE LANGUAGE IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 AND PROSE INTRUDES IN THEIR CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM UPON
6123-59186-0008 WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SIGHS BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 CATERING CARE IS AN APPALLING PROCESS
6123-59186-0010 IS A LINE OF THAT POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME THE MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUOLENT MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 HE HAVE A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED TO MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN A BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES
6123-59186-0016 HIS WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT IN POVERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF HIS MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
6123-59186-0018 TO BE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD LONELY WASTE MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY
6123-59186-0020 BUT NOTHING TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDYS'S POEMS THE OXEN
6123-59186-0022 WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STORY PEN NOR DO IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN
6123-59186-0023 THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOODS
6123-59186-0024 HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG WOMEN WHO MARCH AWAY
6123-59186-0025 HOW LONG HE CRIES TO A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO
6123-59186-0026 WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORN TO STAND THE BOND SLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS
6123-59186-0027 BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTIONING A SENIOR SOUL FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE
6123-59186-0028 AND GENERAL HELL HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS AS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES
6123-59186-0029 SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM NEW LIFES
6123-59186-0030 AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DO THEY IN OUR DEEDS
6123-59186-0031 MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF RELIEF TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR
6123-59186-0032 THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS GOT TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE
6123-59186-0033 IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDCE'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE
6123-59186-0034 FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES IN LIFE
6123-59186-0035 HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS CHILDREN WROUGHT IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY
6123-59186-0036 WE LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH
6123-59186-0037 IN BEYOND THIS LAST LAMP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE
6123-59186-0038 NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON TO YOURS ONE ROBIN EVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES
6123-59186-0039 FOR THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN
6123-59186-0040 NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLED OF DULL HUED DAYS
6267-53049-0000 BUT IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T IT
6267-53049-0001 PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE AULDDER SISTER WISTFULLY
6267-53049-0002 DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAYS
6267-53049-0003 SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMIRED IT FOR THE WORST
6267-53049-0004 SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO DO A NEW DRESS
6267-53049-0005 DORIS HUNTER I BELIEVE IT'S THAT OLD QUILT
6267-53049-0006 LISTEN PENELOPE MY DEAR DOST
6267-53049-0007 LOVE TO PENELOPI AND YOURSELF
6267-53049-0008 IS YOUR AFFECTIONATE AUNT ADELA HUNTER
6267-53049-0009 I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A VAGUE
6267-53049-0010 IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY MUCH BUT IT IS ALL FADED NOW
6267-53049-0011 YOU TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN
6267-53049-0012 IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELA TO SEND IT ME SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY
6267-53049-0013 WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PENELOPE AND
6267-53049-0014 WHAT LOVELY OLD TIMEY STUFF AND NOT A BIT FATIGUE
6267-53049-0015 I DECLARE IT SEEMS AS GOOD AS NEW
6267-53049-0016 WELL LET US GO AND HAVE TEAAT SAID PENELOPE I'VE DECIDEDLY HUNGRY
6267-53049-0017 BESIDES I SEE THE POVERTY BOCKER
6267-53049-0018 IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSES AND HAROL LOOM AFTER ALL
6267-53049-0019 PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY IN THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS A POSITIVE CREATION OF A DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET
6267-53049-0020 SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S GARDEN AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE
6267-53049-0021 PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER CHARMINGLY
6267-53049-0022 SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO MYSELF
6267-53049-0023 MY AUNT ADELA GAVE ME TO GAVE US THE MATERIAL SHE STAMMERED
6267-53049-0024 I'M NAMED AFTER HER MISSUS FAIRWATER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVELY OLD FACE AGLOW WITH LIGHT AND TENDERNESS
6267-53049-0025 THEN YOU ARE MY GRAND DUCHESS SHE SAID
6267-53049-0026 WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESSES I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT ROSE BUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN TIBET
6267-53049-0027 PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I IT WAS BUT WE WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER
6267-53049-0028 SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSE HOLD WERE BROKEN UP
6267-53049-0029 MY DEAR I AM A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO HER
6267-53049-0030 NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRFORD'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY
6267-53049-0031 DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS CHANGED IN THE TWINED CLING OF AN ARM
6267-53049-0032 WHEN MISSUS FAIRWEATHER HAD DONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
6267-65525-0000 AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNTS CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW
6267-65525-0001 OLD JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BABY CLANGING TO THE OTHER
6267-65525-0002 SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERING AND VULGAR AS A SUNFLOWER WAS AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS
6267-65525-0003 I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BIGGSBY IS THIS EVENING SIDDY AN YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK
6267-65525-0004 SYDNEY SIGHED AND WENT BACK STAIRS FOR THE BABY
6267-65525-0005 ALL HER DAYS WERE NOT ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
6267-65525-0006 BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING HIM TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER
6267-65525-0007 THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SYDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL ONES
6267-65525-0008 HER BED AND THE COT WHEN THE LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE
6267-65525-0009 JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A PEA AND THE MOUTHS ZIG ZAGGED FROM EAR TO EAR
6267-65525-0010 SYDNEY HATED THAT MIRROR AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD EAT ANYTHING
6267-65525-0011 HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SYDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THEIR DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID
6267-65525-0012 AND PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO WRITE WITH A FLUSH OF REAL EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE
6267-65525-0013 ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO ELLEN DOUGLAS AND THAT WAS FORWARDED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFFERING EDITOR OF THE MAMPLE LEAF
6267-65525-0014 HE WROTE THAT ALTHOUGH HIS AGE DEBRED HIM FROM MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB HE WAS TWENTY AND THE LIMIT WAS EIGHTEEN HE READ THE LETTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH MUCH INTEREST AND OFTEN HAD THOUGHT OF ANSWERING SOME OF THE REQUESTS FOR CORRESPONDENTS
6267-65525-0015 HE NEVER HAD DONE SO BUT ELLEN DOUGLAS'S LETTER WAS SO INTERESTING THAT THEY HAD DECIDED TO WRITE TO HER
6267-65525-0016 WOULD SHE BE KING ENOUGH TO CORRESPOND WITH HIM THEN
6267-65525-0017 HE WAS TWO YEARS OUT FROM THE EAST AND HAD NOT YET FORGOTTEN TO BE HOMESICK AT ONCE
6267-65525-0018 SYDNEY LOOKED THE LETTER AND ANSWERED IT
6267-65525-0019 SHE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET JOHN LINCOLN NOR DID SHE WISH HIM TO DO SO
6267-65525-0020 IN THE CORRESPONDENCE ITSELF SHE FELT HER PLEASURE
6267-65525-0021 JOHN LINCOLN WROTE BREEZY ACCOUNTS OF RANGE LIFE AND ADVENTURES ON THE FAR WESTERN PLAINS SO ALIEN AND REMOTE FROM SNUG HUMDRUM PLANEFIELD LIFE THAT SYDNEY ALWAYS HAD THE SENSATION OF CROSSING THE GULF WHEN SHE OPENED A LETTER FROM THE BAR AND AS FOR SYDNEY'S OWN LETTER THIS IS THE WAY IT READ AS SHE WROTE IT
6267-65525-0022 THE EVERGREENS PANEFIELD DEAR MISTER LINCOLN
6267-65525-0023 I LOVE LIFE AND ITS BLOOM AND BRILLIANCY I LOVE MEETING NEW PEOPLE I LOVE THE RIPPLE OF MUSIC THE HUNT OF LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION
6267-65525-0024 THE MAN I HAD BEEN TALKING WITH WAS BOTH MOORE THE GREAT NOVELIST

6467-97061-0010 HAVE READY ALSO A FIERCE ELEPHANT SUITABLY EQUIPPED WHICH I SHALL MOUNT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WEDDING TO OVERTAKE MY ARMY IN MARCH AGAINST THE ENEMY AND AS I SET OUT I WILL MAKE THE ELEPHANT TRAMPLE THE LIFE OUT OF THAT CRIMMY
6467-97061-0011 WHILE HE STOOD THERE CALMLY AWAITING DEATH WHICH NOW SEEMED INEVITABLE HE SUDDENLY FELT HIS FEET FREE AND A BEAUTIFUL LIGHT APPEARED BEFORE HIM
6467-97061-0012 SHE HUMBLY BOWING DOWN SAID LET MY LORD PARDON HIS SERVANT FOR THE INJURY WHICH SHE HAS UNCONSCIOUSLY CAUSED YOU
6467-97061-0013 I AM AN APSYCHUS BORN FROM THE RAYS OF THE MOON
6467-97061-0014 ONE DAY AS I WAS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR WEARING A WHITE DRESS A SWAN MISTAKING ME FOR A LOTUS FLOWER ATTACK'D ME
6467-97061-0015 IN HIS ANGER HE CURSED ME SAYING O WICKED ONE FOR THAT OFFENSE YOU ARE CONDEMNED TO BE CHANGED INTO A PIECE OF UNCONSCIOUS METAL
6467-97061-0016 THE CHANGES TOOK PLACE IMMEDIATELY AND I FELL TO THE GROUND TURNED INTO A SILVER CHAIN
6467-97061-0017 ON HIS WAY HE SAW THE SILVER FETTLE DESCENDED TO THE GROUND PICKED IT UP AND CONTINUED HIS WAY
6467-97061-0018 THE SLAYER OF GENDRAVAMA HEARING THIS CAME OUT OF THE PALACE AND QUICKLY MOUNTING THE ELEPHANT WHO HELD DOWN HIS TRUNK TO RECEIVE THEM PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE PRINCE
6467-97061-0019 GREAT WAS THEIR MUTUAL ASTONISHMENT AND JOY WHEN THEY RECOGNISED EACH OTHER THE PRINCE EXCLAIMING IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
6467-97061-0020 IS IT REALLY YOU MY DEAR FRIEND APAHARA ALMAH WHO HAD DONE THIS DEED
6467-97061-0021 THROUGH THESE THEY FORCED THEIR WAY EMPLOYING WITH GOOD EFFECTS THE WEAPONS PLACED ON THE ELEPHANT FOR THE USE OF GEN DRAMA
6467-97061-0022 BEFORE HOWEVER THEY HAD GONE FAR THEY HEARD THE NOISE OF BATTLE TO A DISTANCE AND SAW THE SOLDIERS IN FRONT OF THEM SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS
6467-97061-0023 WE HAVE JUST NOW ENCOUNTERED AND UTTERLY DEFEATED THE ENEMY SO THAT THERE IS NO FEAR OF ANY FARTHER ASSISTANCE
6467-97061-0024 RAJAMAHANHA AGREED TO THIS
6599-38590-0000 WHATEVER HAND IT WAS THAT SHOT DOWN BOURBONS ROME AFTER HIS DEATH WAS PLUNDERED DEVASTATED AND RAVAGED BY A BRUTAL GREEDY LICENTIOUS AND FANATICAL SOLDIERY

6599-38590-0005 NAY SAID FRANCES I WILL NOT SUFFER HIM TO SPEAK TO ME BEFORE HE HAS GIVEN ME APPOINTMENT OF TIME AND SPACE
6599-38590-0006 GIVE IT ME OR RETURN IF THOU HAST COME
6599-38590-0007 I AM QUITE WILLING SAID THE KING LET HIM GET IT
6599-38590-0008 THE PIECE OF CAMBREY WAS CALLED THE LADY'S PIECE IN HONOUR OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO HAD NEGOTIATED IT THOUGH MORALLY DIFFERENT AND OF VERY UNEQUAL WORTH THEY BOTH HAD MINDS OF A RARE ORDER AND TRAINED TO RECOGNISE POLITICAL NECESSITIES AND NOT TO ATTEMPT ANY BUT IMPOSSIBLE SUCCESSES
6599-38590-0009 ALL THE GREAT POLITICAL ACTORS SEEMED HURRYING AWAY FROM THE STAGE AS IF A DRAMA WERE APPROACHING ITS END
6599-38591-0000 IN FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO AT THE BATTLE OF DRUG HE WAS AGED AND SO ILL THAT NONE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM ON HORSEBACK
6599-38591-0001 HE FULLY ARMED SAVE ONLY HIS HEAD ANSWERED HIM RIGHT WELL SIR THIS IS THE GREAT MEDICINE THAT HATH CURED ME FOR THE BATTLE WHICH IS TOWARD AND A PREPARING FOR THE HONOR OF GOD IN OUR CAMP
6599-38591-0002 THE LADY'S PEACE CONCLUDED AT CAMBRAI IN FIFTEEN THIRTY NINE LASTED UP TO FIFTEEN THIRTY SIX INCESSANTLY TROUBLED HOWEVER BY FAR FROM PACIFIC SYMPTOMS PROCEEDINGS AND PREPARATIONS
6599-38591-0003 AT LAST HE DECIDED UPON RESTING
6599-38591-0004 IT WAS GARCILASO DE LA VEGA THE PRINCE OF SPANISH POESY THE SPANISH PETRARCH ACCORDING TO HIS FELLOW COUNTRY MEN
6599-38591-0005 MONTMORENCY SIGNED A SINGULAR ONE FOR PIEDMA
6599-38591-0006 THEY ALL REPAIRED TOGETHER TO THE HOUSE PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND AFTER DINNER THE EMPEROR BEING TIRED LAY DOWN TO REST ON A COUCH QUEEN ELEANOR BEFORE LONG WENT AND TAPPED AT HIS DOOR AND SENT WORD TO THE KING THAT THE EMPEROR WAS ASLEEP
6599-38591-0007 FRANCEZ WITH THE CARDINAL DE LORRAINE AND THE CONSTABLE DE MONTMORENCY SOON ARRIVED
6599-38591-0008 ON ENTERING THE CHAMBER HE FOUND THE EMPEROR STILL LYING DOWN AND CHATTING WITH HIS SISTER THE QUEEN WHO WAS SEATED BESIDE HIM ON CHAIR
6599-38591-0009 YES YES SAID CHARLES I HAD MADE SUCH CHEER THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SLEEP IT OFF
6599-38591-0010 FRANCIS DID THE CONVERSE WITH ITS OWN COLLAR
6599-38591-0011 ONLY SEVEN OF THE STUDENTS REMAINED IN THE EMPEROR'S CHAMBER AND THERE THE TWO SOVEREIGNS CONVERSED FOR AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THEY MOVED TO THE HALL WHERE A SPLENDID SUPPER AWAITED THEM
6599-38591-0012 THE GIANTIS PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE ARE RECEIVED AT THEIR JOYOUS ACCESSION
6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DROPPED BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A DREADFUL SIGH
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRAL
6841-88291-0002 SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S SONL BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE MARMOUDA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDON CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE COWS WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE WILD GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DID GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS ARE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANCE
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASEWOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN WERE BUILDING A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED UPON THE WIDE GATE AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J H LAMPING IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE FENCE AND SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTING TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED ACROSS INTO ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODSON AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A YOUNG FISH
6841-88291-0013 HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SET OVER IT ONE STRIP TO AVOID THE TIGHTENED LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF HE
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULL DOGGERERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCE UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLUCKED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 THUS THE CAF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY WRONG
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULL DOGGUS
6841-88291-0021 THE MARKER YELLED THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BRANDER PRESSED HIS IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF BLATHERED A LITTLE LEST THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRANCO CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOR TO INDICATE DUE PEELING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOWTAIL AND THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDS
6841-88291-0027 UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT PAINFUL AND COULD NO OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADOPT IT IN PREFERENCE
6841-88291-0028 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THE SPREAD OF THIS DOCTRINE INTO ARIZONA
6841-88291-0029 IMAGINE A PUNCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TAGS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR AT A ROUNDUP
6841-88291-0030 A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEEDING OR THE LOOKING IDLY ABOUT
6841-88291-0031 BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT DENIED TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD OUR TEETH FIXED
6841-88291-0032 ONE OF THE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS BUT A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEGS BUT TOSSED HIS LOOP ABOUT ITS NECK
6841-88291-0033 MISTER FROST'S BULL CALF ALONE IN PICTORIAL PICTURE SHOWS THE ATTITUDES
6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERPUTABILITY OF THE HORSE AND RIDER
6841-88291-0035 AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HUNG
6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD CATCH HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE VIGOROUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING DOWN TO THE UPRIGHT
6841-88291-0037 YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAVE HAPPENED NEXT
6841-88291-0038 THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME FUN IF IT PLEASES
6841-88291-0039 BY NOW THE BRANDS WAS IN FULL SWING
6841-88291-0040 WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID THE CASTES FAIL
6841-88291-0041 MEN RAN TO AND FRO BUSY BUSY AND INTENT
6841-88291-0042 SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR COLVES WERE ON THE GROUND AT ONCE
6841-88291-0043 DUST AHEADIED AND DISSIPATED
6841-88291-0044 NO MORE NICK CALFS THEY ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0045 THEN SHE WOULD SPIT ON HIS HANDS AND GO AT IT ALONE
6841-88291-0046 IF LUCK ATTENDED A FIRST EFFORT HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND THERE'S YOUR LITTLE CALF SAID HE
6841-88291-0047 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THIS FAR WITH YOUR LITTLE ODE IRON
6841-88291-0048 TOWARD NOON THE WORK SLAWED
6841-88291-0049 FINALLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMAN AND REPORTED A BRANDON FINISHED
6841-88291-0050 THE LIGHT COUNTED THE MARKS IN HIS TALLY BOOK
6841-88291-0051 ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX HE EXAMINED
6841-88291-0052 THE MARKERS SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS TOLD ON THE BITS OF EARS THEY HAD SAVED
6841-88291-0053 THE TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT AN HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE
6841-88291-0054 FINALLY WOODENS DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HIP POCKET
6841-88291-0055 THEY HAD BEEN DOING A WRESTLER'S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNINGS BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED
6841-88291-0056 I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE A PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN'S AND THAT IT EXERCISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF THE BODY
6841-88294-0000 AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THE STORM ON THE ROOF CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EEVES
6841-88294-0001 WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKING OUT AT A POPULAR GATE I SAW THEM ALL
6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEEL THROUGH CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB OF MY LEFT LEG
6841-88294-0003 THEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD SHUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND
6841-88294-0004 IN A PLACE OF IT HE WORE A SHARP STEEL HOOK
6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHIN HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GITS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT WOULDN'T SOUND GOOD
6841-88294-0006 WHEN A MAN BREATHES THAT WAY HE'S MOST LIKELY ALL GONE
6841-88294-0007 MIN GOT BATTED OVER THE HEAD OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
6841-88294-0008 SOUR WINE IS FINE TO PUT A WOUND A SHAPE TO HEEL BUT IT'S NO SOOTHIN SYRUP
6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRAVE IT WAS THE SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEAS ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBAREE
6841-88294-0010 IT FAIR MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH A BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE IN THE QUIET MOONLIGHT AND THE SHADOWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZONING EACH SIDE HIS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER THE RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO GET HIM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AND PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT SLEEP
6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN HE'D SING THAT BARBERY SONG UNTIL I'D GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWIN BY JIST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DIED AND GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE'D JUST TALK
6841-88294-0013 HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND THEN HE GAVE HIS SIDE OF CONVERSATIONS PAUSING FOR REPLIES
6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THAT HOUR BUT I NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE'D COME FROM OR WHAT HE'D DONE
6841-88294-0015 I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HE WAS KIND
6841-88294-0016 USUALLY I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING A SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME RETURN
6841-88294-0017 HE WAS LYING ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS WERE BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES HE ASKED VERY INTENTLY
6841-88294-0019 ONE LITTLE SQUEEZE I TALK ABOUT YOUR DEADLY WEAPONS
6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'D BEEN TOO SICK AND TOO LONG AB BED
6841-88294-0021 IN A MINUTE OR SO HE WENT TO
6841-88294-0022 NOW YOU' ARE A NICE SWEET PROPOSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
6841-88294-0023 THEY'RE SAFE ENOUGH LET ME HAVE THEM HE EXCLAIMED
6841-88294-0024 NOW LOOK HERE SAID I YOU CAN'T GET UP TO DAY IT AIN'T FIT
6841-88294-0025 I KNOW NOT HE PLEADED BUT LET ME SEE THEM
6841-88294-0026 JUST TO SATISFY HIM I PASSED OVER HIS OTHER DUDS
6841-88294-0027 I'VE BEEN ROBBED SHE ANSWERED
6841-88294-0028 HOW'S MY COAT HE ASKED
6841-88294-0029 YOU GOT NO COAT WHEN I PICKED YOU UP I REPLIED
6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED AT ME MIGHTY SUSPICIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER IF I SPOKE TO HIM
6841-88294-0031 WHEN HE'D EATEN A FAIR MEAL HE FELL ASLEEP
6841-88294-0032 WHEN THEY CAME BACK THAT EVENING THE BUNK WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE
6841-88294-0033 I DOESN'T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR TWO DAYS
6841-88294-0034 THEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM QUITE A WAYS
6841-88294-0035 GUESS HE'S SUSPICIOUS I'D STOLE THAT OLD COAT OF HIS THINKS I AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT
6841-88294-0036 PROBABLY HE DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THAT FRAME OF MIND
6841-88294-0037 I RANG UP PULLING MY GUN
6841-88294-0038 THE MEX WAS FLAT ON ITS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
6841-88294-0039 ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK KNELT AN ONE ARMED FRIEND
6841-88294-0040 ANYWAY I THRUST THE MUZZLE OF MY COLT INTO THE SAILOR'S FACE WHAT'S HIS I ASKED
6841-88294-0041 I WEEN HIM ET MONTE OF ANTONIO KURVAZ SAID HE
6841-88294-0042 THE GLEAM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SNARL LIFTED THE LIPS
6841-88294-0043 IN ANY CASE WE FLEW POCO PRONTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
6841-88294-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOSTLY DOIN ODD JOBS I SAW IT OFF AND ON
6841-88294-0045 HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THE TIME ALMIGHTY BUSY HOLDING DOWN MY CARD GAMES
6841-88294-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YOU'D BETTER SAY RIGHT THERE
6841-88294-0047 I WANT TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR YOUR TRAVEL SAID HE
6841-88294-0048 WHAT KIND OF GOOD THINGS I ASKED TREASURE SAID HE
6841-88294-0049 HE LOOKED ALL RIGHT ENOUGH NEITHER DRUNK NOR LOCOE
6841-88294-0050 SIT DOWN SAID I OVER THERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STABLE
6841-88294-0051 SHE DID SO A FAR AWAY SAID I
6841-88294-0052 AND IT'S A BIG THING SAID HANDY SOLOMON TO ME FOR THEY'S NOT ONLY THE GOLD BUT ULTRA JEWELS AND DI'MONDS
6841-88294-0053 IT WILL MAKE US RICH AND A DOZEN LIKE US AND YOU CAN KISS THE BOOK ON THIS
6841-88294-0054 THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT WHY DO YOU CALL ME
6841-88294-0055 WHY DON'T YOU GET THEIR TREASURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF DIVIDING IT
6841-88294-0056 WHY THE MATE HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAIN GRATITUDE
6841-88294-0057 DIDN'T YOU SAVE MY LIFE AN NUSST ME AND TAKE CARE OF ME WHEN I WAS NOT KILLED
6841-88294-0058 LOOK HERE ANDERSON OR HANDY SOLOMON OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO CALL YOURSELF I REJOINED TO THIS IF YOU ARE GOIN TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK STRAIGHT
6841-88294-0059 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY GRATITUDE BUT THAT CAN'T GO WITH ME
6841-88294-0060 THE DEVIL'S A PREACHER IF YOU AIN'T LOST YOUR HEAD FEATHERS SAID HE
6841-88294-0061 WELL IT'S THIS THEN I GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GIT HERE AND SHE MUST BE STOCKED
6841-88294-0062 AND I HAVE GOT TO HAVE HELP WITH THE TREASURE IF IT'S LIKE THIS FELLOW SAID IT WAS
6841-88294-0063 IT'S MONEY I'VE GOT TO HAVE AND IT'S MONEY I HAVEN'T GOT AND CAN'T GET UNLESS I LETS SOME BODY IN AS PARDNER
6841-88294-0064 WHY MEBBE I ASKED WHY NOT HE RETORTED
6841-88294-0065 WE TOOK THE MATTER OVER AT LENGTH
6841-88294-0066 I WENT OUT FOR A LARGER PARTY
6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS AS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT THEY HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY WE COMPROMISED
6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THE TREASURE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SCHEME COULD NOT APPEAL TO HIM
700-122866-0000 JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE ENOUGH
700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL MONEY FOR EVERY DAY LIFE
700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARILLA DISAPPROVES OF THIS
700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE SENSIBLE REALLY
700-122866-0004 I JUST LAY AWAKE AND IMAGINED THE CONCERT OVER OR OVER AGAIN
700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTINGS
700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAMME AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE WE HAD TO DO PROPERLY
700-122866-0007 THE WINTER WEEKS SLIP BY IT
700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THE CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD SOON WRITE A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT
700-122866-0009 BUT I CAN SCARCELY REALIZE THAT I AM IN MY TEENS
700-122866-0010 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS EVEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT
700-122866-0011 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BEAUQUES SAID ANNE DISDAINFULLY
700-122866-0012 SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ANY ONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN AN TAKE NOTICE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
700-122866-0013 I'M TRYING TO BE AS GOOD LIKE MISSUS ALLEN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE'S PERFECT
700-122866-0014 IF I HAD ALICE BELL'S CROOKED NOSE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY I WOULDN'T BUT THERE IS
700-122866-0015 I'M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMPLEMENT ABOUT THIS LONG AGO
700-122866-0016 OH DIANA THINK THERE'S A RABBIT
700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING PRETTY BREATHS
700-122866-0018 I KNOW IT LAST MONDAY EVENING
700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR IN DEATHS NOT DIVIDED
700-122866-0020 I READ IT TO MARILLA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFFY NONSENSE
700-122866-0021 IT'S A SADLY SWEET STORY
700-122866-0022 CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORNET OF WHITE HAIR AND DUSKY FLASHING EYES
700-122866-0023 YOU KNOW NOT SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE
700-122866-0024 THEY GREW IN BEAUTY SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE STRIKING
700-122866-0025 I ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SONS MARRIED
700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FRIEND THE SAME AS EVER HE
700-122866-0027 LET'S YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CLUB ALL OUR OWN AND WRITE STORIES FOR PLEASURE
700-122866-0028 I OUGHT TO CULTIVATE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS STACY SAYS SO
700-122866-0029 ONLY WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT WAYS
700-122866-0030 THERE WAS HOW THE STORY CLUB CAME INTO EXISTENCE
700-122866-0031 NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MEMBER HAD TO CHOOSE ONE STORY A WEEK
700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO READ HER STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN WE TALK OVER
700-122866-0033 MINE IS ROSAMONDE MONTMOREGERIN ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
700-122866-0034 I' M SURE THAT MUST HAVE A WHOLESOME EFFECT
700-122866-0035 THE MORAL IS THIS GREAT THING MISTER ALLEN SAYS SO
700-122866-0036 I READ ONE OF YOUR STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLEN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MORAL WAS EXCELLENT
700-122866-0037 JANE AND RUBY ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC PART
700-122866-0038 MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAD EVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE
700-122866-0039 I'M SURE MISSUS ALLAN WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE CREATURE AS YOU ARE
700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I HEARD THAT IT
700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS HE ALWAYS FELT SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANY ONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE
700-122866-0042 NOW I DIDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
700-122867-0000 VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT THE
700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND MARILLA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL SADNESS
700-122867-0002 I MAY SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT OR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW
700-122867-0003 PERHAPS YOU'RE JUDGING HER TOO HASTILY MARILLAS
700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HER PART MATTHEW BUT I' AM BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU
700-122867-0005 DEMANDED MARILLA ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO A BED
700-122867-0006 ANNE COWERED DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOREVER FROM MORTAL EYES NO I
700-122867-0007 GET RIDE UP THIS MINUTE AND TELL ME
700-122867-0008 THIS MINUTE I SAY WHERE NOW WHAT IS IT
700-122867-0009 ANNE HAD SLID TO THE GROUND IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE
700-122867-0010 YES IT'S GREEN MOANED ANNEN
700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS RED FACE
700-122867-0012 YOU HADN'T GOTTEN INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR EVER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
700-122867-0013 OH THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR
700-122867-0014 AND SHIRLEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS WICKED THING TO DO
700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED ALICE
700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DAD FOR
700-122867-0017 AS MISSUS ALLEN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANY ONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT
700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T THEN AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID MOST IMPLICITLY
700-122867-0019 WHO HE SAID WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
700-122867-0020 YES I DIDN'T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE
700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE OH
700-122867-0022 OH MARILLA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTISES TO DECEIVE
700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY WE CAN'T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
700-122867-0024 WITH A DISMAL SIGH SHE WENT IN THE SCISSORS
700-122867-0025 BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT A DIRTY COLOUR IS THERE
700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO WEEP ALL THAT TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF IT WON'T INTERFERE
700-122867-0027 IT BECAME SUCH A TRAGIC THING
700-122867-0028 ANNE WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UP STAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASSES SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
700-122867-0029 YES I WILL SEE
700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT THEN I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURLING
700-122867-0031 I EXPECT EVERYTHING WILL HAPPEN TO MY NOSE NEXT
700-122867-0032 ANN'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO THEIR RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCARED SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I COULDN'T
700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T THAT
700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER HIS AND I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE MUCH
700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLEN AND MISS STACY AND GROW UP TO BE A CREDIT TO ME
700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHERE MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON ROUND MY HEAD WITH A BOW AT ONE SIDE
700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL IT A SNOOD THAT SOUNDED SO ROMANTIC
700-122867-0040 MY HAT IS BETTER NOW
700-122867-0041 IT WAS TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON THO
700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE ANNE ANSWERED DIANA
700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW THAT I DIDN'T KEEP STILL
700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A RED HEADED A ELAINE MOURNED ANNE
700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS A LILY GOD
700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU GET IT
700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER BARRY KEPT FOR DECK SHOOTING
700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANN'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATIZE ALAN
700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT ONE
700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING IN A LANE
700-122868-0009 THE BLACK SHELL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPED IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER CHEST
700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS'S HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
700-122868-0011 JANE OR ARRANGES
700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR LAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE'S DEAD
700-122868-0013 I JANE ROSE TO THE OCCASION
700-122868-0014 SHE LEFT BEHIND AT THE LANDING
700-122868-0015 JOHN GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
700-122868-0016 AND THERE IS ONE CHANCE JUST ONE
700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWER WITH PRAYER
700-122868-0018 THE LIGHT DRIFTED UNDER THE BRIDGE AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MID STREAM
700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NO DOUBT BUT THAT VAN HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY THEY SEEMING LIKE AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAID
700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHERE DID THE GIRLS GONE
700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES TO
700-122868-0023 AND SHURLEY
700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DOES YOU GET UP THERE HE EXCLAIMED
700-122868-0025 IT WAS ALSO EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
700-122868-0026 WHY WHAT HAS HAPPENED ANNE
700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING UP HIS OARS'
700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT AND THE BARGE I MEAN THE FLOT
700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT THEN HESITATED
700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK QUEER A LITTLE BEAT
700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND YOUNGER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WISH TO BE
700-122868-0033 ALL RIGHTS
700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNE SHIRLEY AND YOU DON'T CARE EITHER
700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL NOW
700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS AND TO ESCAPE
700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO BELIEVE
700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANNE GROANED ROSA
700-122868-0039 I DON'T SAY HOW SAID MONSIEUR
700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF SOME VERY SHORTCOMING
7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YE NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IPSOPHYLICIDAS SE NISCITEMPERAT PREMITE EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAYS THAT SOME GODS TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND TO CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE IS SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREMES OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMONER AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THE SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS
7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIVES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR THE GREATER WEIGHT
7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLES AND SENT THEM TO COMBAT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAIN WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE
7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE ILLS OF A LONG PIECE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN THE WAR
7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF HIGH YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PAY
7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSE TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT PLEASURE TO FED WITH BLOOD
7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE HONOURS DELAYED IN THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
7601-101622-0005 LET BEAST'S BLOOD STAIN THE INFAMOUS ARENA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ARTED
7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND TO DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RAISING THEIR DEATH
7601-101622-0007 THE VERY ANIMALS THEMSELVES SET THEM ON
7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING OF REVOLT'
7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARDS THE FORWARD
7601-175351-0002 YOU LIGHT THE FIRES EXCLAIMED SOME
7601-175351-0003 WHAT WITH I ASKED OTHERS
7601-175351-0004 AND STUFFED THE STOVE WITH THE BASTS ADDED WARREN
7601-175351-0005 DID YOU THINK ME
7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE UP CRIED HATTERAS
7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PENN ADVANCING TOWARD THE CABIN
7601-175351-0008 I SAY SAID PENN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FURTHER
7601-175351-0009 YOU SHA'N'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN A WINTER AND THEY SHA'N'T LIGHT THE FIRES
7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP INTO YOUR CABIN AND GUARDED
7601-175351-0011 A MURMUR WAS HEARD WHAT
7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOVER AND WARREEN WENT DOWN TO HIS POST
7601-175351-0013 AND STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERED AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROW
7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BERING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELD THE STREAMS CROWDED TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
7601-175351-0015 I'M BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WAR
7601-175351-0016 HATTERAS HAD STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
7601-175351-0017 AND OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS AS APOCRYPHAL
7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS COVERED THE SKY
7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK BRAVING THE COLD THE SAND AND THE SNOW
7601-175351-0021 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO IMITATE ME I THINK
7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAWBONNY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT WAS TO BE FOUND
7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED WHEN
7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WILL MISTER CLAWBODY
7601-175351-0025 I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE TEN
7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRINNELLE LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITANNIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARDMOST WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCYDIDES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HINTS WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE A FAVORITE THAT THE PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE THREE SUBJECTS FOR THE HISTORIC PEN
7601-291468-0002 THE FALLS OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
7601-291468-0003 ALSO THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES
7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AND APOTHEGMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SPOLIA OPIM
7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED WITH GRATUS
7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY AND COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHERCOCKS THAT TURNED AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONGHEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN THE KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIVES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
7641-96252-0000 THUS THEN DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS STILL THE SAME
7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE THAT BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED THROUGH DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM AND
7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE HILLS AND ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN A LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE TAKE THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BLONDS TO A FLEETING AND ELUSIVE SPECIMEN
7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS WILLS IN EVERY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFERER
7641-96252-0008 BUT THE LATTER IS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE SYMPATHY OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITES OF THE STAIN OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN A WORLD OF FAMILY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND CERTAINLY DOES NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL ONE YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SERENITY OF DISPOSITION
7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IT IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE
7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALIZE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PECULIAR INDIVIDUALS CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NOUGHT OR LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETERNALLY FREE
7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT LOOK FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERRING THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR A LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTWEIGH THE REGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SOCRATES AND GIORDANO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTH SUFFERING DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HAND OF THE PRIEST
7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES FOR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE
7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPACITY FOR LOVES AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON IMAGINATION
7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS THING HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS SIGHT THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN I WISH FOR DELIVERANCE
7641-96670-0000 THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOONLIGHT HAD COME INTO THE SKY
7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SESASTRAS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF AHA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN HER RISING AND SETTING
7641-96670-0002 MEDIA TOO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS THOUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF CRETHEUS AND CROTHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMIS THEIR GRANDFATHER
7641-96670-0004 JASON TOOK PELIAS AND TELAMIN WITH HIM
7641-96670-0005 AS WE CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHRIXUS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
7641-96670-0006 THE MIST HAD LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PALACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KENEIDUS LIVED WITH OBSYRTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDEIA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS
7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE HAWK AND MEDIA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THE PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE CASSUS
7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF A HEROES OF GREECE
7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SARAMATOI
7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM OF YOU
7641-96670-0013 ADA'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S
7641-96670-0014 AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID A
7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DECIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE LORDS
7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL WITH YOU
7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE MOVED AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRAIGHT BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
7641-96670-0020 KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF IRAS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS
7641-96670-0021 WHEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON
7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE
7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FOR MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS HEAD UPON THE GROUND
7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS FAST AS IT IS
7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDEA GROWING WIDE AS WITH FEAR
7641-96670-0027 PHRONTAS AND MELLUS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
7641-96684-0000 AND AS A MOTOR APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT FORM
7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER ADMEEDUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS FOR ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT BEAUTY
7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE OH APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMMETUS
7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT GRACE
7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING IN ADMETUS
7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU SHALL NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS AD MENDIS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
7641-96684-0011 IF MAN WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO WALLS
7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD AT FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR
7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND COME WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMEN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
7641-96684-0016 ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AS HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
7641-96684-0017 THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THAT BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU WERE THE KEEN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
7641-96684-0019 NOW THE FOOTSTEPS APPEARED TO STOP
7641-96684-0020 IT WAS NOT SO DANGEROUS FOR HIM AS BEFORE
7641-96684-0021 AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAVE BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR SHE
7641-96684-0023 NOW NOT HERE FOR YE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE
7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THEIR BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
7641-96684-0025 NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM US
7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THAT BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD IS TO SACRIFICE DUE
7641-96684-0028 AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER THING WAS BEFORE HIM
7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDER WORLD
7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH THE DEATH
7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THEME IT COULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
7641-96684-0032 HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND WE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU SHALL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GUARD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS NOT VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FOR AN ENEMY
7641-96684-0037 THIS I CAN'T DO SAID ADMETUS I'VE HAD PAINS ENOUGH
7641-96684-0038 THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS EYES
7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE SAID TWO OR THREE TIMES
7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE DEAD MAN OF THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT SIRION
7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE I WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG ROUND HIS HEAD
7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIANY WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MASTER TO SWEEP IT
7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANING THIS
7697-105815-0008 THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COMING IN TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEMED MADE CLEAN AND LAID IT LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAUS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOWN WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT WANDS CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED FRANCE BLESSED TOMB
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL THEY CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO WE COME
7697-105815-0014 FROM MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZAIN FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 NO YOU'RE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG AGE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THEY NO COUNT OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE'RE TAKING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ARTS
7697-105815-0019 IS NOT OUR CARE AS GOOD AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHENCE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN THE CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAKE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMORU SAID THAT TSAYING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE SAW THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEOPLE
7697-105815-0026 HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NEITHER
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM A GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW
7697-105815-0028 OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHILO HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THESE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SLEEP
7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE GONE ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN THE CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HATH GOT BACK HIS SCROB
7697-105815-0033 THEY LAID IT UP IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAMB THE SEA
7697-105815-0035 AH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRINGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW COULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HAULT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THESE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH FOR NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN A GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE A WATCHFUL DWELT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS AND MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFALL TOLD HER WHY QUESTION HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT BACK HIS HEAD AND WENT WITHIN TO THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0043 HEYE COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT THEY SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MONTHIALL
7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND YET I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD
7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I THINK
7697-105815-0048 CHARITY AND WHY SHOULD YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LIKE THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALKS WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAYING AND THE STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND AND SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANUIS LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS SUBJECT
7697-105817-0001 AND JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KING'S SPOKE THUS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO FIND THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID CHRISTINA LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE FEEL
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE KEPT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 THE HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD
7697-105817-0008 A CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SAID DRY IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THAT GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY BUT THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FORD
7697-105817-0011 AND BY THIS ACT WE CURE OUR MINDS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THEIR STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MEN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DISBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWEVER GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THEIR SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MEN AND OF OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IT IS PART IS PAID IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 AND THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THIS REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LAID THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BED MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THESE SAFE INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATE MAN IN HIS STATE OF INNOCENCE
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEANIA OVER PLANS
7697-245712-0013 NOW HERE MEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNIONI HAVE BEEN STERILE
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITYES
7697-245712-0016 INEQUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERPIECE IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP SHOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF AN AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY ANY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 HOWEVER IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR A DEBT I SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESSLY
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED STOUTLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON ME
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENSE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY TO HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CANNOT INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE WE COULD SAY ANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO RUDELY TO ME SHE ASKED
8173-294714-0008 YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL THEIRS
8173-294714-0009 WHAT WRONG ARE YOU TALKIN OF
8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME OF A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL
8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAVE MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS FOR IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND WIFE I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD PRIDE SHE SAID
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MY OWN
8173-294714-0016 A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND IN A PRISON FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YE FOR MY FOOD AND SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FAMILY OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED ON
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT NOT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY POSITION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS IN STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 OF WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF YOU
8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED AND SPOKE OF IT NO LESS
8173-294714-0026 AND EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE I HOPELESS INFATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU WILL HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESERVE ALL TO BE FORGIVEN
8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO SEE YOUR ONLY FRIEND
8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY WHETHER I CAN HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ADDED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH
8173-294714-0033 MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF A LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU THINK
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT
8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF YOU AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY WHY NEED YOU HESITATE
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO REVENGE YOUR ANXIETIES
8173-294714-0039 HAVE NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS COMING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 NOW THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED BY THOSE FOUR WORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SMALL WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS

8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
8254-115543-0001 EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF CONTRARY WORDS
8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING AND ESCORTING THE SERVANT AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON
8254-115543-0003 THEY WAS QUITE A PROCESSION WHEN AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY
8254-115543-0004 BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER IN HER DOLLY DUCK A SORT OF LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SOWN BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES
8254-115543-0005 BESIDES THAT FAMILY THERE WERE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THE SLOW MOVING WAGON
8254-115543-0006 THE CLOCK TOO WENT WITH THEM
8254-115543-0007 GOOD BY SHOUTED LITTLE KNALL FROM HIS GARDEN WHILES THEY WENT BY GOOD BYE
8254-115543-0008 THEY SHOUTED GREETINGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE POTTER AS THEY PASSED HIM AND ALSO TO THE OLD FAKIR SMEARED ALL OVER WITH ASHES WHO SAT IN A LITTLE BRICK HUT BY THE BRIDGE AND PRETENDED TO MAKE BEAUTIFUL CURES
8254-115543-0009 THIS IS MORE FUN THAN GOING TO SCHOOL SAID SICOLA AS THE OXEN PLODDED ALONG THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
8254-115543-0010 THESE LOVELY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND AND IN SOME PARTS RUN QUITE WILD
8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MATTED HEAD HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS
8254-115543-0012 AS THE WAGONS CAME UP A YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THE HOLY MAN RAN UP AND HELD OUT A BEGGING BOWL SAYING GIVE O CHARITABLE PEOPLE TO THIS HOLY ONE
8254-115543-0013 NO COUNTY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MANY BEGGARS AS INDIA
8254-115543-0014 MANY OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN
8254-115543-0015 WHILE THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEAR THEM
8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THEY ARE DOGS SAID MAHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CANES DOWN BY A STREAM
8254-115543-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN BUY SOME FROM THE MAN THERE HE IS NOW PLOWING BY A STREAM SAID COLLA
8254-115543-0018 IT'S LOOKING FOR WATER SAID THE FARMER AS HE TOOK A LAST STOCK OF CANE AND GENTLY GUIDED IT DOWN TO THE STREAM
8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS THE SACRED ANIMAL OF THE HINDOOS AND THEY WILL NOT KILL OR INJURE ONE FOR ANYTHING
8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN I SAW A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD
8254-115543-0021 IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING IN STATE ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJA OR RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MODERN INDIA WAS FAMILIARLY MADE UP
8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT ALL DECORATED WITH SILK AND GOLD AND
8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS THE HOWDAH WHICH WAS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS THE RAJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLOURED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUMES IN HIS TURBAN
8254-115543-0024 BEHIND THE HOWDAH STOOD A SERVANT HOLDING A BIG UMBRELLA OF FINE FEATHERS OVER THIS RAJAH'S HEAD
8254-115543-0025 THE DRIVER SAT ON THE NECK OF THE ELEPHANT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST BY PRODDING HIM ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN IRON SHOD STICK OR A GOAD
8254-115543-0026 DOESN'T IT FINE TO RIDE LIKE THAT ON A BIG ELEPHANT
8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF THE NIGHT THE LITTLE FOLK TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE GREAT RAJA AND HIS ESCORT
8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING ABOUT ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS AND BARGAINING FOR FOOD AT THE LITTLE BOOTH
8254-115543-0029 THESE THEY USED FOR PLATES HEAPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICE AND CURRY AND FISH AND ALL SORTS OF PUDDINGS IN SWEETS
8254-115543-0030 A SUPPER WAS BEING EATEN ANOTHER PARTY STOPPED AT THE PALRAL ENCAMPED NOT FAR AWAY
8254-115543-0031 WHEN THE LITTER WAS PUT DOWN A YOUNG LAWYER STEPPED OUT LOOKING VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY
8254-115543-0032 HIS SERVANTS AT ONCE SPREAD A HANDSOME RUG ON THE GROUND FOR HIM TO SIT ON AND RUSHED ABOUT WAITING FOR HIM TAKING GOOD CARE TO KEEP EVERY ONE AT A DISTANCE
8254-115543-0033 YES AND HOW HE ORDERS ANYONE ABOUT HIM
8254-115543-0034 ROUND THE LITTLE BRAHMIN'S NECK WAS A THIN CORD OR THREAD WHICH WAS A SIGN OF HIS HIGH CASTE
8254-115543-0035 MEANWHILE THE HAUGHTY LITTLE BRAHMIN ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HIS HEAD TURNED AWAY SO NO ONE COULD SEE HIM EAT AND THEN GROWING TIRED OF RESPECTFUL GLANCES AT THE CROWD ROUND HIM HE GOT INTO HIS LITTER AGAIN AND THE SERVANTS FASTENED THE CURTAINS TIGHTLY ROUND HIM
8254-115543-0036 EVERYBODY SLEPT SOUNDLY IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE SERVANTS WAS BEATING A DRUM MOST OF THE NIGHT WHICH THEY REALLY BELIEVED WAS A WAY TO KEEP OFF THE EVIL SPIRITS
8254-115543-0037 WHY THE THIEVES HE CRIED
8254-115543-0038 THEY'S AS BAD AS THE BEGGARS
