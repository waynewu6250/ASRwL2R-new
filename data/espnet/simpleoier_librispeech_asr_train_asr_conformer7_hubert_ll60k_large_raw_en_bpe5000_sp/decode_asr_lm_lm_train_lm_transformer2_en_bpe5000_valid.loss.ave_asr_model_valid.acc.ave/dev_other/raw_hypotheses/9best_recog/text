116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD THE BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN HAPPY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NICE BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE NOTICED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SLOWLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAYS TO MY FRIENDLY GUIDE
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CONDUCT THE WORSHIPS I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 THAT IDOL I WHISPERED TAKEN BY SURPRISE
116-288045-0007 HE WORSHIPPED GODS THAT DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAMORS IN MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 NO I SAID IN A SLOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 IT WAS AN IDOL THEN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 IT MADE ATHENS A CITY OF LIGHT IT CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD THEREFORE OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT INTERPOSED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANSWER COULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
116-288045-0014 PRODUCE THEM
116-288045-0015 I WONDERED TO MYSELF WHAT BLASPHEMY
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY BRIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNING THE DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 WHAT DO YOU DOUBT HOMER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOMER INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLLO HAS NOT AN IDOL
116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD OR THE SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE THE VARIOUS LIGHTS IN IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MIEN OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT THE PEOPLE ARE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTHDAY OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 FORGET IT APOLLO HE SAID WITH A SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON WAS ONLY AN IDOL
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWERING HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN TURNED TOWARDS HIM
116-288045-0027 WILL YOU NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO ITS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO PRESS HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF A IDOL AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT WAS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CANDED DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN A MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY GIVE FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT WAS WORTHY OF FAITH
116-288046-0003 WHEN I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE IS NOT BUILT UP IT IS ANOTHER CRITICISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHOR OR PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTH IN THE JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF THE STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRINNAL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RITES POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM IS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WISH I COULD TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 BUT FIRST LET US BE IMPERSONAL THE EPITHETS IRREVERENT BLASPHEMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG AT A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM PITY
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WITTING THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEI HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST ANIMATED BY THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BY CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 A MYTH IS A FANCIIAL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
116-288047-0001 THE MIND CRAVES FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN INBORNED DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO STAMP AT EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS MYTHOS THE PRIMITIVE MAN WAS SATISFIED UNTIL HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED ITS INADEQUACY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALIZATION
116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN INDIA HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE HINDUS
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MY VISITS HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 WAS JESUS A MYTH
116-288047-0007 HERE IS IN MAN A FACULTY FOR FICTION
116-288047-0008 THAT THINKS LESS THAN IT GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS A REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BIT INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURBING ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RELENTLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FILL THE SPACE ABOUT AND ABOVE US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE AND AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 WE COVET THE RAINBOW WE REACH THE MOON
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET DO NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH THIS FIRM GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN UNTIL MAN WAS MATURED
116-288047-0014 GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATE SURPRISE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL FAIRIES AND FACE OF MANKIND
116-288047-0016 HIS SCHOOL IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION AS THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILD
116-288047-0018 IN A DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTHPIECE AND NO MAN MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I COULD COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TO BE REASONABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE SERVANTS
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOUR OF HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DATES WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES AS THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPELS GAVE NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN IN THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 WHAT IS DISCREPANCY IN THE HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HORRID FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS OF JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 THOUGH IT IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THEIR CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN AND THE ZODIAC AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THIS PAGAN AUSTRALIA HAS BECOME THE CHRISTIAN EASTER
116-288048-0008 BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE OREGEN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SCEPTICAL CELSIS ONE
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MYTHS OF JESUS
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON OTHER HAND AS MYSTICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW WHO WAS FRANK
116-288048-0012 WHO WERE YOUNG PETER JUDAS AND MARY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THEY EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER NEVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE THEN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MYTH
116-288048-0016 WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STATE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF THAT TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 THEY HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 HOW ELSE IS THAT UNANIMOUS SCIENCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN WERE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONOURS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES
116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NOT FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BY THE SWORD NOW AND BY HELL FIRE HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST AWFUL UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JUDAS MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JUSTICE COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS WOULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 HAVE HIS PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF DELUDED PROFITS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAD PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROBLEMS
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH THE PREACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARRIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THAT PROMISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YOU ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WAS NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 COULD HE NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NO PRAYER IS A REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES OF AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR METEOR AND MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE EARTH BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 THE INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED TO THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL IT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH HIDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKE ALOUD ONE
1255-138279-0008 FOUR THREE
1255-138279-0009 THREE FIVE
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHADE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE BOAT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIRST WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RISES MIDDLE AND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL
1255-138279-0014 THAT WINDOW WAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THAT WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLURRED SPOTS IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I HAVE ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
1255-138279-0018 WELL I SAYS THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 SO MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 WE HAVE MONEY
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVED IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WHAT THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF YOU SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL
1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ANSWER
1255-138279-0024 GOOD NIGHT MARY GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 AND THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNCIL NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE REPLIED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND WOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE BOY BEGGED FOR SOME DELAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE SETTLED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IN HIM WOULD BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
1255-74899-0007 IF HE WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR LOVELL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THERE ARE POLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY OUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THAT COUNTRY IS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MASTERS
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATION AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MOST WATER BOIL MISTER THWAITE SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT A SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU MUST GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN I LASS ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT ON EARLY IN THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I'D SOONER SEE YOU DARN MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEETHEARTS
1255-74899-0021 I DO THAT TOO
1255-74899-0022 AND NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE THE LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HOPED SOMETHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
1255-90407-0001 AND AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE REMARKED
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WELL I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 NO BUT YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
1255-90407-0005 I MUST THINK SO
1255-90407-0006 HE'S MY BROTHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF THE SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER'S IS BUT A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BETTER ONE IF HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOUVE HEARD SIR
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL YOU MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 YOUR FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 WAS THAT THAT EVENING
1255-90407-0014 THERE UPON THE NETS THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPETS
1255-90407-0016 NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSES OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS THE ISLAND STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAVE NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW
1255-90407-0020 HE STEADIED HER HEAVILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED ABOUT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD UNDER THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS YET IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU BACK SOMETHING TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE LOOKED RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPY MY DEAR SAID PEARSON
1255-90407-0028 HE AGAIN BECOME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAS GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AYS CARROW
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS IT CLOSE AND SATISFIES
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINEAVON'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 SO THIS WAS NOT ALL
1255-90413-0004 BUT WAS HE READY
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HIM EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE RETURNED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 HE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY WELL POOL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS THOUGH SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD HEIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY
1255-90413-0011 SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I'VE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES THOUGH NEVER
1255-90413-0014 WHAT A UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 THIS IS RATHER UNCIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT IF HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANLECLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSCELYN PIERKIN
1255-90413-0019 OR DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINEOVAN WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE IN LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY ARRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICCOLA PINE HAVEN
1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN HER FIRST ARRIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THEIR TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE EXPRESSION IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANIONS ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME PLACE IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF A INVENTOR IS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESS OR COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OR MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOUR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGIS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD AND IT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THEIR ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A WHOLE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN HEARTENING FAST
1585-131718-0007 YES THE VERY VOGUA OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR STREET LINING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDING FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED CAN BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES AND LEADING CITIES
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION OF THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO A MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCLATE BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN IS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FROM ITS ENEMIES
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF CITIES THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROVINCES ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS TENDENCY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OBLIGATION OF WHICH THERE WERE PLENTY
1585-131718-0020 FOR IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE THE GENIAL INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM IN THE BALLASTON WATTGAGE
1585-131718-0023 AND SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT INTO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WERE THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLUE HOW TO IT
1585-131718-0027 I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE THAT DID THE WORK NICELY
1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO ADDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING THE CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOLF STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE THE PARADES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WORCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMBERLESS OTHER DETAILS
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTRO LIGHT COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS
1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCIAL
1585-131718-0033 THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE LATTER GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING THE RANT
1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY WAS A VERITABLE BEE HIVE DAY AND NIGHT
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARDNACLET OF THE CLOCK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED EM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGORS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND ALL PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT
1585-131718-0040 I SAW NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
1585-131718-0041 I WOULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO GIVE NOTICE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMONEY
1585-131718-0044 HE WOULD TALK WITH ME AND I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN
1585-131718-0045 ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH A VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLIN'S
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRESIDE
1585-131718-0048 HE WOULD GO ABOUT AMONG THE FIRE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLS DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAMB FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS OUTING FIRST
1585-131718-0051 I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE CODE
1585-131718-0052 THEN I GOT PLEURACY AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF DOUBTING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 AND NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
1585-157660-0000 LONDON HAS GOLD AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MEN ARE MOANED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE OLD STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAMS STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UTTERED THE FALLING ORRITORICAL FLIGHT
1585-157660-0003 GLORIOUS SUNDAY
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WONDERFUL ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF A WHARF BAT AND BEATEN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THE DOWNING COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERING AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE UNFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THE SUN RISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXPECTATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPORTATION FOULTS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST EE PROMISES AND OFT HE HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLITS
1585-157660-0009 DUSIS ONE DUBIL WHEN SIX IS TREBACOY
1585-157660-0010 WILLEM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CERNOPOT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION
1585-157660-0011 THE POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SO TAKE A WORD FOR IT
1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON A CASTE AND WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT PEW PAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD DROPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCO
1585-157660-0015 THE PREENOUS SHOP OF FOWL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVERN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES BURRIBRIDGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS ROUGH MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA IS BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE WEST
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HAND
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THAT VAST
1630-102884-0004 THE NATIONALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES THIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE YOU ACQUIRED A TRUE LOVE OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT EPOCH OF THE SOUL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHABIDA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS STIRRED IN HER COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HARDENED INTO AN AIR OF INERT CONSTRUCTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ODOR WHICH PRODUCED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY'RE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR VITAL FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 BY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GRIP OF AN INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE IN GROWTH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING CELLS INTO A PERMANENT PASSIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEIR OWN INTRINSIC DESIGNS AND OF MASTERING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALISE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING OUR STEPS FOR AGES CANNOT BE THE MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND OF FIGHTING AND FREEDOM'S CAUSE
1630-102884-0016 IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF INERTIA WHICH IS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUTH AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY BOTH WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND OUTSIDE
1630-141772-0000 ON THE PRATZEN HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAGSTAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND CHILD LIKE MOAN
1630-141772-0001 SUDDENLY HE AGAIN FELT THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BURNING LACERATED PAIN IN HIS HEAD
1630-141772-0002 WAS MY FIRST THOUGHT
1630-141772-0003 HE FEEBLY MOVED HIS LEG AND UTTERED A DEEP SICKLY GROAN WHICH AROUSED HIS OWN PITY
1630-141772-0004 LIFT THIS YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATIONS
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TERRIBLE PAIN OF BEING LIFTED ON TO THE STRETCHER THE JOLTING WHILE BEING MOOED AND THE PROBING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0006 DURING THIS TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND THEN SPEAK
1630-141772-0007 I ASKED ON SEEING THE PRISONERS
1630-141772-0008 I COMMANDED AS SQUADRON REPLIED REPIN
1630-141772-0009 PRINCE REPNON NAMED LIEUTENANT SUCTELLN
1630-141772-0010 AFTER LOOKING AT HIS NAPOLEON SMILED
1630-141772-0011 YOUTH IS NO HINDRANCE TO COURAGE MUTTERED SUCTILINE IN A FAILING VOICE
1630-141772-0012 A SPLENDID CRY SAID NAPOLEON
1630-141772-0013 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYES TO COMPLETE THE CHANGE OF PRISONERS COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHONE WITH SELF SATISFACTION AND DESIRE
1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD ICORN PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE PLEASURE THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY NOW HASTENED TO RETURN THE HOLY IMAGE
1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED BUT THE LITTLE ICON WITH HIS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT UD BE TO KNOW WHERE TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEHIND THE GRAVE
1630-141772-0018 HOW HAPPY AND CALM I SHOULD BE IF I COULD NOW SAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON ME
1630-141772-0019 EITHER TO A POWER INDEFINABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHICH I NOT ONLY CANNOT EXPRESS BUT WHICH I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS IN WORDS THE GREAT ALL OR NOTHING SAID HE TO HIMSELF OR TO THAT GOD WHO HAS BEEN SOWN INTO THIS AMULET BY MARY
1630-141772-0020 THE RESTERS MOVED ON
1630-141772-0021 THE QUIET HOME LIFE AND PEACEFUL HAPPINESS OF BALL HILLS PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM
1630-141772-0022 HERE IS A NERVOUS BILIOUS SUBJECT SAID LARRY AND WILL NOT RECOVER
1630-73710-0000 IT IS AT THE FOOT OF WOMAN THAT WE LAY THE LAURELS THAT WITHOUT HER SMILE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GAINED IT IS HER IMAGE THAT STRINGS THE LYRE OF THE POET THAT ANIMATES OUR VOICE IN THE BLAZE OF ELOQUENT FACTION AND GUIDES OUR BRAIN IN THE AUGUST TOILS OF STATELY COUNCILS
1630-73710-0001 IS THERE NO HOPES FOR THEM SO FULL OF HOPE
1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE SO TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO THE IMAGINATION
1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCUR FLITS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OBSCURING ALL OUR GAY FANCIES WITH ITS BAT LIKE WING AND TAINTING THE HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF THE HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPIRATIONS
1630-73710-0004 AND MINE OWN
1630-73710-0005 WELL DEAD WHAT COULD YOU DO
1630-73710-0006 I BET ABOUT MY FINGER LIKE A FILLY BIRD IN A CAGE
1630-73710-0007 DID NOT THINK OF MOVING TO DAY
1630-73710-0008 DO NOT KEEP THIS MESSENGER AN INSTANT
1630-73710-0009 CURSE ON MY PONY
1630-73710-0010 WRITE ONLY ONE WORD TO MY OWN HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0011 FERUDNANT TO HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0012 GOD BLESS YOU MY HENRIETTA MY BELOVED MY MATCHLESS HENRIET
1630-73710-0013 HAS THAT SEPARATION NOT COST ME
1630-73710-0014 PANGS THAT I COULD NOT CONCEIVE OF ANY HUMAN MISERY COULD OCCASION
1630-73710-0015 AND YET I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT SHE WAS UNINJURED LAST NIGHT
1630-73710-0016 I DARE NOT NOW TO OWN HOW FOOLISH I WAS
1630-73710-0017 DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOU HENRIETTA BUT I'M NERVOUS ABOUT CONCEALING OUR ENGAGEMENTS FROM PAPA
1630-73710-0018 DAYS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE YOU CAN REACH BATH AND I KNOW FERDINAND I KNOW OUR OFFICE IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WILL CONFESS
1630-73710-0019 BUT COME BACK MY OWN AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND WRITE TO ME AT THE POST OFFICE WHEN YOU'RE SETTLED
1630-73710-0020 THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YOU ARE SO NEAR MADE ME RESTLESS
1630-73710-0021 I WISH TO TREAT HIM WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS AS I CAN COMMAND
1630-96099-0000 THAT YOU SIR YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERTAKE
1630-96099-0001 WHEN SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HE HAS SOME SPECIAL INFORMATION SOME GREAT NEWS
1630-96099-0002 WHEN BLOK APPEARED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH HIM
1630-96099-0003 GONE NOW JUST WHERE WE MOST WARNED HIM NEVER
1630-96099-0004 ETIATE TRIPLE ETIAT
1630-96099-0005 YOU SHALL BE DISMISSED DISCHARGED FROM THE CSAR YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE FORCE
1630-96099-0006 IT IS THAT O YOU GREAT GLUTTONY
1630-96099-0007 MY CAPTAIN MADE HIMSELF MOST PLEASANT
1630-96099-0008 WELL AT ANY RATE FOR MY SINS I ACCEPTED IT
1630-96099-0009 WE ENTERED THE FIRST RESTAURANT THAT OF THE REUNITED TRENTS YOU KNEW IT PERHAPS
1630-96099-0010 I HAD NO FEAR OF HIM NOW TILL THE VERY LAST WHEN HE PLAYED ME THIS EVIL TURN
1630-96099-0011 I SUSPECTED NOTHING WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT HIS POCKET BOOK IT WAS STUFFED FULL MESSIEURS I SAW THAT AND MY CONFERENCE INCREASED CALLED FOR THE RECKONING AND PAID WITH AN ITALIAN BANK NOTE
1630-96099-0012 EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT DEAR
1630-96099-0013 HE WENT OUT MESSIA AND PIFFATH HE WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN
1630-96099-0014 WHY LET THEM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
1630-96099-0015 IT WAS ONLY NOW AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR THAT THE ITALIAN HAD BECOME INCULPATED AND THE QUESTION OF THIS POSSIBLE ANXIETY TO ESCAPE HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED
1630-96099-0016 HE LEFT NOTHING BEHIND
1630-96099-0017 HAND IT TO ME SAID THE CHIEF AND WHEN IT COME INTO HIS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES HURRIEDLY
1630-96099-0018 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT MORE THAN A WORD HERE AND THERE
1630-96099-0019 HE IS NO DOUBT ITALIAN
1630-96099-0020 OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WILL NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OR OF MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE
1630-96099-0021 IT WAS A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED LIRA A HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS HAH
1630-96099-0022 HE WAS MUCH PLEASED IN A GREAT HURRY
1630-96099-0023 DIRECTLY HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED BY DEVIL
1630-96099-0024 HE WANTED TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT THEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CAB AND WERE DRIVEN AWAY TOGETHER
1650-157641-0000 THIS SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARD SMOKING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER WAS CURIOUS
1650-157641-0001 NOW MISSUS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IN A SMOKING HUMOR AND SHOULD PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHT
1650-157641-0002 AND SEE WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU
1650-157641-0003 THE DWARF'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE
1650-157641-0004 BUT QUILPE AND BRASS WERE NOW IN SOCIETY
1650-157641-0005 THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE DEPONENTS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO
1650-157641-0006 ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THE GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATES SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR SMOKING AMONG THE OFFICERS OF THE ARMY
1650-157641-0007 THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ADOR OF TOBACCO AND THE DISTRUSTED THE MAN WHO SMOKED
1650-157641-0008 HERE IS FIDO'S OR THACKERAY'S COMMENTS ON IT WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
1650-157641-0009 I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT A WOMEN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RIVAL
1650-157641-0010 I WOULD LAY A GUINEA BUT THE MANLY LADY WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I'M A SMOKER AND SAYS OH THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE
1650-157641-0011 GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR THREESCORE YEARS PARIS SMOKES TO A MAN
1650-157641-0012 TSHAH LOOK AT HIS PROGRESS
1650-157641-0013 THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS NOW BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
1650-157641-0014 THE JOURNALISTS AND THE BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THEIR COGERS WERE ABOUT WERE BELOW THE THICK TASTE OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS
1650-157641-0015 BOTH QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE PRINCE CONSULOR DETESTED IT SO TOBACCO WAS TABOO WHEREVER THE COURT WAS
1650-167613-0000 THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT THE PRINCESS ANDREW APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA
1650-167613-0001 SEAS WERE BROUGHT IN AND SOIL WAS THIRTY
1650-167613-0002 THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT THE PEER'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF THE MALUSICOTE AND THE POSITION OF OUR ARMY ON WHICH HE HAD RIDDEN
1650-167613-0003 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS
1650-167613-0004 AND NOT BEING A MILITARY MAN YOU CAN'T SAY I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL POSITION
1650-167613-0005 WELL THEN YOU KNOW MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE BE IT WHAT IT MAY SAID PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0006 AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BARCLAY DE TOE
1650-167613-0007 PEER LOOKED AT MALCOLM WITH THE CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH EVERYBODY INVOLUNTARILY ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER
1650-167613-0008 WE SEE LIGHT AGAIN SINCE HIS SERENITY HAS BEEN APPOINTED YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID MAKING TIMIDLY AND CONTINUALLY TURNING TO GLANCE AT HIS COLONEL

1650-167613-0017 SKILFUL COMMANDER REPLIED A PEER
1650-167613-0018 PIERRE LOOKED AT THEM IN SURPRISE
1650-167613-0019 AND AND YET THEY SAY THAT THE WAR IS LIKE A GAME OF CHESS HE REMARKED
1650-167613-0020 THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE BODIES OF TROOP CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO ANY ONE
1650-167613-0021 SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ON NUMBERS AND LEAST OF ALL ON POSITION BUT ON WHAT THEN
1650-167613-0022 ON THE FEELING THAT IS IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMALKIN AND HE IS SOJER

1650-167613-0034 IN MY OPINION THEY ARE ALL CHRISTIANS

1650-167613-0036 SINCE THERE ARE MY FOES THEY CANNOT BE MY FRIENDS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SAID AT TUSIT
1650-167613-0037 YES YES MUTTERED MARY LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES AT THE PRINCE ANDREW

1650-167613-0041 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD FELT IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER OR NOT MASSACRO WAS TAKEN AS MALINSK HAD BEEN WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED IN HIS SPEECH BY AN UNEXPECTED CRAMMY HIS THROAT
1650-167613-0042 HE PACED UP AND DOWN A FEW TIME IN SILENCE BUT HIS EYES GLITTERED FEVERISHLY AND HIS LIPS QUIVERED AS HE BEGAN SPEAKING

1650-167613-0052 NO HE DO NOT WANT IT PIERRE CONCLUDED
1650-167613-0053 I KNEW THAT THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING
1650-167613-0054 ONE PICTURE SUCCEEDED ANOTHER TO HIS IMAGINATION
1650-167613-0055 ONE OF THEM HE DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY
1650-173551-0000 HIS MAJOR DOMO CAME IN A SECOND TIME TO SAY THAT THE FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THE LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND THAT SOME ONE FROM BEZZETEV'S WIDOW HAD A COW TO ASK PIERRE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOK AS SHE HERSELF WAS LEAVING FOR THE COUNTRY
1650-173551-0001 THERE WAS SOME ONE IN THE PASSAGE
1650-173551-0002 THE HAL PORTER WAS STANDING IN THE FRONT DOOR
1650-173551-0003 FROM THE LANDING WHERE PEER STOOD THERE WAS A SECOND STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE BACK ENTRANCE
1650-173551-0004 HE WENT DOWN THE STAIR CASE AND OUT INTO THE YARD NO ONE HAS SEEN HIM
1650-173551-0005 WHEN HE FELT THAT HE WAS BEING LOOKED AT HE BEHAVED LIKE AN OSTERBRIDGE WHICH HIDE HIS HEAD IN A BUSH IN ORDER TO BE SEEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND QUICKENING HIS PACE WENT DOWN THE STREET
1650-173551-0006 HE HIRED THE FIRST A CAB HE MET AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE PATRIARX'S POUNCE WHERE THE WIDOW BASITIVE'S HOUSE WAS
1650-173551-0007 THIS WAS THE AUTHENTIC SCOTCH ACTS WITH PATHATIVE'S NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS
1650-173551-0008 HE SAT DOWN AT THE DUSTY WRITING TABLE AND HAVING LAID THE MANUSCRIPT BEFORE HIM OPENED THEM OUT CLOSED THEM FINALLY PUSHED THEM AWAY AND RESTING HIS HEAD UPON HIS HAND SANK INTO MEDICATION
1650-173551-0009 MAKARY ALEXROVITCH CAME TWICE THAT EVENING SHUFFLING ALONG IN HIS SLASHES AS FAR AS THE DOOR AND STOPPED AND LOOKED INGRATIATEDLY AT PIERRE
1650-173552-0000 AT THAT VERY TIME AT TEN IN THE MORNING OF THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER NAPOLEON WAS STANDING AMONG HIS TROOPS ON THE PYRLONIA HILL LOOKING AT THE PANORAMAS SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM
1650-173552-0001 THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE EVENING WAS MAGICAL
1650-173552-0002 BUT A MY CLEMENCY IS ALWAYS READY TO DESCEND UPON THE VANQUISHED
1650-173552-0003 YET HERE SHE IS LYING AT MY FEET WITH HER GOLDEN DOMES AND CROSSES CINGULLATING IN A TWINKLING IN THE SUNSHINE
1650-173552-0004 THAT I SHALL SPARE HER
1650-173552-0005 FROM THE HIDE OF THE KREMELIN YES THE HERE IS THE KREMELIN YES I WILL GIVE THEM JUST A LOUSE I WILL TEACH THEM THE MEANING OF TRUE CIVILIZATION I WILL MAKE GENERATIONS OF BOYARS REMEMBER THEIR CONQUEROR WITH LAW
1650-173552-0006 I WILL TELL THE DEPUTATION THAT I DENOUNCE AND DO NOT DESIRE WAR THAT I WILL WAGE THE WAR ONLY AGAINST THE FALSE POLICY OF THEIR COURT THAT I LOVE AND RESPECT ALEXANDER AND THAT IN MASSACRE I WILL ACCEPT TERMS OF PEACE WORTHY OF MYSELF AND OF MY PEOPLE
1650-173552-0007 I DO NOT WISH TO UTILIZE THE FORTUNE OF WAR TO HUMILIATE AND HONOR THE MONARCH
1650-173552-0008 HE WILL HAVE TO BE TOLD ALL THE SAME SAYS SOME GENTLEMAN OF THIS SUITE BUT GENTLEMEN
1650-173552-0009 A SINGLE REPORT OF THE SICKENING GUN FOLLOWED AND THE TROOPS WHO WERE ALREADY SPREAD OUT ON DIFFERENT SIDES SOUTH MOSCOW MOVED INTO THE CITY THROUGH VERD KOLOUGA AND DARGOMALEVKA
1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER FOR WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED AND MAJESTIC TEACHER OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WISDOM
1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH HE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH HE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS PLAYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPERS I WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO NAME IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN AT NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED THE TITLE
1651-136854-0004 MADISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMBLED TOGETHER IN AS AWED A MANNER AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE EFFECT
1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS JOHNSON'S ABBREVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE END IS MENTIONED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE'S THE FOLLOWING SPECIMEN
1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF BAD HABITS NEGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED MY TIME
1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENCE OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING THE UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
1651-136854-0009 YOUTH AMBITIOUS OF THINKING HONORS EASY TO BE HAD
1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAINS PURSUED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCIFUL MANHOOD
1651-136854-0012 WHILE
1651-136854-0013 SCHOLAR'S FRIENDSHIP TO LADIES
1651-136854-0014 DRAWN A MAN BY WORDS REPELLED BY PASSIONS
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS AND THEY RETURN
1651-136854-0016 IT EQUALITY HINDERS COMPLIANCE
1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCES INSOLENCE AND ANGER
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD IN EITHER TO PRIVATE INTEREST TOO LITTLE
1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIORS EVERY MAN KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS AN AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN INTEREST
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED SCARCE EVEN WITHOUT CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IF THREE TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MANY AGAINST FIVE
1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO WRONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH A REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE THE MORE READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GUARD AND EXCITE AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUE
1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN USEFUL WISE AND INNOCENT AND A DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND HAPPY
1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENIES YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAS CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FAR FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 NOT THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANT OF STOICISM AS THE SUN OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENSES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRATES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABBLER TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT IN A LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITY IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTERWOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES DIFFER AS CLEAN CLOTH AND BROCADE
1686-142278-0000 HE HAD GONE
1686-142278-0001 NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES OR CRIMSON AND AMBER TINDS
1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY SKETCHING BEAUTIFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN
1686-142278-0003 HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF ITS BRIEF SUCCESS AND ALL THE SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECT OF HIS DESIRES OH DEAR
1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THE WORLD OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER
1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD HIS RESPONSES ALL TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0006 SHE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD NOT MADE THEM AN OFFER
1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF A LONG EVENING AND WISHING BEDTIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN
1686-142278-0008 NOW
1686-142278-0009 I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOME THING VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0010 VERY INTERESTING TO US ALL
1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER AFTER HER REFUSAL OR ELSE IT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
1686-142278-0012 AND SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER HAY DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THIS SIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0015 BUT WHY DEAR PA DO TELL ME
1686-142278-0016 BECAUSE I NO LONGER BE A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
1686-142278-0017 BUT NOTHING TO THE SHOCK HE RECEIVED FROM MISTER HALE'S LAST SPEECH WHAT COULD HE MEAN
1686-142278-0018 IT WAS ALL THE WORSE OF BEING SO MYSTERIOUS
1686-142278-0019 WHY CANNOT YOU NO LONGER BE A CLERGYMAN
1686-142278-0020 SURELY IF THE BISHOP ARE TOLD ALL WE KNOW ABOUT FREDERICK AND THE HARD AND JUST
1686-142278-0021 MARGARET I TELL YOU ABOUT IT
1686-142278-0022 I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS MOMENT BUT AFTER TO NIGHT LET US NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN
1686-142278-0023 I CAN METE OUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY PAINFUL MISERABLE DOUBTS BUT IT IS AN EFFORT BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING
1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION NOT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THIS HE PAUSED
1686-142278-0025 MARGARET STARTED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEW HORROR
1686-142278-0026 MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE OLD CHURCH FROM WHICH I AM TO BE SHUT OUT
1686-142278-0027 I COULD NOT GO ON FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
1686-142278-0028 MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WERE ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETAN
1686-142278-0029 THE ONE STAYED FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF THE BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING
1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN THE VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE CAUSE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW INVOLVED
1686-142278-0031 LISTEN DEAR MARY SAID HE PUTTING ONE ARM ROUND HER WAIST
1686-142278-0032 WHERE GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND YET HE WILL IN ANOTHER
1686-142278-0033 IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT NO ORDER TO A CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY
1686-142278-0034 AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT NOTHING MORE WHICH HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING
1686-142278-0035 I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACH WHICH WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MIND LESS TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE
1686-142278-0036 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS THEY WENT ON
1686-142278-0037 MARGARET I TRIED TO DO IT I TRIED TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THE ADDITIONAL PREFERMENT AND STOPPING QUIETLY THERE STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
1686-142278-0038 GOD FORGIVE
1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING LOW WORDS OF SELF REPROACH AND HUMILIATION WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT A FEW
1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD SAYING BURDEN WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE
1686-142278-0041 HERE
1686-142278-0042 I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP I DARESAY I HAVE TOLD YOU SO BUT I FORGET THINGS JUST NOW SAID MISTER HALE COLLAPSING INTO HIS DEPRESSED MANNER AS SOON AS HE CAME TO TALK OF A HARD MATTER OF FACT DETAILS INFORMING HIM OF MY INTENTION TO RESIGN THIS VICARAGE
1686-142278-0043 THEY ARE BUT WHAT I HAVE TRIED ON MYSELF WITHOUT A WAIL
1686-142278-0044 THAT WILL BE A TRIAL BUT WORSE FAR WORSE WILL BE DEPARTING FOR MY DEAR PEOPLE
1686-142278-0045 HE WILL COME TO STAY WITH US TO DAY

1686-142278-0050 PERHAPS AFTER ALL SHE IS NOT OH YES
1686-142278-0051 SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED AS THE FORCE OF THE BLOW RETURN UPON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALIZE HOW ANOTHER WOULD TAKE IT
1686-142278-0052 TO MERTON NORTHERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DULL INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENNESS OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER MIND
1686-142278-0053 WILTON NORTHERN
1686-142278-0054 OH YES SAID HE IN THE SAME DESPONDENT INDIFFERENT WAY
1686-142278-0055 BUT HE WITH THE QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ IN HER FACE AS IN A MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNED IT OFF WITH AN EFFORT
1686-142278-0056 YOU SHALL BE TOLD ON MARGARET
1686-142278-0057 ONLY HELP ME TO SEE YOUR MOTHER

1686-142278-0060 MARGARET DID DISLIKE IT DID SHRINK FROM IT MORE THAN FROM ANYTHING SHE HAD EVER HAD IN HER LIFE BEFORE
1686-142278-0061 MISTER HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDINGLY HE PRESSED A HAND IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
1686-142278-0062 MARGARET WAS NEARLY UPSET AGAIN AND A BURST OF CRYING
1686-142278-0063 TO LEARN HER THOUGHTS SHE SAID NOW TELL ME PAPA WHAT OUR PLANS ARE

1686-142278-0071 I CANNOT STAND OBSERVATIONS
1686-142278-0072 THESE MAKE ME SO UNDECIDED

1701-141760-0026 WHY HAD YOU THROWN THAT AWAY ASKED BORIS
1701-141760-0027 IT IS SOME LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT THE DEVIL DID I WANT IT FOR
1701-141760-0028 HE LOOKED INTENTLY AND INQUIRINGLY INTO HIS FRIEND'S EYES EVIDENTLY TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND THE ANSWERS TO SOME QUESTION
1701-141760-0029 WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT I WAS NOT AT ALL ALARMED CAUSE I KNEW I WAS RIGHT
1701-141760-0030 AS I CAME FORWARD BERG STOOD UP AND SHOWED HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR A FACE TO EXPRESS GREATER RESPECT AND SELF COMPLACENCY THAN HIS DID
1701-141760-0031 WELL HE STORMS AT ME AS THE SAYING IS STORMED AND STORMED AND STORMED
1701-141760-0032 IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF LIFE BUT RATHER OF DEATH AS A SAYING IS
1701-141760-0033 ALBANIANS AND DEVILS ARE TO SIBERIA SAID BERG WITH A SAGACIOUS SMILE
1701-141760-0034 I REMAINED SILENT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK COUNT

1701-141760-0036 THAT'S THE WAY COUNT SAYS BERG LIGHTING HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE
1701-141760-0037 WELL THAT WAS FINE SAID ROSTOV SMILING
1701-141760-0038 ROSTOV WAS A TRUTHFUL YOUNG MAN AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT HAVE TOLD A DELIBERATE LIES
1701-141760-0039 HE BEGAN HIS STORY MEANING TO TELL EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAPPENED AND IMPERCEPTIBLY INVOLUNTARILY AND INEVITABLY HE LAPSED INTO FALSEHOOD
1701-141760-0040 PRINCE ANDREW WHO LIKED TO HELP YOUNG MAN WAS FLATTERED BY BEING ASKED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE AND BEING WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS BORIS WHO HAD MANAGED TO PLEASE HIM THE DAY BEFORE HE WISHED TO DO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WANTED
1701-141760-0041 IN SPITE OF PRINCE ANDREW'S DISAGREEABLE IRONICAL TONE IN SPITE OF THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH ROSTOV FROM HIS FIGHTING PARTY POINT OF VIEW REGARDED ALL THESE LITTLE ADJUTANTS ON THE STAFF OF WHOM THE NEWCOMER WAS EVIDENTLY ONE ROSTOV FELT CONFUSED BLUSHED AND BECAME SILENT
1701-141760-0042 BORIS INQUIRED WHAT NEWS THERE MIGHT BE ON THIS STAFF AND WHAT WITHOUT INDISCRETION ONE MIGHT ASK ABOUT OUR PLANS
1701-141760-0043 WE SHALL PROBABLY ADVANCE REPLIED BOLKOPSKI EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO SAY MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER
1701-141760-0044 BYRNE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WITH GREAT POLITENESS WHETHER AS WAS RUMORED THE ALLOWANCE OF FORAGE MONEY TO CAPTAINS OF COMPANIES WOULD BE DOUBLED
1701-141760-0045 I IS THERE SAID ROSTOV ANGRILY AS IF INTENDING TO INSULT THE AIDE DE CAMP
1701-141760-0046 WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HE SAID YES THERE ARE MANY STORIES ALL TOLD ABOUT THAT AFFAIR
1701-141760-0047 BUT OUR STORIES ARE THE STORIES OF MEN WHO HAS BEEN UNDER THE ENEMY'S FIRE
1701-141760-0048 OUR STORIES HAVE SOME WIT NOT LIKE THE STORIES OF THOSE FELLOWS ON THE STAFF WHO GET REWARDS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
1701-141760-0049 HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME AND DON'T FORGET THAT I DO NOT REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED AND AS A MAN OLDER THAN YOU MY ADVICE IS TO LET THE MATTER DROP
1701-141760-0050 CRIED PRINCE ANDREW AND WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH HE WENT OUT
1701-141760-0051 AND HE WAS STILL MORE ANGRY AT HAVING OMITTED TO SEE HER
1701-141760-0052 HE ORDERED HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND COLDLY TAKING LEAVE OF MORRIS RODE HOME
1701-141760-0053 SHOULD HE GO TO HEADQUARTERS NEXT DAY AND CHANGE THAT AFFECTED ADJUTANT OR REALLY LET THE MATTER DROP WAS THE QUESTION THAT WORRIED HIM ALL THE WAY

2506-169427-0000 INTEREST HOWEVER STILL RUNS ON IN BOTH CASES THE PERIODICAL OR ACCIDENTAL PAYMENT OF IT JUST SERVING TO KEEP THE MEMORY OF THE AFFAIR ALIVE UNTIL AT LENGTH IN SOME EVIL HOUR POP COMES A CREDITOR UPON EACH AND BY DEMANDING PRINCIPLE UPON THE SPOT TOGETHER WITH FULL INTEREST TO THE VERY DAY MAKES THEM BOTH FEEL THE FULL EXTENT OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS
2506-169427-0001 AS THE LEADER FOR I HATE YOUR RIFTS HAS A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE I NEED NOT SAY MORE TO SATISFY HIM THAT MY HERO COULD NOT GO ON AT THIS RATE WITHOUT SOME SLIGHT EXPERIENCE OF THESE INCIDENTAL MEMENTOES
2506-169427-0002 TO SPEAK THE TRUTH HE HAD WANTONLY INVOLVED HIMSELF IN A MULTITUDE OF SMALL BOOKED DEBTS OF THIS STAMP WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING EUGENIUS'S FREQUENT ADVICE HE TOO MUCH DISREGARDED THINKING THAT AS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS CONTRACTED THROUGH ANY MALIGNANCY BUT ON THE CONTRARY FROM AN HONESTY OF MIND AND A MERE JOCUNDITY OF HUMOUR THEY WOULD ALL OF THEM BE CROSSED OUT IN COURSE
2506-169427-0003 EUGENIE WOULD NEVER ADMIT THIS AND WOULD OFTEN TELL HIM THAT ONE DAY OR OTHER HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE RECKONED WITH AND HE WOULD OFTEN ADD IN AN ACCENT OF SORROWFUL APPREHENSION TO THE UTTERMOST MIGHT
2506-169427-0004 WHAT INCLINED EUGENIS TO THE SAME OPINION WAS AS FOLLOWS
2506-169427-0005 YORICK FOLLOWED EUGENIO WITH HIS EYES TO THE DOOR HE THEN CLOSED THEM AND NEVER OPENED THEM MORE
2506-169427-0006 ALAS POOR YORIS

3660-172182-0002 THEN THEY SOUNDED THE DEATH HORN FOR SLAYING AND THEY ALL GATHERED ABOUT
3660-172182-0003 ONE WISHED THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE LADY BEST BELOVED BY HIM AND ANOTHER TO THAT LADY WHOM HE LOVED BEST
3660-172182-0004 AND AFTER MIDDAY THEY BEHELD AN UNSHAPELY LITTLE MAN ON A HORSE AND AFTER HIM A DAME OR A DAMSEL ALSO ON HORSEBACK AND AFTER HER A KNIGHT OF LARGE STATURE BOWED DOWN AND HANGING HIS HEAD LOW AND SORROWFULLY AND CLAD IN BROKEN AND WORTHLESS ARMOUR
3660-172182-0005 I KNOW NOT WHO THEY ARE SAID HE BUT I KNOW SAID GUENEVER THIS IS THE KNIGHT WHOM URRAINE PURSUED AND METHINKS THAT HE COMES NOT HERE BY HIS OWN FREE WILL
3660-172182-0006 BUT DURANT HAS OVERTAKEN HIM AND AVENGED THE INSULT OF THE MAIDEN TO THE UTTERMOST
3660-172182-0007 LADY SAID HE AT THE GATE HERE WAS A KNIGHT AND I SAW NEVER A MAN OF SO PITIFUL AN ASPECT TO LOOK UPON AS HE
3660-172182-0008 I DO SAID HE HE TELLS ME THAT HE IS EDERIN THE SON OF NUDE
3660-172182-0009 THEN SHE REPLIED I KNOW IT NOT
3660-172182-0010 SO GUENEVER WENT TO THE GATE TO MEET HIM HE ENTERED
3660-172182-0011 AND DURAND GREETS THEE WELL AND IN GREETING THEE HE COMPELLED ME TO COME HITHER TO DO THY PLEASURE FOR THE INSULT WHICH THY MAIDEN RECEIVED FROM THE DWARF NOR WHERE DID HE OVERTAKE THEE
3660-172182-0012 SIR SAID SHE WHEN THINKEST THOU THAT GERRANT WILL BE HERE
3660-172182-0013 TO MORROW LADY I THINK HE WILL BE HERE WITH THE MAIDEN
3660-172182-0014 I AM LORD SAID HE AND I HAVE MET WITH MUCH TROUBLE AND RECEIVED WOUNDS UNSUPPORTED
3660-172182-0015 WELL SAID ARTHUR FROM WHAT I HEAR IT BEHOVES GWENFER TO BE MERCIFUL TOWARDS THEE
3660-172182-0016 THE MERCY WHICH THOU DESIREST LORD SAID SHE WILL I GRANT TO ME SINCE IT IS AS INSULTING TO THEE THAT AN INSULT SHOULD BE OFFERED TO ME AS TO THYSELF
3660-172182-0017 THUS WILL IT BE BEST TO DO SAID ARTHUR LET THIS MAN HAVE MEDICAL CARE UNTIL IT BE KNOWN WHETHER HE WILL LIVE
3660-172182-0018 TO GUENEVER AND HER HANDMAIDENS SAYS HE
3660-172182-0019 AND THE STEWARD OF THAT HOUSEHOLD SO ORDERED HER
3660-172182-0020 AND BEING YOUNG HE CHANGED HIMSELF AND GREW TO HATE THE SIN THAT SEEMED SO LIKE HIS OWN OF MODRED ATTHA'S NEPHEW AND FELL AT LAST IN THE GREAT BATTLE FIGHTING FOR THE KING
3660-172182-0021 AND WHEN DURRANT CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE GUINEVER WAS HE SALUTED HER
3660-172182-0022 NOW THEY WENT IN AND DISMOUNTED
3660-172182-0023 HEAVEN PROTECT THEE SAID ARTHUR AND THE WONDER OF HEAVEN BE UNTO THEE
3660-172182-0024 AND INASMUCH AS THOU HAST VANQUISHED EDDIRON THE SON OF NUD THOU HAST HAD A PROSPEROUS CAREER
3660-172182-0025 THEN FROM THAT TIME SHE BECAME HIS WIFE
3660-172182-0026 AND THE MAIDEN TOOK UP HER ABODE IN A PALACE AND SHE HAD MANY COMPANIONS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND THERE WAS NO MAIDEN MORE ESTEEMED THAN SHE IN THE ISLAND OF BRITAIN
3660-172182-0027 AND A YEAR AND A SECOND AND THE THIRD HE PROCEEDED THUS UNTIL HIS FAME HAD FLOWN OVER THE FACE OF THE KINGDOM
3660-172182-0028 AND HE GREETS THEE WELL AS AN UNCLE SHALL GREET HIS NEPHEW AND AS A VASSAL SHOULD GREET HIS LORD
3660-172182-0029 AND THE NEIGHBOURING CHIEFS KNOWING THIS GREW INSOLENT TOWARD HIM AND COVERT HIS LAND AND POSSESSIONS
3660-172182-0030 AND ARTHUR TOLD DURRANT THE CAUSE OF THE MISSION AND OF THE COMING OF THE AMBASSADORS TO HIM OUT OF CORNWALL TRULY SAID DURRAIN BE IT TO MY ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE LORD I WILL DO ACCORDING TO THY WILL CONCERNING THIS EMBASSY
3660-172182-0031 WHAT DISCOURSE SAID GWENDER DO I HEAR BETWEEN YOU
3660-172182-0032 SAID GERAGINT I THINK I SHALL HAVE ENOUGH OF KNIGHTHOOD WITH ME AND THEY SET FORTH
3660-172182-0033 AND NEVER WAS THERE SEEN A FAIRER HOST JOURNEYING TOWARDS THAT SEVERN
3660-172182-0034 AND HE SAID TO DURRANT I AM A FEEBLE AND AN AGED MAN AND WHILE I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE DOMINIONS FOR THEE AND FOR MYSELF I DID SO
3660-172182-0035 AND EACH ONE ASKED THAT WHICH HE DESIRED
3660-172182-0036 AND THEY WERE NOT LONG IN FINDING SO EAGER WAS EVERY ONE TO BESTOW GIFTS AND OF THOSE WHO CAME TO ASK GIFTS NONE DEPARTED UNSATISFIED
3660-172182-0037 THEN GIRAINE SENT EMBASSES TO THE MEN OF CORNWALL TO ASK THEM MISS
3660-172182-0038 AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WOULD BE THE FULNESS OF JOY AND HONOUR TO THEM FOR DURRANT TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR HOMAGE
3660-172182-0039 SO HE RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF SUCH AS WERE THEY
3660-172182-0040 AND A DAY AFTER THE FOLLOWERS OF ARTHUR INTENDED TO GO AWAY
3660-172183-0000 GIRAINT AS HE HAD BEEN USED TO DO WHEN HE WAS AT ARTHUR'S COURT FREQUENTED TOURNAMENTS
3660-172183-0001 BEFORE DURAIN THE SCOURGE OF THE ENEMY I SAW STEEDS WHITE WITH FOAM AND AFTER THE SHOUT OF BATTLE A FEARFUL TORRENT
3660-172183-0002 THESE TIDINGS WENT TO URBAN
3660-172183-0003 NOT I BY MY CONFESSIONS UNTO HEAVEN SAID SHE THERE IS NOTHING MORE HATEFUL UNTO ME THAN THIS
3660-172183-0004 THEN THE TEARS SHE SAID AND THE WORDS SHE HAD SPOKEN AWOKE HIM
3660-172183-0005 AN EVIL BETIDE ME SAID HE IF THOU RETURNEST THERE UNTIL THOU KNOWEST WHETHER I HAVE LOST MY STRENGTH SO COMPLETELY AS THOU DIDST SAY
3660-172183-0006 THEN GERAINE WENT TO SEE URBAN
3660-172183-0007 SIR SAYS HE I AM GOING UPON A QUEST AND I AM NOT CERTAIN WHEN I MAY COME BACK
3660-172183-0008 TAKE HEED THEREFORE UNTO THY POSITIONS UNTIL MY RETURN
3660-172183-0009 BUT ONE WOMAN ONLY WILL GO WITH ME
3660-172183-0010 AND HE DESIRED ENID TO MOUNT HER HORSE AND TO RIDE FORTH AND TO KEEP A LONG WAY BEFORE HIM
3660-172183-0011 AND ALTHOUGH I SPEAK UNTO THEE SAY NOT THOU ONE WORD EITHER
3660-172183-0012 AND THOUGH THOU SHOULDST DESIRE TO SEE MY DEFEAT AND MY DEATH AT THE HANDS OF THOSE MEN YET DO I FEEL NO DREAD
3660-172183-0013 THEN HE RECEIVED HIM AND THAT NOT FEEBLY
3660-172183-0014 HE SAY NOT ONE WORD UNTO ME UNLESS I SPEAK FIRST UNTO THEE
3660-172183-0015 I'LL DO AS FAR AS I CAN LORD SAID SHE ACCORDING TO THY DESIRE
3660-172183-0016 AH MAIDEN SAID HE IT IS VAIN TO ATTEMPT PROCEEDING FURTHER
3660-172183-0017 I CANNOT BY ANY MEANS REFRAIN FROM SLEEP THROUGH WEARINESS SAID HE DO THOU THEREFORE WATCHED THE HORSES AND SLEEP NOT
3660-172183-0018 AND WHEN SHE SAW THE DAWN OF DAY APPEAR SHE LOOKED ROUND HER TO SEE IF HE WERE WAKING AND THEREUPON HE AWOKE
3660-172183-0019 AND THEY LEFT THE WOOD AND THEY CAME TO AN OPEN COUNTRY WITH MEADOWS ON ONE HAND AND MOSES MOWING THE MEADOWS
3660-172183-0020 MY LORD HE SAID WILL IT BE DISPLEASING TO THEE IF I ASK WHENCE THOU COMEST ALSO
3660-172183-0021 WILT THOU FOUL MY HANDS SAID THE YOUTH AND TAKE THY MEAL FROM ME
3660-172183-0022 THAT SORT OF MEAL HE INQUIRED
3660-172183-0023 THEN THEY WANDERED AND TOOK THEIR REPAST
3660-172183-0024 GO NOW LORD SAID HE TO MEET THE KNIGHT AND TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS LODGING
3660-172183-0025 I WILL YOU LORD SAID SHE AS THOU SAYEST
3660-172183-0026 AND AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRANK GERRAINE WENT TO SLEEP AND SO DID ENID ALSO
3660-6517-0000 THE DATES SEEM UNIMPORTANT AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE SHIP HAVE BEEN UNREMITTINGLY BUSY
3660-6517-0001 BOWER ATTACKED THE SHIP'S STORES SURVEYED RELISTED AND RESTOWED THEM SAVING VERY MUCH SPACE BY UNSTOWING NUMEROUS CASES AND STOWING THE CONTENTS IN THE LAZARETTE
3660-6517-0002 WITHOUT STEAM THE LEAK CAN NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH THE HAND PUMP BY TWO DAILY SHIFTS OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES
3660-6517-0003 AS THE SHIP WAS AND IN HER PRESENT HEAVILY LADEN CONDITION HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE OR FOUR HOURS EACH DAY
3660-6517-0004 THE LARGE GREEN TENT WAS PUT UP AND PROPER SUPPORT MADE FOR IT
3660-6517-0005 THE ENGINE ROOMS STAFF AND ANDERSEN'S PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOWING THEIR LABORATORIES THE COOK REFITTING HIS GALLEY AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD ITS BAND OF WORKERS
3660-6517-0006 A MAN'S SPACE SUCH AS IT IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FORE HATCH TO THE STEM ON THE MAIN DECK
3660-6517-0007 UNDER THE FORECASTLE ARE STALLS OF FIFTEEN PONIES THE MAXIMUM SPACE WILL HOLD THE NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT IS PACKED TIGHT WITH FODDER
3660-6517-0008 IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FORECASTLE BULKED IS A SMALL BOOBY HATCH THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE MEN'S MESS DECK IN BAD WEATHER
3660-6517-0009 ABAFT THAT FORE HATCH IS THE ICE HOUSE
3660-6517-0010 WE MANAGED TO GET THREE TONS OF ICE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO CAUCASSES OF MUTTON AND THREE CAUCASES OF BEEF BESIDES SOME BOXES OF SWEETBREADS AND KIDNEYS INTO THIS SPACE
3660-6517-0011 THE SACKS CONTAINING THIS LAST ADDED TO THE GOODS ALREADY MENTIONED MAKE A REALLY HEAVY DE CAGO AND ONE IS NATURALLY ANXIOUS CONCERNING IT BUT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY LASHING AND SECURING HAS BEEN DONE
3660-6517-0012 FORAGE I ORIGINALLY USED THIRTY TONS OF COMPRESSED OAT AND HAY FROM MELBOURNE
3660-6517-0013 THE SCENE IS WHOLLY ENCHANTING AND SUCH A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER OF A GARDEN WHICH BLAZES WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION WITH ALL THINGS
3660-6517-0014 A GREATER MASS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED
3660-6517-0015 KAY AND I LUNCH WITH A PARTY IN THE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY'S SHIP RUPHOO
3660-6517-0016 TELEGRAM TO SAY TERRA NOVA HAD ARRIVED SUNDAY NIGHT
3660-6517-0017 A THIRD SLEDGE STANDS ACROSS THE BREAK OF THE POOP IN THIS SPACE HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY THE AFTER WINCH
3660-6517-0018 THE QUANTITY IS TWO AND AN HALF TONS AND THE SPACE OCCUPIED CONSIDERABLE
3660-6517-0019 THE SHIP WAS OVER TWO FEET ON THE STERN BUT THIS WILL SOON BE REMEDIED
3660-6517-0020 THEY MUST PERFORCE BE CHAINED UP AND THEY ARE GIVING WHAT SHELTER IS AFFORDED ON DECK BUT THEIR POSITION IS NOT ENVIABLE
3660-6517-0021 IT IS A PATHETIC ATTITUDE DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY OCCASIONALLY SOME POOR BEAST EMITS A LITTLE PATHETIC WHINE
3660-6517-0022 THERE ARE GENERALLY ONE OR TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASES MATTERS FOR IT IS A SQUASH
3660-6517-0023 LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND HAS VEERED TO THE WESTWARD HEADING US SLOWLY
3660-6517-0024 OATES AND ATKINSON WITH INTERMITTENT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHERS WERE BUSY KEEPING THE PONIES UPON THEIR LEGS
3660-6517-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EVIL AND NEARLY ALL HANDS WERE LABOURING FOR HOURS IN THE WAISTS OF THE SHIP HEAVING COAL SACKS OVERBOARD AND RE LASHING THE PETROL CASES ET CETERA IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
3660-6517-0026 NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED THAN SOME EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY WAVES WOULD TEAR AWAY THE LASHING AND THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN
3660-6517-0027 FROM THIS MOMENT ABOUT FOUR A M THE ENGINE ROOM BECAME A CENTER OF INTEREST
3660-6517-0028 THE WATERS GAINED IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT
3660-6517-0029 HIS OUTLOOK APPEARED GRIM
3660-6517-0030 THE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH WAS BEING MADE WITH THE SHIPS SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS VERY UNCERTAIN
3660-6517-0031 WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW FIRE FOR WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
3660-6517-0032 THE BILAGE PUMP HAS DEPENDENT UPON THE MAIN ENGINE
3660-6517-0033 ON ONE OCCASION I WAS WAIST DEEP WHEN SITTING ON THE RAIL OF THE POOP
3660-6517-0034 THE AFTERGUARD WERE ORGANISED IN TWO PARTIES BY EVANS TO WORK BUCKETS THE MEN WERE KEPT STEADILY GOING ON THE CHOKED HAND PUMPS THIS SEEMED ALL THAT COULD BE DONE FOR THE MOMENT AND WHAT A MEASURE TO COUNT AS THE SOLE SAFEGUARD OF THE SHIP FROM SINKING PRACTICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BAIL HER OUT
3660-6517-0035 OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD BARE ONE OF THEM AWAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED BY HIS CHAIN
3663-172005-0000 THE FAWN HAD TAKEN THIS MORNING MEAL AND NOW LAY CURLED UP UPON A BED OF MOSS
3663-172005-0001 WHENEVER THE FAWN CUT UP HE WAS QUITE CONTENT TO FRISK ABOUT
3663-172005-0002 THE DANGER WAS CERTAIN NOW IT WAS CLEAR
3663-172005-0003 THE HOUNDS HAD STRUCK A TRAIL WHERE SHE STOOD AND THE FAWN WAS SAFE
3663-172005-0004 ONE WAS ROWING THE OTHER HAD A GUN IN HIS HAND WHAT SHOULD WE DO
3663-172005-0005 HIS TIRED LEGS COULD NOT PROPEL THE TIRED BODY RAPIDLY
3663-172005-0006 THE DOE SAW THE BOAT NEAR HER
3663-172005-0007 IN A MOMENT MORE THE BOAT WAS ON HER AND THE MEN OF THE OARS HAD LEANED OVER AND CAUGHT HER
3663-172528-0000 I WAS TORMENTED BY THIRST BUT WAS ABSTAINED FROM DRINKING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS
3663-172528-0001 AND OLD MAN CEASED TO GIVE SO MUCH ANNOYANCE YET SOMETIMES HE APPEARED TO ME IN DREAMS
3663-172528-0002 FELICIA I GIVEN THEM ORDERS NOT TO SPEAK TO ME OF THIS
3663-172528-0003 THAT MAID HAD STOLEN FROM ME CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND IN HER FEAR OF BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD DIED
3663-172528-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE ALLOWED ME TWICE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FULL I THEN COVERED MYSELF AND BEGAN TO SWELL AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
3663-172528-0005 THEY SAY THAT MY POOR FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO RELIEVED WAS HE TO HEAR THIS
3663-172528-0006 AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY STATE AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE SERVING GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT SHOUTING OUT I TRAITRESS YOU HAVE KILLED HIM FOR ME THEN
3663-172528-0007 SHE MAY INDEED HAVE SAVED MY LIFE SO LEND ME A HELPING HAND FOR I HAVE SWEATED AND BE QUICK UPON IT
3663-172528-0008 FELICIAN RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS DRIED AND MADE ME COMFORTABLE AND I BEING CONSCIOUS OF A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN MY STATE BEGAN TO RECKON ON RECOVERY
3663-172528-0009 JUST THEN THE OTHER DOCTOR BERNARDINO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAS REFUSED TO BLEED ME
3663-172528-0010 MAESTRO FRANCESCO THIS MOST ABLE MAN EXCLAIMED OH POWER OF NATURE
3663-172528-0011 SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND MY PHYSICIANS KNOW NOTHING
3663-172528-0012 THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED UPON THE SPOT
3663-172528-0013 AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE
3663-172528-0014 I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED MY THIRSTS
3663-172528-0015 IN THE LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED YOU TO BLEED HIM
3663-172528-0016 IF YOU KNEW THAT THIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE
3663-172528-0017 WE MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HIS CURE
3663-172528-0018 AT THE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN
3663-172528-0019 THE VERY EVENING I WAS TAKING WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD
3663-172528-0020 DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR IF HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME IN ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM
3663-172528-0021 THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I SHALL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE
3663-172528-0022 SO I MADE MY MIND UP AND PREPARED TO DRESS
3663-172528-0023 THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIERRE LANDAY WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
3663-172528-0024 NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE AQUITTO WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
3663-172528-0025 I HAD HARBOURED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR THE MEN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS
3663-172528-0026 MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DE MONTEVERCI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL
3663-172528-0027 THERE THEY SERVED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY
3663-172528-0028 MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESS SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE
3663-172528-0029 AT THESE WORDS MAESTRA AGOSTINO THE DUKE'S TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT THIS VERY MOMENT
3663-172528-0030 GEORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MYASRA AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED THERE IS THE MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NOT
3663-172528-0031 AS FIERCELY AS I COULD NOR BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED GIORGIO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0032 HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO AND THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THE LORD
3663-172528-0033 MAESTRO AGOSTINO SHOUTED YOU GALLOWS BIRD
3663-172528-0034 DON'T YOU KNOW IT I KNOW IT FOR MOST CERTAIN
3663-172528-0035 GEORGIAN MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0036 THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE JEW CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND HE HALTED
3663-172528-0037 THE DUC GAZED AT ME AND MARVELLED I WAS STILL ALIVE AFTERWARDS HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH
3663-172528-0038 WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTEGUTTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME
3663-172528-0039 I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND TOLD ME ALL THE AFFAIR ABOUT THE MINT
3663-172528-0040 HE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE MY VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT
3663-172528-0041 I IN THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIETRO PAGOLO ADVICE ABOUT STAMPING THE COINS AND THEN WENT OFF UPON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE DUKE OR ANYBODY ELSE
3663-172528-0042 YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALIZED THAT FEROCIOUS TYRANT
3663-172528-0043 YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MY MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS
3663-172528-0044 IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF PAPA CLEMENT
3663-172528-0045 MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DIES FOR THAT MEDAL
3663-172528-0046 I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE
3663-172528-0047 I THEN SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENZINO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL
3663-172528-0048 NICCOLO DA MONTERETTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENCINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
3663-172528-0049 NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS VERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
3663-172528-0050 I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK TO MY BEST ABILITY
3663-172528-0051 THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT MERIT HE HAD GAINED
3663-172528-0052 I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT ONE OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL
3663-172528-0053 I NEVER USED TO SHOOT AT MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING
3663-172528-0054 I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN DOWN THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROME
3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING THREE HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE
3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE IN EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE
3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADES THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF KOANNA
3915-57461-0003 HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FERRY BOATS THAT STOP AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED
3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SMOOTHLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM
3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RONAN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
3915-57461-0006 NOW ALAS AFTER THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE
3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED THIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM
3915-57461-0008 THEN THE ROANING SAID TO THE BOATMAN
3915-57461-0009 WHAT SEE YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS
3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONON HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONON OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO
3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVORING HIS SPECULATION HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD
3915-57461-0013 SINCE THAT ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF
3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF THE NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR
3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TOKOBAY FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERABLE MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME
3915-57461-0016 NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY HAD REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET
3915-57461-0017 AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER HIS COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER
3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO AT THE CUANNA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT
3915-57461-0019 HAPILY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART
3915-57461-0020 ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF OUR MARVELLOUS AILMENT
3915-57461-0021 THINKING I SHOULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
3915-57461-0022 AND DID IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALICE
3915-57461-0023 REPENT THEREFORE AND ABANDON MY EVIL WAYS
3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM A HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS
3915-57461-0025 BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COMES TO TORMENT YOU
3915-57461-0026 AND A FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROB YOU
3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN AND THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIMS VENGEANCE WOULD SOMEDAY OVERTAKE ME
3915-57461-0028 HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHTS I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL
3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW YOU MANAGE TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I COULD UNDERSTAND
3915-57461-0030 A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND AND THE CHATTERING OF A STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT
3915-98647-0000 EVERY WELL ORDERED JAPANESE HOME OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTRE OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF A HOUSE
3915-98647-0001 SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY AND ANNIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR HOUSEHOLD GODS
3915-98647-0002 THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHER AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD
3915-98647-0003 VISITS TO NOTED TABLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION
3915-98647-0004 ALL THESE WERE PUT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT THE CHARTED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SON
3915-98647-0005 AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THEIR MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE
3915-98647-0006 EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILFUL BALANCER OF PROSE AND KHANS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR OF ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE
3915-98647-0007 IN THE GREATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE THE HOME PROPHECIES ARE FELT TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN AND THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED IN
3915-98647-0008 NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN THAT DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR
3915-98647-0009 AFTER THE MANNER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE IS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS
3915-98647-0010 OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHEN THE ROPE IS RAISED
3915-98647-0011 THE HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SENT BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
3915-98647-0012 A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABOURERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGEPOLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SCRAMBLE JOYFULLY
3915-98647-0013 ALL COME WHO MAY AND THOSE WHO CANNOT COME SEND SERVANTS OR PROVISIONS
3915-98647-0014 ON THE DAY AFTER THEIR DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN A CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS THE STYLE COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN
3915-98647-0015 NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH A BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES A SURVIVAL OF THE OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE
3915-98647-0016 AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE BATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE
3915-98647-0017 THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DO CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL
3915-98647-0018 UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL HIS LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS
3915-98647-0019 WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IT IS DRESSED IN WHITE AND SILK HABU TIE WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT
3915-98647-0020 THE BODY TO BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEE THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS
3915-98647-0021 THE DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THE COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THAT THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD
3915-98647-0022 THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MIGHT BE PUT IN TO FEED THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH
3915-98647-0023 LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFEE ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF TEA
3915-98647-0024 SO LONG AS THE COFFEE IS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY
3915-98647-0025 IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFINS IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES
3915-98647-0026 THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WOULD DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY
3915-98647-0027 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THEIR CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED
3915-98647-0028 A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUKI ZAWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING
3915-98647-0029 IN HIS WILL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING ON THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED
3915-98647-0030 THROUGH HIS GROWING FEELING AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES
3915-98647-0031 JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIEND OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY
3915-98647-0032 ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SET TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT
3915-98647-0033 SOMETIMES WITH THE GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN A FUNERAL TRAIN
3915-98647-0034 ANOTHER FAVORITE RESIDENCE AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON
3915-98647-0035 IT WAS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURIAL
3915-98647-0036 DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE AND A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET UP IN THE DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED
4153-185072-0000 HE TARRIED AT GENESHAW A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP TO GADOL WHERE I THEN RESIDED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE WINTER CAME ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS STAY
4153-185072-0001 THE ENRAGED HUSBAND WELL KNOWING THAT HE SHOULD FEEL A BLOW IF HE WAITED TO HEAR THE ORDERS REPEATED INSTANTLY RETREATED AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS CATTLE
4153-185072-0002 WE PROTECTED THE POOR NANTICOKE WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUALS AND ALLAN SYMPATHIZED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES TILL SPRING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE PROMISED A REFORMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OF RENEWAL OF HER AFFECTIONS
4153-185072-0003 THE INDIANS WERE SOON ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN OFFICER THAT HIS WAMPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS ARDENTLY WISHED FOR
4153-185072-0004 MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ALAN'S HORSES AND CARRIED THE GOODS
4153-185072-0005 ALLEYNE ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT ON HIS RETURN THEY WERE SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTLES WHO MARRIED PRISCILLA RAMSAY WITH A SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM
4153-185072-0006 NETTLES AT LENGTH ABANDONED THE CHASE WENT HOME AND ALEEN ALL IN TATTERS CAME IN
4153-185072-0007 WHEN RUNNING IN THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO RAGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SUFFERING CONDITION ALMOST NAKED
4153-185072-0008 ALLEYNE MADE HIS TROUSERS HIMSELF AND THEN BUILT A RAFT ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MONT MORS
4153-185072-0009 THERE AN INDIAN GAVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A GOOD ONE WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE BEARDSTOWN WHERE HE FOUND HIS SQUAW
4153-185072-0010 NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THE PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GARDO
4153-185072-0011 THE LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SWIFTNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAKE THIS ESCAPE TO HIS FORMER CASTLE OF SAFETY
4153-185072-0012 HIS PURSUERS WENT IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETED AND UNDER MY PROTECTION
4153-185072-0013 STILL UNSATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THEY ADVISED MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME A SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDERED OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT TO MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF HIS SITUATION AND FINALLY THEY LEFT ME
4153-185072-0014 HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOKE ME WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION FEARING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
4153-185072-0015 AT THAT TIME ALLEN LAY IN A SECRET PLACE IN THE GULF A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FLATS IN A HOLE THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER
4153-186222-0000 THERE'S LITTLE DANGER IN THIS QUARTER I'M SURE SO I MAY AS WELL BE FRIENDS WITH THAT POOR CHILD
4153-186222-0001 BUT WHY NOT
4153-186222-0002 BEV HESITATED
4153-186222-0003 THAT LETTER ASKING ME TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAD EVER RECEIVED FROM HER
4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE SHE ASKED ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FRIENDLY AND I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
4153-186222-0005 SURELY TWO BOYS WILL HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS LONELY OLD PLACE THAN ONE COULD HAVE ALONE
4153-186222-0006 OH YES SHE HAS CORRECTED LOUIS
4153-186222-0007 WE MEAN PATRICIA DOYLE YES
4153-186222-0008 THEN WE MAY CONCLUDE SHE'S LEFT OUT OF THE ARGUMENT SAID BETH CALMLY
4153-186222-0009 YOU'LL FIGHT WITH YOUR OWN CHANCE AND FIGHT MIGHTY HARD
4153-186222-0010 WHY MY DEAR HUSBAND I DON'T WANT AUNT JANE'S MONEY
4153-186222-0011 MY MOTHER AND I ARE AMPLY PROVIDED FOR AND I AM ONLY HERE TO FIND REST FROM MY SOCIAL DUTIES AND TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH MY FATHER'S SISTER THAT IS ALL
4153-186222-0012 MY FATHER TEACHES MUSIC AND FATHER SCOLDS HIM CONTINUALLY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT
4153-186222-0013 WE'VE NEVER SEEN A CENT OF HER MONEY THOUGH FATHER HAS TRIED AT TIMES TO BORROW ENOUGH TO HELP HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
4153-186222-0014 I EVEN KILLED HER WHEN SHE ASKED ME TO AND IT SENT A SHIVER ALL DOWN MY BACK
4153-186222-0015 FOR MY PART I AM FOND OF EVERYBODY AND IT DELIGHTS ME TO FUSS ROUND INVALIDS AND ASSIST THEM
4153-186222-0016 YOU SAY YOU'LL LIKE TO CARE FOR IN MILLIDS AND I DON'T
4153-186222-0017 YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME THINK YOU DON'T WANT ELMHURST WHERE YOU'RE AS ANXIOUS TO GET IT AS I AM
4153-186222-0018 THEY CALLS ME BETH SULLENLY
4153-186222-0019 I COULDN'T LIVE IN THE OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW
4153-186222-0020 BUT SHE LEAVES IT TO YOU PERSISTED BET
4153-186222-0021 ALICE SEEMED TO MEDITATE
4153-186222-0022 IT'S A MAGNIFICENT MISTAKE SAID BETH LOOKING AT HER COUSIN DOUBTFULLY
4153-186222-0023 NOW SHALL WE BE FRIENDS SHE ANSWERED LIGHTLY
4153-186222-0024 TO BE SURE I SHOULD WANT YOU TO MY LORD
4153-186222-0025 SUCH A GIRL FRIEND IT HAD NEVER BEEN HER PRIVILEGE TO HAVE BEFORE AND WHEN HER SUSPICIONS WERE FORGOTTEN SHE BECAME FAIRLY RESPONSIVE AND BRIGHTENED BEAUTIFULLY
4153-186222-0026 LILAS SHE SAID WHEN HE ENTERED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY NIECES
4153-186222-0027 THEY ARE VERY CHARMING GIRLS HE ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THEY ARE IN AN AGE WHEN FEW GIRLS SHOW TO GOOD ADVANTAGE
4153-186222-0028 WHY DID YOU NOT INVITE KANNES TO DINNER JANE THE BOY
4153-186222-0029 HE IS CONSTANTLY DOING DISAGREEABLE THINGS
4153-186222-0030 VERY WELL SAID THE LAWYER QUIETLY WHICH OF MY NAMES DO YOU PREFER
4153-186222-0031 SAID THE OLD LADY AFTER A PAUSE I CANNOT SAY ON SO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE HE ANSWERED WITH GRAVITY WHICH DO YOU PREFER JANE
4153-186222-0032 THEY'RE EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY SHE ANSWERED
4153-186222-0033 I CANNOT IMAGINE ELMHURST BELONGING TO EITHER SILIS
4153-186222-0034 I MUST SEE THAT OTHER THIEF THE ONE WHO DEFIES ME AND REFUSES TO ANSWER MY SECOND LETTER
4153-186222-0035 THERE WOULD BE A DOZEN AIRS TO FIGHT FOR MY MONEY AND DEAR OLD ELMHURST WOULD BE SOLD TO STRANGERS SHE RETURNED WITH BITTERNESS
4153-186223-0000 IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE ROOM KENNETH FORBES SQUATTED UPON A BENCH WITH A EMPTY PINE BOX HELD CARELESSLY IN HIS LAP
4153-186223-0001 WHILE DUNCAN WORKED THE BOY WAS BUSY WITH HIS PENCIL BUT NEITHER HAD SPOKE FOR AT LEAST A HALF HOUR
4153-186223-0002 THEN RIDING SLOWLY UP THAT HEDGE BORDERED ROAD HIS TROUBLES ONCE MORE ASSAILED HIM AND HE WONDERED IF THERE WAS NOT SOME SPOT UPON THE BROAD EARTH TO WHICH HE COULD FLY FOR RETIREMENT UNTIL THE GIRLS HAD LEFT ELMHURST FOR GOOD
4153-186223-0003 NORAH SHIED AND HE LOOKED UP TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAD NEARLY RUN DOWN A PEDESTRIAN A STOUT LITTLE MAN WITH A BUNDLE UNDER HIS ARMS WHO HELD UP ONE HAND AS IF TO ARREST HIM
4153-186223-0004 DO YOU WANT TO GO ASKED THE BOY
4153-186223-0005 THEN IT'S THE SAME JOHN AS EVER HE RESPONDED WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
4153-186223-0006 DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT OR HOPED SHE'D REFORMED AND I'D BE GLAD TO SEE HER AGAIN THEY TELL ME SHE'S GOT MONEY
4153-186223-0007 AUNT JANE'S RICH UNCLE JANE
4153-186223-0008 ECHOED THE MAN QUIETLY WHAT YOU NAME LAD
4153-186223-0009 DON'T LIKE GIRLS I SAY IT
4153-186223-0010 ANOTHER LONG PAUSE THEN THE BOY SUDDENLY TURNED QUESTIONING HER
4153-186223-0011 YOU KNOW OUR MISS MERRICK SIR
4153-186223-0012 I USED TO WHEN YOU WERE BOTH YOUNGER
4153-186223-0013 KENNETH STOPPED SHORT AND THE BEAR STOPPED AND THE LITTLE MAN WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT ALSO STOPPED
4153-186223-0014 JOHN MERRICK THAT'S YOU
4153-186223-0015 YOU WILL THE TINSMITH
4153-186223-0016 THEY KEPT TRACK OF HER BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY BECAME RICH AND A GREAT LADY AND THAT WAS A SURPRISING THING TO HAPPEN TO EMMERRICK
4153-186223-0017 THANK YOU LAD RETURNED THE MAN GRATEFULLY I THOUGHT A LITTLE EXERCISE WOULD DO ME GOOD BUT THIS THREE MILES WAS SEEMED LIKE THIRTY TO ME
4153-186223-0018 I'LL SAID THE MAN
4153-186223-0019 THE BOY TURNED AWAY BUT IN A MOMENT BOLTED AGAIN
4153-186223-0020 HIS INTEREST ON MISS JANE'S BROTHER JOHN WAS EXTRAORDINARY
4153-61735-0000 THEY ARE BUT LUKEWARM LOVERS WHO CAN CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH A DIALOGUE CARRIED ON AT BEAUCOT DISTANCE
4153-61735-0001 IF THERE BE AN ELYSIUM ON EARTH IT IS
4153-61735-0002 HIS OWN DAUGHTER HIS ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE BEST BLOOD OF SOUTHERN ARISTOCRACY BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING TO SECURE HIM A SPLENDID ALLIANCE HOLDING A KNIGHTLY ASSIGNATION WITH A HORSE HUNTER
4153-61735-0003 HE COULD WELL CONCEDE SO MUCH TO HER CAPRICE SINCE HER STAYING AT HOME COULD BE NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE CAUSES THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO THE STERN COUNCIL
4153-61735-0004 IT IS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THIS ROAD PASSED THE HACIENDA OF CASA DEL CORDO AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER
4153-61735-0005 ON REACHING THE COPSE HE DISMOUNTED LED HIS HORSE IN AMONG THE UNDERWOOD HITCHED HIM BY LOOPING HIS BRIDLE REIN AROUND THE TOPMOST TWIGS OF AN ELASTIC BOW THEN DETACHING A LONG ROPE OF TWISTED HORSEHAIR FROM THE HORN OF HIS SADDLE AND INSERTING HIS ARM INTO ITS COIL HE GLIDED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND ON THE SIDE THAT LAY TOWARDS THE HACIENDA
4153-61735-0006 BEFORE FORSAKING THE SHADOW OF THE CORPSE HE CAST A GLANCE TOWARDS THE SKY AND THE MOON SAILING SUPREMELY OVER IT
4153-61735-0007 THE DROLL CONCEIT WHICH HAS SO OFT AMUSED THE NOCTURNAL INEBRIATE OF GREAT CITIES APPEARED TO PRODUCE A LIKE EFFECT UPON THE NIGHT PATROLLER OF THE PRAIRIE AND FOR A MOMENT THE SHADOW LIGHT DARKENING HIS BROW DISAPPEARED
4153-61735-0008 IT'S NOT LIKELY IT THESE ARE UNLESS IT BE THE OWNER OF A BAD CONSCIENCE WHO CAN'T SLEEP
4153-61735-0009 TROTH THERE'S ONE SUCH WITHIN THE WALLS
4153-61735-0010 IF HE BE ABROAD THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF HIS SEEING ME UPON THE OPEN GROUND NOT THAT I SHOULD CARE A STRAW IF IT WERE ONLY MYSELF TO BE COMPROMISED
4153-61735-0011 IT'S NO USE WAITING UPON THE MOON DEUCE TAKERE
4153-61735-0012 IT IS TRUE HE HAD DESIGNS ON THE HACIENDA BUT THESE DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EITHER ITS CASH PLATE OR JEWELRY IF WE EXCEPT THE MOST PRECIOUS JEWEL IT CONTAINED THE MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HERSELF
4323-13259-0000 THE CHURCH BELLS WERE RINGING AND PEOPLE ON THE AVENUE GOING BY TO SERVICE TURNED CURIOUS INQUIRING LOOKS UP AT THAT GREAT HOUSE AND THEN WENT ON TALKING OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD SO STRANGELY ENTERED INTO AND MADE HISTORY IN THE CITY
4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSIONED APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION BUT WITH INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMOND HAD VOTED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SALON
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAYMOND STILL CONDEMNED BY THE RESULT
4323-13259-0004 FOR THIS HAD BEEN THE FACT IN RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULED
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM BRIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEAR ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 WHAT IF HE HAS BEGUN TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 THEN HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS
4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDISTURBED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY SELFISH EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOT THE DEEPER WELLS OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER AND RAIMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOREVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEETINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR EXPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON AND ITS AWFUL CURSES
4323-13259-0013 GREY AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY ENQUIRERS WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO IN PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 GREY HAD GONE TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER AND MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERALS SAID GREY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LOREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE HIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOUR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR JUDGMENTS IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PAGE THINK BEST WILL BE WRONG
4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DISPLAY AT SUCH TIMES BUT IT SEEMS DIFFERENT
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN THE NEIGHBOURING CITY
4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES OF THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH UNDER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN THE GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUID BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTRE OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALOONS
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUEER PART OF THIS STRANGE BUSINESS
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED
4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN ONE HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY
4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS PHRONSIE TURNED PAINFULLY AWAY
4323-18416-0001 I'LL TRY AND SHE LAID A QUIET HAND ON THE KNOB
4323-18416-0002 TWO RED SPOTS BURNED ON HER CHEEKS HER PALE BLUE EYES SNAPPED
4323-18416-0003 WHY I'M SURE I HEARD IT RAGING UP AND DOWN
4323-18416-0004 I DON'T WANT ANY DINNER SAID ROBERT DRAWING BACK
4323-18416-0005 YES INDEED SAYS POLLY CHEERILY JUST AS FINE AS CAN BE
4323-18416-0006 ASSUREDLY SAID OLD MISTER KING WITH GREAT SATISFACTION OF POLLY'S PLEASURE AND AT HER SUCCESS IN DRAWING CHARLOTTE OUT
4323-18416-0007 AND AFTER THIS THERE WERE NO MORE QUIET DAYS TO CHARLOTTE CHATTERTON
4323-18416-0008 OH BLESS ME IT'S YOU PHRONSIE AND PLEASED SURPRISE
4323-18416-0009 YES GRANDMAPA SAID PHRONSIE COMING IN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR CAREFULLY I CAME ON PURPOSE TO SEE YOU ALL ALONE
4323-18416-0010 SO YOU DID DEAR SAID MISTER KING HIGHLY GRATIFIED AND PUSHING AWAY THE WRITING TABLE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
4323-18416-0011 OH NO GRANDPAPA CRIED PHRONSIE IN A RAPTURE I COULD NEVER BE TOO BIG FOR THAT SO SHE PERCHED UP AS OF OLD ON HIS KNEES THEN SHE FOLDED HER HANDS AND LOOKED GRAVELY IN HIS FACE
4323-18416-0012 WELL MY DEAR WHAT IT
4323-18416-0013 ASKED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PRESENTLY YOU'VE GOT TO TELL ME SOMETHING I SUPPOSE
4323-18416-0014 YES GRANDPAPA I HAVE SAID PHRONSIE DECIDEDLY AND IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TOO GRANDPAPA AND OH I WISH IT SO MUCH AND SHE CLASPED HER HANDS TIGHTER AND SIGHED
4323-18416-0015 WELL THEN PHRONSIE IF YOU WANT IT I SUPPOSE IT MIGHT BE SAID MISTER KING QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
4323-18416-0016 AH SHE LEFT YOU EVERYTHING SHE HAD PHRONSIE A COUPLE OF MILLIONS OR SO IT IS WHY
4323-18416-0017 CHARLOTTES POOR REPEATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN

4323-18416-0019 GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE WASN'T MISTER CHATTERTON AUNT TO CHARLOTTE
4323-18416-0020 IF MISSUS CHATTERTON WAS AN AUNT TO CHARLOTTE PERSISTED PHRONSIE SLOWLY IT SEEMS AS IF CHARLOTTE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF THE MONEY IT REALLY DOES GRANDPAPA

4323-18416-0030 WHY HANG IT UNCLE WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME ALONE
4323-18416-0031 HE IS A WONDER INTERPOLATED PICKERING

4323-18416-0034 I'VE BEEN A LAZY DOG ALL MY LIFE AND GOOD FOR NOW BUT I HOPE I'VE NOT SUNK TO THAT
4323-55228-0000 THE NEXT MOMENT HE FELL BACK IN AMAZEMENT BEFORE THE IMPETUOUS RUSH OF A STARRY EYED LUSH CHEEKED YOUNG WOMAN WHO DEMANDED
4323-55228-0001 WHERE IS HE PETE MISS KITTY GASPED THE OLD MAN
4323-55228-0002 AUNT HANNAH'S CHEEKS TOO WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES STARRY BUT WITH DISMAY AND ANGER THE LAST BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PETE HAD SAID MISS BILLIE'S NAME
4323-55228-0003 IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO IT OF COURSE THAT'S SHE
4323-55228-0004 REPEATED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE IS HE
4323-55228-0005 INTRODUCED BILLY TELL MISTER BERTRAM I AM HERE OR WAIT I'LL GO RIGHT IN AND SURPRISE HIM
4323-55228-0006 PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE AT AUNT HANNAH
4323-55228-0007 MISS BILLY MISS BILLIE YOU'RE AN ANGEL STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN YOU ARE YOU ARE OH I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME
4323-55228-0008 HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT HE'S IN THE DEN MISS BILLY
4323-55228-0009 BILLY TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD MAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARDS THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AUNT HANNAH'S INDIGNANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BILLY STOP
4323-55228-0010 PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US TEE'S LIPS TWITCHED
4323-55228-0011 BUT HER FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN HE SPOKE
4323-55228-0012 A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES THREW OPEN
4323-55228-0013 DON GLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY
4323-55228-0014 IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GREY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK IN HILLSIDE
4323-55228-0015 THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER ME THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL
4323-55228-0016 AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USING
4323-55228-0017 WHY OF COURSE STAMMERED BILLY I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU HAVE FOUND OUT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
4323-55228-0018 DECLARED BERTRAM ANGRY AND MYSTIFIED
4323-55228-0019 AS FOR MY NOT PAINTING AGAIN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE
4323-55228-0020 SHE PULLED HERSELF HALF AWAY FROM BERTRAMS ENCIRCLING ARM
4323-55228-0021 BILLY DREW A COMFORTING SIGH
4323-55228-0022 GOOD HEAVENS IS JANE IN THIS TOO BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS SAVAGE NOW
4323-55228-0023 WELL HE WROTE A LETTER
4323-55228-0024 BILLY LAUGHED GAYLY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVERS EYES
4323-55228-0025 AND YOU DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM
4323-55228-0026 HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF EYELIDS
4323-55228-0027 BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LIFE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT'S
4323-55228-0028 AFTER A MINUTE BILLY STARED AND SIGHED HAPPILY
4323-55228-0029 YOU KNOW I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARKWRIGHT
4323-55228-0030 AND AND YOU DIDN'T CARE SPECIALLY FOR HER MISS WINTHROP
4323-55228-0031 POLLY PUT A SOFT FINGER ON HIS LIPS
4323-55228-0032 BERTRAM KISSED HIS FINGER AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED
4323-55228-0033 WELL WHAT IS THAT IS THAT KATE TWO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY
4323-55228-0034 THERE IS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERTRAM STIRRED
4323-55228-0035 REALLY I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY
4323-55228-0036 I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL THEN YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO TOMORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY
4323-55228-0037 I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW I'LL GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUND THAT I FORGOT
4323-55228-0038 SEVEN DAYS INDEED SIR
4323-55228-0039 I WONDER IF YOU THINK I CANNOT GET READY TO BE MARRIED IN FIVE DAYS
4323-55228-0040 DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY REPEATED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT
4323-55228-0041 IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTH AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE BUT
4323-55228-0042 AND BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAM CRAFTILY
4323-55228-0043 A TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT
4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART SEE HERE SIR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GOOD LEFT ARM
4323-55228-0045 BILL MY DEAR
4323-55228-0046 IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER
4323-55228-0047 WE MUST GO ON AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU
4323-55228-0048 YOU MEAN IT'LL BE AFTER OCTOBER
4323-55228-0049 AUNT HANNIE GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNCERTAINLY
4323-55228-0050 YES NODDED MARY DEMURELY
4323-55228-0051 YES I KNOW THERE IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM MERRILY
4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENS LAW
4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORLD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH SHE MUST NOW FULFIL
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS BEAUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SALAD DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT
4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WAR HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK
4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIANNE WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT
4515-11057-0006 HE WROTE TO MARIANA
4515-11057-0007 WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR GO AND SEE ME
4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BRIFFIN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THAT WAY OUT THERE
4515-11057-0010 I SUPPOSED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
4515-11057-0011 POVERTY I CAN ONLY
4515-11057-0012 BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS VIFFIN FOR A LONG TIME
4515-11057-0013 WAS HE REALLY SO VERY POOR
4515-11057-0014 ASKED AMY COMPASSIONATINGLY
4515-11057-0015 I'M AFRAID SO HIS WIFE FAILED UTTERLY
4515-11057-0016 WHY IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE THIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE
4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAYS AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS OBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
4515-11057-0020 AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG THE BRILLIANT WOMEN
4515-11057-0021 ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HIS FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
4515-11057-0022 IT SO SERIOUS
4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER DALE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
4515-11057-0024 YOUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT
4515-11057-0025 SHE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDENTLY
4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MINDS UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE
4515-11057-0027 HERE WAS SILENCE
4515-11057-0028 THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAS MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
4515-11057-0029 YOU RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME
4515-11057-0030 JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENTS
4515-11057-0031 YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN OUR WORK RECENTLY
4515-11057-0032 DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CARPET AND SO ON GENERALLY
4515-11057-0033 SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
4515-11057-0034 HER STORY IN A GIRL'S PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
4515-11057-0035 AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER IN REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
4515-11057-0036 I SURMISE IT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
4515-11057-0037 DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE SHE PLEADED
4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGEMENT ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT CAN I DO
4515-11057-0039 THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVANCE
4515-11057-0040 WELL I'LL GO BACK TO THE SCRIBBLING
4515-11057-0041 AGAIN JASPER HELD THE BRIGHT SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT
4515-11057-0042 YET FOR SUCH THINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY
4515-11057-0043 MARIAN DID NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF THE HEART
4515-11057-0045 AND HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY
4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THAT ADDED
4515-11057-0047 THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THIS BATTLE
4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARION
4515-11057-0049 WE ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER
4515-11057-0050 MORE OF A BRUTE YO MEAN
4515-11057-0051 YOU YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DON'T
4515-11057-0052 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR FRIENDS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY
4515-11057-0053 IS
4515-11057-0054 WILL YOU MARRY ME AND THEN LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE
4515-11057-0055 YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO MY FATHER AT PRESENT
4515-11057-0056 I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JAS
4515-11057-0057 SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT ME TOUCHINGLY
4515-11057-0058 DEAR I DON'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND
4515-11057-0059 HAS ONE TIME OCCURRED TO YOU
4515-11057-0060 WILL SHE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN
4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN THAT IS BEFORE HIM
4515-11057-0062 SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED
4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID IT IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU WERE MY WIFE
4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARY AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
4515-11057-0065 ACCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS JEALOUS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT
4515-11057-0066 DID YE THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE
4515-11057-0067 THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE A PLAIN TRUTH
4515-11057-0068 I DON'T PROMISE MYSELF
4515-11057-0069 BUT SHALL YOU FACE IT WILLINGLY
4515-11057-0070 PUT OUT YOUR UMBRELLA MARIAN
4515-11057-0071 WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE GLADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD YOU THINK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME
4515-11057-0073 WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IF THAT IS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0074 IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISGUST YOURSELF
4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN HENRY
4515-11057-0076 HOW AM I TO LIVE ONE HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS
4515-11057-0077 I TOO WISH IT
4515-11057-0078 HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM AND HER VOICE TREMBLED
4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR THE PARENTS
4515-11057-0080 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME
4515-11057-0081 IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR HER FATHER
4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MADAME I CAN'T STAND IT
4515-11057-0083 I CAN BE FAITHFUL TO YOU
4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREES HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
4515-11057-0085 MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT THE FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING
4515-11057-0086 IN WHAT MAY THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS
4515-11057-0087 BUT I COULDN'T SAY THE WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
4515-11057-0088 YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND IT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
4515-11057-0089 HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY CONSENT
4515-11057-0090 HAS IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
4515-11057-0091 BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME FOR THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
4515-11057-0092 IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I COULD LOVE YOU
4515-11057-0093 WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NO
4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO
4515-11057-0095 SOON INDEED YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT
4515-11057-0096 IT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOR DEMANDS IS COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THE TIME
4515-11057-0099 THAT IT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL WIND
4515-11057-0101 JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CARELESSLY
4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM YOURSELF
4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MOMENT MARIAN YOU CAN'T WORK
4515-11057-0104 I MUST NOT I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
4515-11057-0105 GOOD BYS SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
4515-11057-0106 THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE LIFTED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WANT HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HIS TONES AND ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW DAYS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
4515-11057-0110 YESTERDAY EVENING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE WAS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOURE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 THREE DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TRIALS TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT INFINITE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 INQUIRY WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FOR CIVIL LIFE
4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE SYSTEM WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITERS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTEE TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUES
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE FURRIER AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A WONDERFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOUR THAT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 BUT PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED TILL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HOUND AND LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON HER LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTER HOUND TO GET MORE SENSE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER ARE BRED BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HARRIER AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBOROUGH HOUND SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
4570-14911-0008 THEN THEY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE HOUSE
4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHASTON THE HOWSTEAD PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HOLTON THE LEE PARKS THE STOKEPLACE THE SEDINBURGH THE SURBITON THE TRINITY FOOTE THE WOOD DALE MISSUS G W HILLIARD'S MISSUS PRICE'S AND MISSUS TURNER'S

4831-25894-0035 BEFORE THEY WENT HOME THE KIND MAMMA TOLD TESSA SHE WOULD BE HER FRIEND AND GAVE HER A MOTHERLY KISS WHICH WARMED THE CHILD'S HEART AND SEEMED TO SET A SEAL UPON THAT PROMISE
4831-29134-0000 THE SENATOR TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE PULPIT WITH THE MINISTER ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS ON THE OTHER
4831-29134-0001 SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE PRESENCE OF A LIVING UNITED STATES SENATOR THAT DURING THREE MONTHS NOT A SPIT BALL WAS THROWN
4831-29134-0002 AFTER THAT THEY BEGAN TO COME TO THEMSELVES BY DEGREES AND PRESENTLY THE SPELL WAS WHOLLY GONE AND THEY WAS RECITING VERSES AND PULLING HAIR
4831-29134-0003 THE USUAL SUNDAY SCHOOL EXERCISES WERE HURRIED THROUGH AND THEN THE MINISTER GOT UP AND BORED THE HOUSE WITH A SPEECH BUILT ON THE CUSTOMARY SUNDAY SCHOOL PLAN THEN THE SUPERINTENDENT PUT ON HIS OAR THEN THE TOWN DIGNITARIES HAD THEIR SAY
4831-29134-0004 AM I IN SOME POPULOUS CENTRE OF MY OWN COUNTRY WHERE THE CHOICEST CHILDREN OF THE LAND HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND BROUGHT TOGETHER AS IN A FAIR FOR A PRIZE NO
4831-29134-0005 THEN WHERE AM I YES WHAT AM I
4831-29134-0006 MY SOUL IS LOST IN WONDER AT THE TRUTH
4831-29134-0007 LIFE HAS NO HIGHER NO GRANDER POSITION FOR ME
4831-29134-0008 THEN WHAT IS IT WHY DID MY CONSCIOUSNESS REPLY
4831-29134-0009 AH THINK OF THAT NOW I COULD HARDLY KEEP THE TEARS BACK I WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
4831-29134-0010 THEY COULD NOT GIVE HIM A COSTLY EDUCATION BUT THEY WERE GOOD AND WISE AND THEY SENT HIM TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL HE LOVE THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
4831-29134-0011 I HOPE YOU LOVE YOUR SUNDAY SCHOOL AYE SEE BY YOUR FACE THAT YOU DO THAT IS RIGHT
4831-29134-0012 ALWAYS LOVE YOUR TEACHERS MY CHILDREN FOR THEY LOVED YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN KNOW NOW
4831-29134-0013 AND BY AND BY THE PEOPLE MADE HIM GOVERNOR AND HE SAID IT WAS ALL GOING TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
4831-29134-0014 WHY THE PEOPLE GAVE HIM THE TOWERING ILLUSTRIOUS POSITION A GRAND IMPOSING POSITION
4831-29134-0015 IT WAS A SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES
4831-29134-0016 THAT POOR LITTLE BOY THAT LIVED HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL BECAME THAT MAN THAT MAN STANDS BEFORE YOU
4831-29134-0017 ABOVE ALL THINGS MY DAUGHTER BE HONEST
4831-29134-0018 WHEN SENATOR DILWORTHY DEPARTED FROM CAVALVILLE HE LEFT THREE DOZEN BOYS BEHIND HIM ARRANGING A CAMPAIGN OF LIFE WHOSE OBJECTIVE POINT WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATE
5543-27761-0000 LULETZKA WAS A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
5543-27761-0001 THERE WAS NO OTHER SUCH CHILD THERE NEVER HAS BEEN AND THERE NEVER WOULD BE
5543-27761-0002 LU LETCHKA'S MOTHER SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA WAS SURE OF THAT
5543-27761-0003 LULLET'S EYES WERE DARK AND LARGE HER CHEEKS WERE ROSY HER LIPS WERE MADE FOR KISSES AND FOR LAUGHTER
5543-27761-0004 BUT IT WAS NOT THESE CHARMS IN ALETCHKA THAT GAVE HER MOTHER THE KEENEST JOY
5543-27761-0005 SHE FELT COLD WITH HER COUSIN
5543-27761-0006 HE WAS ALWAYS FRESH AND COOL WITH A FRIGID SMILE AND WHEREVER HE PASSED GOLD CURRENTS SEEMED TO MOVE IN THE AIR
5543-27761-0007 IT EVEN SEEMED TO THE SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER FUTURE HUSBAND AND THIS MADE HER HAPPY
5543-27761-0008 THE BRIDE WAS ALSO GOOD LOOKING SHE WAS A SMALL DARK EYED DARK HAIRED GIRL SOMEWHAT TIMID BUT VERY TACTFUL
5543-27761-0009 HE HAS CONNECTIONS AND HIS WIFE CAME OF GOOD INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE
5543-27761-0010 THIS MUST AT THE PROPER OPPORTUNITY PROVE USEFUL
5543-27761-0011 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MANNER OF SERGEY MOROSOVITCH TO SUGGEST ANYTHING WRONG TO HIS WIFE
5543-27761-0012 LATER HOWEVER WHEN HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD SERGEY MAROSTOVITCH ESTABLISHED CONNECTIONS ELSEWHERE OF A LIGHT AND TEMPORARY NATURE
5543-27761-0013 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA FOUND THIS OUT AND TO HER OWN ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY HURT SHE AWAITED HER HUSBAND WITH A RESTLESS ANTICIPATION THAT SWALLOWED EVERY OTHER FEELING
5543-27761-0014 SARAFIMMA ALEXANDROVNA DRIFTED FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM HIM
5543-27761-0015 LETCHKA THEN RAN AWAY STAMPING WITH HER PLUMP LITTLE LEGS OVER THE CARPETS AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR HER BED
5543-27761-0016 WHERE IS MY BABY GIRL THE MOTHER ASKED AS SHE LOOKED FOR LAOLATCHKA AND MADE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID NOT SEE HER
5543-27761-0017 THEN SHE CAME OUT A LITTLE FARTHER AND HER MOTHER AS THOUGH SHE HAD ONLY JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SEIZED HER BY HER LITTLE SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED JOYOUSLY HERE SHE IS MY LALETCHKA
5543-27761-0018 MY MOTHER'S EYES GLOWED WITH PASSIONATE EMOTION
5543-27761-0019 HER MOTHER WENT TO GUIDE
5543-27761-0020 ALETCHKA TURNED AWAY AS THOUGH NOT TO SEE BUT WATCHED HER MAMUCHKA STEALTHILY ALL THE TIME
5543-27761-0021 WHERE IS MY MAMA MOCHKA ASKED LUETSHKA
5543-27761-0022 A SMILE OF ABSOLUTE BLISS PLAYING ON HER RED LIPS
5543-27761-0023 LU LETCHKA WAS GETTING NEAR HER MOTHER'S CORNER
5543-27761-0024 HER MOTHER WAS GROWING MORE ABSORBED EVERY MOMENT BY HER INTEREST IN THE GAME HER HEART BEAT IN SHORT QUICK STROKES AND SHE PRESSED EVEN CLOSER TO THE WALL DISARRANGING HER HAIR STILL MORE
5543-27761-0025 VALECHKA SUDDENLY GLANCED TOWARDS HER MOTHER'S CORNER AND SCREAMED WITH JOY
5543-27761-0026 THROUGH THE CLOSED DOORS HE HEARD THE LAUGHTER THE JOYOUS OUTCRIES THE SOUND OF ROMPING
5543-27761-0027 EVEN PHOTOSIA FELT ABASHED NOW FOR HER MISTRESS NOW FOR HERSELF
5543-27761-0028 HE LIKED COMING HERE WHEN EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED THIS WAS DONE BY SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA WHO WISHED TO SURROUND HER LITTLE GIRL FROM HER VERY INFANCY ONLY WITH THE LOVELIEST THINGS
5543-27761-0029 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA DRESSED HERSELF TASTEFULLY THIS TOO SHE DID FOR LULLETTESHKA WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW
5543-27761-0030 ONE THING SERGEY MONASTOVITCH HAD NOT BECOME RECONCILED TO AND THIS WAS HIS WIFE'S ALMOST CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN THE NURSERY
5543-27761-0031 IT'S JUST AS I THOUGHT I KNEW THAT I'D FIND YOU HERE SHE SAID WITH A DERISIVE AND CONDESCENDING SMILE
5543-27761-0032 MERELY TO SEE THAT THE CHILD SHOULD FEEL ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY HE EXPLAINED IN ANSWER TO SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA'S PUZZLED GLANCE
5543-27761-0033 HE'S STILL SO LITTLE SAID SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0034 I DON'T INSIST IT'S YOUR COMPANY HERE
5543-27761-0035 I'LL THINK IT OVER HIS WIFE ANSWERED SMILINGLY AS HE DID COLDLY BUT GENIALLY
5543-27761-0036 THEN THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF NOTHING ELSE
5543-27761-0037 THAT THE MISTRESS DOES IT WELL THAT'S ONE THING BUT THAT THE YOUNG LADY DOES THAT'S BAD
5543-27761-0038 WHY ASKED FEDOSIO WITH CURIOSITY
5543-27761-0039 AN EXPRESSION OF CURIOSITY GAVE HER FACE THE LOOK OF A WOODEN ROUGHLY PAINTED DOLL
5543-27761-0040 YES THAT'S BAD REPEATED AGATHYOU WITH CONVICTION TERRIBLY BAD WELL
5543-27761-0041 IT'S THE TRUTH I'M SAYING REMEMBER MY WORDS AGATHYA WENT ON WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE AND SECRECY
5543-27761-0042 IT'S THE SUREST SOUND
5543-27761-0043 THE OLD WOMAN HAD INVENTED A SIGN QUITE SUDDENLY HERSELF AND SHE WAS EVIDENTLY VERY PROUD OF IT
5543-27761-0044 MADAME ADAM SHE SAID QUIETLY IN A TREMBLING VOICE
5543-27761-0045 SARIFIMA ALEXANDROVNA GAVE A START
5543-27761-0046 FEDOSTA'S FACE MADE HER ANXIOUS
5543-27761-0047 WHAT IS IT FEDOSYA SHE ASKED WITH GREAT CONCERN IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH LUETZKA
5543-27761-0048 NO MADAM SAID FIDOS AS SHE GESTICULATED WITH HER HANDS TO REASSURE HER MISTRESS AND TO MAKE HER SIT DOWN
5543-27761-0049 LUDCHKA'S ASLEEP MAY GOD BE WITH HER
5543-27761-0050 ONLY I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING YOU SEE LULETSKA IS ALWAYS HIDING HERSELF THAT IS NOT GOOD
5543-27761-0051 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BAD IT IS SAID FEDOSIA AND HER FACE EXPRESSED A MOST DECIDED CONFIDENCE
5543-27761-0052 I UNDERSTAND NOTHING IN WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
5543-27761-0053 YOU SEE MADAME IT'S A KIND OF OMEN EXPLAINS FEDOYA ABRUPTLY IN A SHAMEFACED WAY
5543-27761-0054 NONSENSE SAID SORAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0055 WHO TOLD YOU ALL THIS ASKED SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA IN AN AUSTERE SLOW VOICE
5543-27761-0056 KNOWS EXCLAIMED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA IN IRRITATION AS THOUGH SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HERSELF SOMEHOW FROM HIS SUDDEN ANXIETY
5543-27761-0057 WHAT NONSENSE AS THOUGH LUDETCHKA COULD DIE
5543-27761-0058 SHE SAW CLEARLY THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN A CHILD'S QUITE ORDINARY DIVERSION AND A CONTINUATION OF THE CHILD'S LIFE
5543-27761-0059 SHE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT THAT EVENING TO OCCUPY HER MIND WITH OTHER MATTERS BUT HER THOUGHTS TURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO THE FACT THAT LU LETCHKA LOVED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0060 WHEN LULOTCHKA WAS STILL QUITE SMALL AND HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HER NURSE SHE SOMETIMES SITTING IN HER NURSE'S ARMS MADE A SUDDEN ROGUISH GRIMACE AND HID HER LAUGHING FACE IN THE NURSE'S SHOULDER
5543-27761-0061 THEN SHE WOULD LOOK OUT WITH SLY GLANCE
5543-27761-0062 THOUGH SHE REPROACHED HERSELF AT ONCE FOR THIS UNFOUNDED SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD NOT ENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF LAETCHKA'S FAVORITE GAME AND SHE TRIED TO DIVERT LAETCHKA'S ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0063 SHE EAGERLY COMPLIED WITH HIS MOTHER'S NEW WISHES
5543-27761-0064 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA TRIED DESPERATELY TO AMUSE LULETSHKA
5543-27761-0065 PERHAPS THOUGHT SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA SHE IS NOT AS STRONGLY DRAWN TO THE WORLD AS OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY MANY THINGS
5543-27761-0066 IF THIS IS SO IS IT NOT THE SIGN OF ORGANIC WEAKNESS
5543-27761-0067 SARAFIRA ALEXANDROVNA HERSELF BEGAN THE GAME ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH SHE PLAYED IT WITH A HEAVY HEART
5543-27761-0068 SHE MURMURED AS THOUGH COMMITTING AN EVIL DEED WITH FULL CONSCIOUSNESS
5543-27761-0069 IT WAS A BAD DAY FOR SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0070 THE MOTHER COVERED HER WITH A BLUE BLANKET
5543-27761-0071 LUDUTZKA DREW HER SWEET LITTLE HANDS FROM UNDER THE BLANKET AND STRETCHED THEM OUT TO EMBRACE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER BENT DOWN
5543-27761-0072 SHE LOOKED SO SMALL AND SO FRAIL UNDER THE BLANKET THAT COVERED HER
5543-27761-0073 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA REMAINED STANDING OVER LUETCHKA'S BED A LONG WHILE AND SHE KEPT LOOKING AT LUETCHKA WITH TENDERNESS AND FEAR
5543-27761-0074 I'M A MOTHER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT HER SHE THOUGHT AS SHE IMAGINED THE VARIOUS ILLS THAT MIGHT BEFALL OLATSHKA
5543-27761-0075 SHE PRAYED LONG THAT NIGHT BUT THE PRAYER DID NOT REMOVE HER SADNESS
5543-27761-0076 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED LULETSHKA CAUGHT COLD
5543-27761-0077 THE FEVER CAME UPON HER TO NIGHT
5543-27761-0078 WHEN SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA AWAKENED BY FEDOSYA CAME TO LAOLETCHKA AND SAW HER LOOKING SO HOT SO RESTLESS AND SO TORMENTED SHE INSTANTLY RECALLED THE EVIL OMEN AND A HOPELESS DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS
5543-27761-0079 A DOCTOR WAS CALLED AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS BUT THE INEVITABLE HAPPENING
5543-27761-0080 AND LULETSKA GREW FEEBLER FROM HOUR TO HOUR
5543-27761-0081 NOTHING MADE HER SO UNHAPPY AS THE REITERATIONS OF FEDOSYA UTTERED BETWEEN SOBS SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF AROOECHKA
5543-27761-0082 FEVER WAS CONSUMING LOLLETCHKA AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND SPOKE IN DELIRIUM
5543-27761-0083 THIRTY DAYS PASSED TORTURING LIKE A NIGHTMARE
5543-27761-0084 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA HID HER FACE BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR LULETZKA'S BED HOW TRAGIC
5543-27761-0085 AWAIT MAMOTCHKA WHISPERED LULUTSHKA
5543-27761-0086 MOMOTKA'S WHITE FACE BECAME BLURRED AND EVERYTHING GREW DARK BEFORE LULLETSHKA
5543-27761-0087 SHE MET THE HUSBAND
5543-27761-0088 SARAFIAS ALEXANDROVNA WAS STANDING BY THE COFFIN AND LOOKING DULLY AT HER DEAD CHILD
5543-27761-0089 SINA MY DEAR DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF SAID SERGEY MOLOSTOVITCH IN A WHISPER
5543-27761-0090 YOU MUST RESIGN YOURSELF TO HER FATE
5543-27761-0091 SHE'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE PERSISTED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA HER EYE FIXED ON THE DEAD LITTLE GIRL
5543-27761-0092 SERGEY MOROTOVITCH LOOKED ROUND HIM CAUTIOUSLY HE WAS AFRAID OF THE UNSEEMLY AND OF THE RIDICULOUS
5543-27761-0093 LIMA DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF HE REPEATED
5543-27761-0094 HE WAS CONVINCED AND ANNOYED
5543-27761-0095 HER FACE SEEMED TRANQUIL AND HER EYES WERE DARK
5543-27761-0096 SHE WENT INTO THE NURSERY AND BEGAN TO WALK ROUND THE ROOM LOOKING INTO THOSE PLACES WHERE LULLETTECHKA USED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0097 SHE WALKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND BENT NOW AND THEN TO LOOK UNDER THE TABLE OR UNDER THE BED AND KEPT ON REPEATING CHEERFULLY WHERE'S MY LITTLE ONE WHERE IS MY ALETCHKA
5543-27761-0098 AFTER SHE HAD WALKED ROUND THE ROOM ONCE SHE BEGAN TO MAKE HER COURSE ANEW
5543-27761-0099 FEDOSYA MOTIONLESS WITH DEJECTED FACE SAT IN A CORNER AND LOOKED FRIGHTENED AT HER MISTRESS THEN SHE SUDDENLY BURST OUT SOBBING SHE WAILED LOUDLY
5543-27761-0100 SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LUOLETCHKA AN ANGELIC LITTLE SOUL
5543-27761-0101 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOR THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE BETWEEN HER AND LUTSKA
5543-27761-0102 THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF HEAVINESS IN SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA'S HEAD AS SHE APPROACHED LULLOTCHKA
5543-27761-0103 LUDUKA LAY THERE STILL AND PALE AND SMILED PATHETICALLY
5543-27761-0104 THE LITTLE ONE DO NOT REPLY
5543-27761-0105 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA STOOD UP ERECT SIGHED IN A LOST WAY SMILED AND CALLED LOUDLY LUETTECHKA
5543-27761-0106 LO LETCHKA IS BEING CARRIED OUT
5849-50873-0000 CAP'N BILL THE COMMANDER OF THE SMALL GARRISON AT SEBROOK PERMITTED HIM TO LAND BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO READ HIS COMMISSION BILL ORDERED HIM TO BE SILENT
5849-50873-0001 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MISTER PRINCE WADSWORTH ASKED FOR HE COULD SEE THAT THE MAN WAS GREATLY EXCITED GOVERNOR ANDROKE HAS COME AGAIN GASPED MISTER PRINCE WHY SHOULD THAT ALARM US THE FELLOW THOUGH GIVEN TO BOASTING IS NOT DANGEROUS OR LIABLE TO PUT HIS THREATS INTO EXECUTION BUT HE HAS GROWN DANGEROUS DECLARED MISTER PRINCE THE LIBERTIES OF THE COLONY ARE INVOLVED
5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH GREW A LITTLE UNEASY THOUGH HE WAS STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THE MATTER LIGHTLY
5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT AS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR POLITICAL RIGHTS
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VICIROY HAS COME TO HARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WADWORTH BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD DECLARED HE SHALL NOT HAVE IT
5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN A DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO AID THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE HALL HE PAUSED AND ASKED
5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THAT ASSEMBLY DOING ENGAGED IN A DEBATE
5849-50873-0010 AND WILL YOU WAIT UNTIL IT IS ENDED HE HAS PROMISED TO DO SO
5849-50873-0011 MISTER PRINCE FIXED HIS AMAZED EYES ON THE CAPTAIN'S FACE AND READ THERE OF DESPERATE DETERMINATION CAPTAIN HE BEGAN
5849-50873-0012 MISTER PRINCE BOWED AND INSTANTLY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE THE ASSEMBLY WAS IN SESSION
5849-50873-0013 AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE CHARLES STEVENS SAYS
5849-50873-0014 YES CHARLES IT WILL ANSWER WHAT DO YOU MEAN UNCLE
5849-50873-0015 NEVER DID DEBATERS TAKE BETTER INTEREST IN A MINOR SUBJECT
5849-50873-0016 WHAT DO YOU INTEND DOING UNCLE WILL YOU FIGHT ME
5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE AT THE TIME NOT TOO SOON NOR TOO LATE
5849-50873-0018 THE SUN WAS SETTING IN THE CAPTAIN SAID
5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO THE ENEMY
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS FOR I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR MISSION
5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PLACE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN BOSWORTH
5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT AS CLOSE TO THAT LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING SPECIAL ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE IN TWO SET ON A SHELF OF THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES WHEN HE SAW A MAN STATIONED NEAR THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THAT WINDOW THE FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOWED US AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SHE SEIZED HIS ARM
5849-50873-0028 PRAY HAVE A CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN THE CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WADSWORTH THE TRAINS VANCE CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 THERE IS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HAVE THE TRAINBANDS IN CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
5849-50873-0032 WHOM OF YOU HAS THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY REPLIED THE ENRAGED GOVERNOR
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY SHOOK HIS HEADS
5849-50873-0035 WE DO NOT KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT LIVE IN CONNECTICUT WHERE DOES HE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL ATTENDANT DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THIS DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARDS KNOWN AS THE CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUITS EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER TO THE SEIZURE OF THE CHARTERS WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN THE ASSEMBLY OF RHODE ISLAND SENT A MOST LOYAL ADDRESS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMALLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE CANNON WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE FORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THEIR DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THEIR FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTER TO THE EXPULSION OF ANDRO
5849-50962-0000 CALLED BERT WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUSH DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE
5849-50962-0001 IT'S A SCHOONER SAID MISTER BINGHAM TO MISTER MINTURN AN SHE HAS A VERY HEAVY CARGO
5849-50962-0002 TO THIS CORD WAS FIXED A HEAVY ROPE OR CABLE

5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BERT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AN THE BREECHES BUOY WILL GO OUT ON THE PULLEY
5849-50962-0007 IT WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MOST OF THE WICKED STORM HAD PASSED
5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS AND WOMEN TO THE PORCH
5849-50962-0009 MISSUS BOBBSEY MISSUS MINTURN NELLIE AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND NAT WERE ALL THERE FLOSSIE AND FREDDIE BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINAH AND SUSAN
5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND BERT AND HAL TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY WOULD
5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BUOY WAS APPROACHING
5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER IT CAME UNTIL ONLY A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMEN ARE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFE GUARDS AND A MAN IN THE CORK BELT BANDED UP ON SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERY BODY GATHERED AROUND AND NELLIE WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT WAS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FALLING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DROWNED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM WHEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
5849-50962-0018 AND DO GEORGE BINGHAM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE BROTHER
5849-50962-0019 SAFE AND WELL CAME THE WELCOME ANSWERS
5849-50962-0020 I EXPECT OUR PRAYERS WERE HEARD LAST NIGHT
5849-50962-0021 HERE COMES ANOTHER MAN CRIED THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A BIG MAN DASHED ON THE SANDS
5849-50962-0022 BUT I DECLARE WE DID LAND ON A FRIENDLY SHORE
5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BINGHAM SAID THE LIFE SAVING WORK TURNED OUT TO BE A SOCIAL AFFAIR FOR IT WAS A GREAT TIME GREETING NELLIE'S FATHER AND HAL'S UNCLE
5849-50962-0024 AND HAL AND HIS WIFE TOO PUT IN NAN
5849-50962-0025 WHAT A MORNING THAT WAS A SUNSET BEACH
5849-50962-0026 I'M SO GLAD WE PRAYED SAID LITTLE FLOSSIE TO REDDY WHEN SHE HEARD THE GOOD NEWS
5849-50963-0000 A DELIGHTFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THE DREADFUL STORM
5849-50963-0001 AND EDWARD WAS SO HAPPY
5849-50963-0002 THE NEPTUNE THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THAT SAND BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROWBOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A SHIVER
5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT DELAYED THEM SO
5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EVERY LOG LOAD ON THE SCHOONER AND WE STARTED OFF
5849-50963-0006 I COUNTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VOYAGE ASKED MISTER BOBBSEY WHO WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 THE VALUE RETURNED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 WELL I'M A RICH MAN NOW AND SO WAS MY MATE MC GLAUGHLAN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WILL HAVE TAKEN US A LIFETIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN THIS YEAR
5849-50963-0011 MAYBE AUNT EMILY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON A SHOPPING TOUR SUGGESTED NAN
5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERKS REMOVE ALL THE TRUCKS FROM THE AISLES AND I GUESS EVERYTHING WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN
5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR WHICH THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FACED AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BYE TO YOU NELLIE TOLD DOROTHY AND NAN NEXT
5849-50964-0001 NO THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NAN
5849-50964-0002 YOU ARE QUITE RICH NOW WEREN'T YOU REMARKED DOROTHY
5849-50964-0003 AND DOROTHY WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S PROUD SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING TURKEY
5849-50964-0005 COME NELLIE CALL MISSUS MC GLAUGHLAN I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAT
5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NELLIE TOLD HER
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN HE CAN TAKE US THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MUCH OF EM I GUESS ANSWERED BERT
5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD VACATION AND I M WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED NON VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN MADDY AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNEY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT
5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT THEIR VACATION
6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR CALL IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DOSTOYEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF SORROW
6123-59150-0003 CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS A MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL LOVER
6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN SILENCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE COST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE TO NEKHLUDOFF IN RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MAD HOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE ADIOS
6123-59150-0009 THE ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
6123-59150-0010 EVEN THE TALKING IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HANDS BUT WITH THE SUCK
6123-59150-0012 BUT HE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS BROTHER HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROTECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ENNA CARRENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHISE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEEDS THE CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE LIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST HAS AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
6123-59150-0019 IT INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES
6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BREAKING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE BETRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE OLDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS
6123-59150-0022 SERVE ME RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME DOWN AND KILL HIM
6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECAME A POPULAR AUTHOR
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT SENTIMENTS UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
6123-59150-0026 DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW EM ALL IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFFIEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEOKONSKI AGLEA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VAYA FERUSHENKO NASTASYA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL IVOLGAN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRONG OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES A DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS A DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE WHICH HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MEN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPPOSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUOUS CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CEREVOS
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKI IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN CONFESSION
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE AMISHKIN IN THE IDIOT
6123-59150-0040 THIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
6123-59150-0041 THE LOVERS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUGUEY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE HIS PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF THE OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS THE PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS
6123-59150-0046 IT HAS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS
6123-59186-0000 IT IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND MORNING
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDE IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS BUT IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THUS HE WRITES IN I FOUND HIM OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN WAS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 AND PROSE INTRUDE IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THAT SAME POEM ABOUT
6123-59186-0008 WHERE WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 CATERING THERE IS AN APPALLING PHRASE
6123-59186-0010 IS THAT LINE OF GOOD POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THEN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUIT MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 IT HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME WHICH MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF PROMISE THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES
6123-59186-0016 HIS WORLD IS A PALACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO BE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDING'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWING COLD TO ME COULD ALONE WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY
6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THAT FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDLEY'S POEMS THE OXEN
6123-59186-0022 WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STORY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THERE
6123-59186-0023 THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDLEY'S PREVAILING MOOD
6123-59186-0024 HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THAT SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY
6123-59186-0025 HOW LONG HE CRIES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEAR AGO
6123-59186-0026 WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORNED TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS AND CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS
6123-59186-0027 BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION AS SENIOR SOLDIERS FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE
6123-59186-0028 THE GENERAL HELL HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES
6123-59186-0029 SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEN NEW LOVES
6123-59186-0030 AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY THEY ON OUR DEEDS
6123-59186-0031 MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF HUMANITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR
6123-59186-0032 THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDEE IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE
6123-59186-0033 IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDE'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE
6123-59186-0034 FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES ON BOTH
6123-59186-0035 HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS ROUSED IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY
6123-59186-0036 LOVERS HAVE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH
6123-59186-0037 IN BEYOND THE LAST LAP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE
6123-59186-0038 NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL DOWN TO YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES
6123-59186-0039 AND THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN
6123-59186-0040 NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSELESS BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYS
6267-53049-0000 IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER DOESN'T IT
6267-53049-0001 PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE OULDER SISTER WISTFULLY
6267-53049-0002 DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY
6267-53049-0003 SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE ALTHOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMIRED IT FOR THE WORLD
6267-53049-0004 SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO TAKE A NEW DRESS
6267-53049-0005 DORIS HUNTER I THINK IT'S AN OLD QUILT
6267-53049-0006 YES PENELOPE MY DEAR DORIS
6267-53049-0007 LOVE TO PENNILOUP AND YOURSELF
6267-53049-0008 OUR AFFECTIONATE AUNT ADELA HUNTER
6267-53049-0009 I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A GRAND
6267-53049-0010 IT MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL FADED NOW
6267-53049-0011 TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIR LOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRAND MOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN
6267-53049-0012 IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELA TO SELL IT SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY
6267-53049-0013 WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT ANSWERED PENELOPE
6267-53049-0014 WHAT LOVELY OLD TIMEY STUFF AND NOT A BIT
6267-53049-0015 I DECLARE THIS IS AS GOOD AS NEW
6267-53049-0016 WELL LET US GO AND HAVE CHEAT SAID PENELOPE I WAS DECIDEDLY HUNGRY
6267-53049-0017 BESIDES I SEE THE POVERTY DOCKER COMING
6267-53049-0018 IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSES AN HEIR LOOM AFTER ALL
6267-53049-0019 PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT ON HER TRIUMPHANTLY IN THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS THE POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET
6267-53049-0020 SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER ADDRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE
6267-53049-0021 PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER SURPRISING
6267-53049-0022 SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
6267-53049-0023 MY AUNT ADELA GAVE ME GAVE US THIS MATERIAL SHE STAMMERED
6267-53049-0024 I'M NAMED AFTER HER MISS FAIRWATER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVELY OLD FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND TENDERNESS
6267-53049-0025 THEN YOU ARE MY GRAND NIECES SHE SAID
6267-53049-0026 WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT ROSEBUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN THIBET
6267-53049-0027 PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS FOR WE WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER
6267-53049-0028 SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSE ALL WAS BROKEN UP
6267-53049-0029 MY DEAR I AM A VERY LONELY LITTLE WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME
6267-53049-0030 NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FARMORE'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY
6267-53049-0031 DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS CHANGED IN A TWINED CLING OF AN EYE
6267-53049-0032 WHEN MISSUS WETHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
6267-65525-0000 AS SHE SLIPPED INTO THE BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW
6267-65525-0001 AUNT JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BABY CLANGING WITH THE OTHER
6267-65525-0002 SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND VULGAR AS A SUNFLOWER WITH AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS
6267-65525-0003 I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BIGGSBY IS THIS EVENING LIDDY AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK
6267-65525-0004 SYDNEY SMILED AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS FOR THE BABY
6267-65525-0005 ALL HER IDEAS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
6267-65525-0006 BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTERS
6267-65525-0007 THE ROOM WAS SMALL A FAIR BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SYDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS
6267-65525-0008 HER BED IN THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE
6267-65525-0009 JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A B AND THE MOUTH ZIG ZAGGED FROM EAR TO EAR
6267-65525-0010 SYDNEY HATED THAT MIRROR AS VIRULENTLY AS HE COULD HATE ANYTHING
6267-65525-0011 HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SYDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME IN THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THE DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID
6267-65525-0012 SHE BEGAN TO WRITE WITH A FLUSH OF REAL EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE
6267-65525-0013 ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO ELLEN DOUGLAS AND THAT WAS FORWARDED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFFERING EDITOR OF THE MAPPEL LEAF
6267-65525-0014 HE WROTE THAT ALTHOUGH HIS AGE DISTURBED HIM FROM MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB HE WAS TWENTY AND THE LIMIT WAS EIGHTEEN HE READ THE LETTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH MUCH INTEREST AND OFTEN HAD THOUGHT OF ANSWERING SOME OF THE REQUESTS FOR CORRESPONDENTS
6267-65525-0015 SHE NEVER HAD DONE SO BUT ELLEN DOUGLAS'S LETTER WAS SO INTERESTING THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO WRITE TO HER
6267-65525-0016 WOULD SHE BE GOOD ENOUGH TO CORRESPOND WITH HIM
6267-65525-0017 HE WAS TWO YEARS OUT FROM THE EAST AND HAS NOT YET FORGOTTEN TO BE HOMESICK AT TIMES
6267-65525-0018 SYDNEY LIKED THE LETTER AND UNDERSTOOD IT
6267-65525-0019 SHE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET JOHN LINCOLN NOR DO SHE WISH TO DO SO
6267-65525-0020 ON THE CORRESPONDENCE ITSELF SHE FOUND HER PLEASURE
6267-65525-0021 JOHN LINCOLN WROTE BREEZY ACCOUNTS OF RANGE LIFE AND ADVENTURES ON THE FAR WESTERN PLAINS SO ALIEN AND REMOTE FROM SNUG HUMDRUM PLAINFIELD LIFE THAT SYDNEY ALWAYS HAD THE SENSATION OF CROSSING A GULF WHEN SHE OPENED A LETTER FROM THE BAR AND AS FOR SYDNEY'S OWN LETTER THIS IS THE WAY IT RAN AS SHE WROTE IT
6267-65525-0022 THE EVERGREENS PLAINVILLE DEAR MISTER LINCOLN
6267-65525-0023 I LOVE LIFE AND ITS BLOOM AND BRILLIANCY I LOVE MEETING NEW PEOPLE I LOVE THE RIPPLE OF MUSIC THE HUM OF LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATIONS
6267-65525-0024 THAT MAN I HAD BEEN TALKING WITH WAS PAUL MOORE THE GREAT NOVELIST
6267-65525-0025 AS IT WAS I HAD CONTRADICTED HIM TWICE AND HE HAD LAUGHED AND LIKED IT BUT HIS BOOKS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A NEW MEANING TO ME HENCEFORTH TO THE INSIGHT HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN ME
6267-65525-0026 IT IS SUCH MEETINGS AS THESE THAT GIVE LIFE IT SPARKLE FOR ME
6267-65525-0027 HE WILL BE WEARY OF MY RHAPSODIES OVER HER
6267-65525-0028 SHE HAS SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR MY EVERY MODE
6267-65525-0029 YOURS SINCERELY SYDNEY WOOD
6267-65525-0030 OLD JANE CAME HOME PRESENTLY AND CARRIED AWAY HER SLEEPING BABY SYDNEY SAID HER PRAYERS WENT TO BED AND SLEPT SOUNDLY AND SERENNILY SHE MAILED HER LETTER THE NEXT DAY AND A MOMENT LATER AN ANSWER CAME
6267-65525-0031 SYDNEY DID NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT BUT DOZED RESTLESSLY ABOUT OR SIGHED IN HER PILLOW
6267-65525-0032 THE YOUNG WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD
6267-65525-0033 SYDNEY TROD THE WAY OF THE TRANSGRESSOR AND FOUND IT ITS THORNS PURSED TO BONE AND MARROW
6267-65525-0034 YOU SEE THAT ROAD OUT THERE
6267-65525-0035 AND THERE WAS NO HARBOR OR GLIMPSE OF SEA VISIBLE
6267-65525-0036 HAD THE HALTER KEEPER MAKE A MISTAKE
6267-65525-0037 THIS IS HIS PLACE NOBODY CALLS HIM THE EVERGREEN BUT MYSELF
6267-65525-0038 I DON'T UNDERSTAND HE SAYS PERPLEXEDLY
6267-65525-0039 OH SYDNEY THREW OUT HER HANDS IN THE BURST OF PASSIONATE PROTEST
6267-65525-0040 NO THEN YOU NEVER WILL UNDERSTAND I CAN'T MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
6267-65525-0041 EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT AND MY LIFE WAS JUST REMARKABLE
6267-65525-0042 THEN WHY DID YOU GET THEM HE ASKED BLANKLY

6599-38590-0006 GIVE IT ME OR RETURN AS THOU HAST
6599-38590-0007 I AM VERY WILLING SAID THE KING LET HIM HAVE IT
6599-38590-0008 THE PIECE OF CAMBRE WAS CALLED THE LADIES PIECE IN HONOR OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO HAD NEGOTIATED IT THOUGH MORALLY DIFFERENT AND OF VERY UNEQUAL WORTH THEY BOTH HAD MINDS OF A RARE ORDER AND TRAINED TO RECOGNISE POLITICAL NECESSITIES AND NOT TO ATTEMPT ANY BUT POSSIBLE SUCCESSES
6599-38590-0009 ALL THE GREAT PHYSICAL ACTORS SEEMED HURRYING AWAY FROM THE STAGE AS IF THE DRAMA WERE APPROACHING ITS END
6599-38591-0000 IN FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO AT THE BATTLE OF DREU HE WAS AGED AND SO ILL THAT NONE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM ON HORSEBACK
6599-38591-0001 HE FULLY ARMED SAVE ONLY HIS HEAD ANSWERED HIM RIGHT WELL SIR THIS IS THE REAL MEDICINE THAT HATH CURED ME FOR THE BATTLE WHICH IS TOWARD AND OF PREPARING FOR THE HONOUR OF GOD IN OUR CAMP
6599-38591-0002 THE KING'S PEACE CONCLUDED AT CAMBRAI IN FIFTEEN TWENTY NINE LASTED UP TO FIFTEEN THIRTY SIX INCESSANTLY TROUBLED HOWEVER BY FAR FROM PACIFIC SYMPTOMS PROCEEDINGS AND PREPARATIONS
6599-38591-0003 AT LAST I DECIDED UPON RETREATING
6599-38591-0004 IT WAS GARSLASO DE LA VEGA THE PRINCE OF SPANISH POESY THE SPANISH PETRARCH ACCORDING TO HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN
6599-38591-0005 MONTMORENCY SIGNED A SIMILAR ONE FOR PISMA
6599-38591-0006 THEY ALL REPAIRED TOGETHER TO THE HOUSE PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND AFTER DINNER THE EMPEROR BEING TIRED LAY DOWN TO REST ON A COUCH QUEEN ELEANOR BEFORE LONG CAME AND TAPPED AT HIS DOOR AND SENT WORD TO THE KING THAT THE EMPEROR WAS AWAKE
6599-38591-0007 FRANCES WITH THE CARDINAL DE LORRAINE AND THE CONSTABLE DU MONTMORENCY SOON ARRIVED
6599-38591-0008 ON ENTERING THE CHAMBER HE FOUND THE EMPEROR LYING DOWN AND CHATTING WITH HIS SISTER THE QUEEN WHO WAS SEATED BESIDE HIM ON A CHAIR
6599-38591-0009 YES SAYS CHARLES I HAD MADE SUCH CHEER THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SLEEP IT OFF
6599-38591-0010 FRANCIS DID THE CONVERSE WITH HIS OWN CAUTION
6599-38591-0011 ONLY SEVEN OF THE ATTENDANTS REMAINED IN THE EMPEROR'S CHAMBER AND THERE THE TWO SOVEREIGNS CONVERSED FOR AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THEY REMOVED TO THE HALL WHERE A SPLENDID SUPPER AWAITED THEM
6599-38591-0012 THE GENTILES PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE HAD RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ACCESSION
6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND GOT BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON'S SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S OL BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMUDA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDON CREWS WERE TO BRAND THE COWS WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST ARE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE SALT GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DARED GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANCE
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASED WOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILDING A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 THEY PUSHED OPEN THE WIDE GATE AND ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH THE SHEAF OF LONG J H STAMPING IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE BENCH SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTING TOGETHER
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED ALONG IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOOD AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOP STARTED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
6841-88291-0013 HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SET OVER IN ONE STRIP TO AVOID A TIGHTENED LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER CALF
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STARTED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULL DOGGES IMMEDIATELY POUNCE UPON THE VICTIM
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLUPPED OVER IN ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 THUS THE CALF WAS ABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKE YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULLDOGGERS
6841-88291-0021 MARK ER YELLED THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BRANDER PRESS THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF BLAIDED A LITTLE LESS THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRANDS SHOW CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOR TO INDICATE DUE PEELING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 AND HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOW TAIL ON THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNEASY TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDON
6841-88291-0027 UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT IMPOSSIBLE AND COULD SOME OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADOPT IT IN PREFERENCE
6841-88291-0028 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THE SPREAD OF THIS DOCTRINE TO ARIZONA
6841-88291-0029 IMAGINE A PUNCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TAGS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR ON A ROUND UP
6841-88291-0030 A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEASTING OR TO LOOKING IDLY ABOUT
6841-88291-0031 BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT GIVEN TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD OUR TEETH FILLED
6841-88291-0032 ONE OF THE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEGS BUT TOSSED HIS LOOP OVER ITS NECK
6841-88291-0033 MISTER FROST'S BULL CALF KNOWN IN PICTORIAL HISTORY SHOWS THE ATTITUDES
6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTELY MATTER OF FACT IMPERPUTABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER
6841-88291-0035 AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT ON PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HELD
6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD CATCH HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE FURIOUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING BACK TO THE UPRIGHT
6841-88291-0037 YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED THE NEXT
6841-88291-0038 THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME RUN IF IT FAILS
6841-88291-0039 BY NOW THE BANDON WAS IN FULL SWING
6841-88291-0040 WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARDS THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID THE CASTS FAIL
6841-88291-0041 THE MEN RAN TO AND FRO BUSY AND INTENT
6841-88291-0042 SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR SALVES WERE ON THE GROUND AT ONCE
6841-88291-0043 DUST ENDIED AND DISSIPATED
6841-88291-0044 NO MORE NECKED CALVES THEY ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0045 THEN HE WILL SPIT ON HIS HANDS AND GO AT IT ALONE
6841-88291-0046 IF LUCK HAD ATTENDED HIS FIRST EFFORT HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND THERE'S YOUR LITTLE CALF SAID HE
6841-88291-0047 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THAT FAR WITH YOUR LITTLE LOAD IRON
6841-88291-0048 TOWARD NOON THE WORK SLAPPED
6841-88291-0049 FINALLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMAN AND REPORTED THE BRANDY FINISHED
6841-88291-0050 THE LATTER COUNTED THE MARKS AND HIS TALLY BOOK
6841-88291-0051 ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX HE ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0052 THE BARKERS SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS TOLD OVER THE BITS OF EARS THEY HAD SAVED
6841-88291-0053 THAT TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
6841-88291-0054 FINALLY WOODTON DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HIP POCKET
6841-88291-0055 THEY HAD BEEN DOING AN WRESTLER'S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNING BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED
6841-88291-0056 I SAW ONCE IN A CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN'S AND THAT IT EXERCISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF THE BODY
6841-88294-0000 AT THIS MOMENT THE STEADY BEAT OF THE STORM ON THE ROOF CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EAVES
6841-88294-0001 WE HAVE EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKING OUT AT A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL
6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIPPING OF STEEL THROUGH CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN MY LEFT LEG
6841-88294-0003 THEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD PUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND
6841-88294-0004 IN PLACE OF IT HE THREW A SHARP STEEL HOOK
6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHIN HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD THAT DIDN'T SOUND GOOD
6841-88294-0006 WHEN A MAN BREATHES THAT WAY HE'S MOSTLY ALL
6841-88294-0007 MEN GOT BATTED ON THE HEAD OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
6841-88294-0008 SOUR WINE IS FINED TO PUT A WOUND IN SHAPE TO HEEL BUT IT'S NO SOOTHIN SYRUP
6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AN THEIR GRAVE IT WAS THE SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEA DONE ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBAREE
6841-88294-0010 IT FAIR MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH A BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE AND THE QUIET MOONLIGHT AND THE SHADOWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZONING EACH SIDE HIS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER THE RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO GET EM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AND PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP
6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN HE'D SING THAT BARBARY SONG UNTIL I'D GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWING BY JUST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DIED AND GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE'D JUST TALK
6841-88294-0013 HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND HE GAVE HIS SIGHT OF CONVERSATIONS PAUSING FOR REPLIES
6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THE HOUR BUT I NEVER MADE ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE'D COME FROM OR WHAT HE'D DONE
6841-88294-0015 I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HE IS QUIET
6841-88294-0016 USUALLY I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING FOR SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
6841-88294-0017 HE WAS LYING UPON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES HE ASKED VERY ANXIOUS
6841-88294-0019 ONE LITTLE SQUEEZES TALK ABOUT YOUR DEADLY WEAPONS
6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'D BEEN TOO SICK AND TOO LONG BED
6841-88294-0021 IN A MINUTE OR SO HE CAME TO IT
6841-88294-0022 OH YOU'RE A NICE SWEET PROPOSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
6841-88294-0023 THEY'RE SAFE ENOUGH LET ME HAVE THEM HE ADDED
6841-88294-0024 NOW LOOK HERE SAID I YOU CAN'T GET UP TO DATE YOU AIN'T FIT
6841-88294-0025 AND NO HE PLEADED BUT LET ME SEE THEM
6841-88294-0026 JUST TO SATISFY HIM I PASSED OVER HIS OLD DUD
6841-88294-0027 I'VE BEEN ROBBED I CRIED
6841-88294-0028 WHAT'S MY COAT HE ASKED
6841-88294-0029 YOU HAD NO COAT WHEN I PUSHED YOU UP I REPLIED
6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED AT ME SUSPICIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
6841-88294-0031 AFTER HE'D EATEN A FAIR DEAL HE FELL ASLEEP
6841-88294-0032 WHEN I CAME BACK THAT AFTERNOON THE BUNK WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE
6841-88294-0033 I WOULDN'T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR TWO DAYS
6841-88294-0034 THEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER QUITE A WAYS OFF
6841-88294-0035 GUESS HE'S SUSPICIOUS I STOLE THAT OLD COAT OF HIS THINKS I AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAS BEEN CORRECT
6841-88294-0036 HOWEVER HE DIDN'T STAY LONG IN A FRAME OF MIND
6841-88294-0037 I RAN ON PULLING MY GUN
6841-88294-0038 MEX WAS FLAT IN HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
6841-88294-0039 ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK SLEPT MY ONE ARMED FRIEND
6841-88294-0040 ANYWAY I THRUST THE MUZZLE OF MY COLT INTO THE SAILOR'S FACE WHAT'S THIS I SAID
6841-88294-0041 I WEEN HIM ET MONTE OF ANTONIO GERVAZ SAID HE
6841-88294-0042 THE GLEAM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SNARL FROM HIS LIPS
6841-88294-0043 IN ANY CASE HE FOLLOWED POCO PRONTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
6841-88294-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOSTLY DOING ODD JOBS I SAW HER OFF AND ON
6841-88294-0045 HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THE TIME ALMIGHTY BUSY HOLDIN DOWN MY CARD GAMES
6841-88294-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YE'D BETTER STAY RIGHT THERE
6841-88294-0047 I WANT TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE SAID SHE
6841-88294-0048 WHAT KIND OF GOOD THING I ASKED TREASURES SAID HE
6841-88294-0049 IT LOOKED ALL RIGHT ENOUGH NEITHER DRUNK NOR LOCO
6841-88294-0050 SIT DOWN SAID I OVER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE
6841-88294-0051 HE DID SO TO FAR AWAY SAID I
6841-88294-0052 AND IT'S A BIG THING SAID HANDY SOLOMON TO ME FOR IT'S NOT ONLY GOLD BUT ULTRA JEWELS AND DI'MONDS
6841-88294-0053 IT'LL MAKE US RICH AND A DOZEN LIKE US AND YOU CAN KISS THE BOOK ON THAT
6841-88294-0054 THAT MIGHT ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT WHY DO YOU TELL ME
6841-88294-0055 WHY DON'T YOU GET YOU TREASURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF DIVIDING IT
6841-88294-0056 WHY MAID HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAIN GRATITUDE
6841-88294-0057 DIDN'T YOU SAVE MY LIFE AN NUSS ME AN TAKE CARE OF ME WHEN I WAS NOT KILLED
6841-88294-0058 LOOK HERE ANDERSSON OR HANDY SOLOMON OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO CALL YOURSELF I REJOIN TO THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK STRAIGHT
6841-88294-0059 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO TAKE GRATITUDE BUT THAT DON'T GO WITH ME
6841-88294-0060 THE DEVIL'S A PREACHER IF HE AIN'T LOST YOUR PEN FEATHERS SAID HE

6841-88294-0064 WHY YES I ASKED WHY NOT HE RETORTED
6841-88294-0065 WE TALKED THE MATTER OVER AT LUNCH
6841-88294-0066 I STOOD OUT TO A LARGER PARTY
6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS AS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT I HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY WE COMPROMISED
6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THE TREASURE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WERE TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SCHEME DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
700-122866-0000 JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM AGAIN
700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLE IN EVERY DAY LIFE
700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARILLA DISAPPROVES OF ME
700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MUST GROW UP TO BE SENSIBLE YET
700-122866-0004 I JEST LAY AWAKE AND IMAGINED THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK TO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTS
700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAMME AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE THING THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY
700-122866-0007 THAT WINTER WEEKS SLIP BY

700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS A RED HAIR
700-122867-0012 YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR ANOTHER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
700-122867-0013 NOW THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER HAIR
700-122867-0014 AND SHIRLEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS THE WICKED THING TO DO
700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT IS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED ANNE
700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DAD UN
700-122867-0017 AND MISSUS ALLEN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANY ONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY WERE NOT
700-122867-0018 AND I HADN'T THEN AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY
700-122867-0019 WHO ASKED WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
700-122867-0020 OH I WOULDN'T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE
700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION IS IRRESISTIBLE
700-122867-0022 O MARILLA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTISE TO DECEIVE
700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKED LIKE THAT
700-122867-0024 WITH A LITTLE SIGH SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSORS
700-122867-0025 THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT A DREADFUL COLOR IS THERE
700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO WEEP ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT IF IT WON'T INTERFERE
700-122867-0027 IT SEEMED SUCH A STRANGE THING
700-122867-0028 ANNE WEPT AGAIN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
700-122867-0029 YES I SHALL TOO
700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS AND NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURLING
700-122867-0031 I SUSPECT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO MY NOSE NEXT
700-122867-0032 ANN'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER BELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCARY SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I DIDN'T
700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FEEL SO VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T IT
700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS BUT I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S RIGHT TO BE GOOD
700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISS ALLEN AND MISS STACY AND GROW UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU
700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON ROUND MY HEAD WITH THE BOW AT ONE SIDE
700-122867-0039 I SHALL CALL IT A SNOOD THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
700-122867-0040 MY HEAD'S BETTER NOW
700-122867-0041 I WAS TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH
700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE ANNE SAID ANNA
700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW THAT I CAN'T KEEP STILL
700-122868-0002 AND IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A RED HEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNE
700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS A LILY WOMAN
700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANNE'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATISED ELAINE
700-122868-0007 THOSE TIMES SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT
700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING AGAIN
700-122868-0009 THE BLACK SHELL HAVING BEEN PROCURED AND SPED IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE IS BORN
700-122868-0011 JEAN YOU ARRANGES
700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHES DEAD
700-122868-0013 JANES ROSE TO THE OCCASION
700-122868-0014 LEFT BEHIND AT THEIR LANDING
700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY HAD HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
700-122868-0016 THERE IS ONE CHANCE NOT ONE
700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWERY PRAYER
700-122868-0018 THE FLAT DRIFTED UNDER THE BREEZE AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MID STREAM
700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOW HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NO DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY ALL SEEMING LIKE AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAID
700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES FOR HER
700-122868-0023 THEN SHIRLEY
700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET HERE HE EXCLAIMED
700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES
700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED DAN
700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING OUT HIS OARS
700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT IN THE BARGE I MEAN THE PLOT
700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT TOM HESITATED
700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK SWEET LITTLE BEAT
700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WAY ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE
700-122868-0033 OR RIGHT
700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNE SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE NEITHER
700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLE BUT STILL
700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS INTO SCRAP
700-122868-0037 AN'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO DO
700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANNA GROANED MARILLA
700-122868-0039 I DON'T SAY HOW SAID JULIA
700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF A GREAT SHORTCOMING
7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT WAS DYING OF PAIN
7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IPSOPHYLICITAS SE NICITEMPERAT PREMATE EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAID THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND TO CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE IS SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVES FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXCELLENT OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THE SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS
7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIVES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ERECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR GREATER WEIGHT
7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLES AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAIN WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCES
7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE ILLS OF A LONG YEAR LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR
7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH THEM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOT YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PAY
7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THIS IMPIOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSE TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE HONORS DELAYED FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORWARD LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
7601-101622-0005 LET THE BEAST'S BLOOD STAIN THE INFAMOUS ARENA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND TO DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THE DEATH
7601-101622-0007 THE VERY GIRLS THEMSELVES SET THEM DOWN
7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING A REVOLT
7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARD THE FORTH
7601-175351-0002 LIGHT THY FIRES EXCLAIMED SOME
7601-175351-0003 WHAT FOR ASKED OTHERS
7601-175351-0004 AND STUFFING THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED WARREN
7601-175351-0005 DOES YOU HEAR ME
7601-175351-0006 AND WHO SPOKE CRIED HATTERAS
7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PENN ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CABIN
7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED KEN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FURTHER
7601-175351-0009 YOU SHAN'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WATER AND THEY SHAN'T LIGHT THE FIRES
7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN AND BOARDED
7601-175351-0011 HIS MURMUR WAS HEARD
7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOVER AND WARREN WENT ON TO HIS POST
7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERED WAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROW
7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BEHRING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWDED TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
7601-175351-0015 I'M BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WILL
7601-175351-0016 HATTERAS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEHIND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS AS APOCRYPHA
7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THIS LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NOT MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK BRAVING THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
7601-175351-0021 THERE IS MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO EDUCATE THEM I THINK
7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAWBONNY THOSE ANIMALS HAD NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
7601-175351-0023 YOU SUPPOSE THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED THEN
7601-175351-0024 I CERTAINLY WILL MISTER CLAWBONNY
7601-175351-0025 I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE ONE
7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRENELL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE HE GENERALLY GOES BY
7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITANNIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FOREMOST WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCYDIDES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HINTS WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE HER FAVOURITE THAT THIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE TRUE SUBJECTS TO THE HISTORIC PEN
7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATIONS OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EASILY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES
7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AND APOTHEGMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SPOLLIA OPINA
7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATUUS
7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OF COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHERCOCKS THAT TURNED AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONG HEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DIVER WHO CONSTANTLY DIVES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
7641-96252-0000 THUS WHEN DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT A MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS STILL THE SAME
7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE WERE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED WITH DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MIGHT DIE ON THE WHEEL AND ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE AND PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN ITS EXPRESSION
7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BELONGS TO A FLEETING AND ELUSIVE PHAENOMENON
7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN A SUFFERER
7641-96252-0008 BUT THE LATTER IS THE NECESSARY AND INTELLIGIBLE SYMPTOM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITE OF THE PAIN OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
7641-96252-0010 THIS GOOD MAN LIVES IN A WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL ONE YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND SERENITY OF DISPOSITION
7641-96252-0012 FOR THIS INTEREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE
7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALISE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO AUGHT OR LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
7641-96252-0015 FURTHER FROM THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERRING THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBERS OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTWEIGH THE REGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SOCRATES AND GIORDANO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTHS SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HAND OF THE PRIESTS
7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS APPARENTLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES OR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE
7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THEIR CAPACITY FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON IMAGINATION
7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER WHICH HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND LESS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THAT MAN A WISH FOR DELIVERANCE
7641-96670-0000 THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME IN THE SKY
7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SESASTRIS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF EA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN HER RISING AND SETTING
7641-96670-0002 MEDIA TOO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOONLIGHT
7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF KRETHEUS AND CRETHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMAS THEIR GRANDFATHER
7641-96670-0004 JASON SHOOK PELIAS AND TELAMON WITH HIM
7641-96670-0005 AS THEY CAME TO A CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHRIXUS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
7641-96670-0006 THE MISTS LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE VALLEY IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KINNAEUS LIVED WITH OBSYRTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDEA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS
7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDEIA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FASS
7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THERE COMES THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE
7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SARAMATII
7641-96670-0012 HE OF HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU
7641-96670-0013 ATDA'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
7641-96670-0014 AND THEN SPEAKING TO A KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID
7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAD THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE MARTYRS
7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAD MADE TRIAL OF YOU
7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO ARE SPEAKING WITH HIM
7641-96670-0019 SHE HAS A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
7641-96670-0020 KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ARRAS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS
7641-96670-0021 THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT THE TEETH OF A DRAGON
7641-96670-0022 IF YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE
7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO THROUGH MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE CROWD
7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS LAD AS IT IS
7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDIA GROW WHITE AS WITH FEAR
7641-96670-0027 PHRONTIS AND MEUS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
7641-96684-0000 BUT AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT EYES
7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER ADMETHEUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT VISION IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT IS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAD BEEN MINE OH APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMETUS
7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HER WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD USED IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS TO ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS AND MEDIUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY INTO THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SATE UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
7641-96684-0013 SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR
7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND TO GO WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN HE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
7641-96684-0016 ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
7641-96684-0017 THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ABOUT THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE SAME AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
7641-96684-0019 HOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP
7641-96684-0020 IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLY FOR HIM AS BEFORE
7641-96684-0021 AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FROM HER
7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR YE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PLACE
7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND SHE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
7641-96684-0025 NO MORE THE SPEECH CAME FROM HER
7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED IN WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD IS THAT SACRIFICE
7641-96684-0028 AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER LIFE WAS BEFORE HIM
7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED OUT FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE IN DEATH
7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
7641-96684-0032 HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMEBUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE CALLED BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM HERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE THE FEATURES
7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM TO BRING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY
7641-96684-0037 THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PAINS
7641-96684-0038 THEN ADMETUZ RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAD COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIR I HAVE COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION
7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME THERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR THE MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEANT
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND THE INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT
7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN WHAT IS THIS
7697-105815-0008 THEN YOU NEXT SAW A MAID COMING TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEMED MADE CLEAN AND LAID IT LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAUS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST RELEASED FROM THY SINS
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CROSS BLESSED TOMBS
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME INTO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE CAME YOU AND WHERE DO WE GO
7697-105815-0014 FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZIONS FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 KNOW YOU ARE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE UPON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID SHE NO DOUBT OF IT
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE'RE GETTING THAT ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS
7697-105815-0019 IS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS OURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A STREAM
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK IN IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST
7697-105815-0023 TIMORA SAID THAT TSUING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNOW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR A SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 WE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR A CROW
7697-105815-0028 OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHILE HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS BELIEF
7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN IN MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SATE DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAS GOT BACK HIS SCROW
7697-105815-0033 HE LAID IT UP ON THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLUMB THE HILL
7697-105815-0035 BUT THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRINGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HOLD AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS MY STRENGTH SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE COME HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PASS AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE A WATCHMAN DWELT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS I REST HERE TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHMAN TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITHIN UNTO THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0043 HAIGE COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU ASK IT OF ME
7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MONTHIAHN
7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I WILL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD
7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES
7697-105815-0048 CHARITY AND WHY DID YE NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME WITH THEM
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN WALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JAW BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAIN AND THE STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH
7697-105815-0052 THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANIS LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL OF YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THAT SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THIS YE SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE HE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HELPFULLY SAID CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SET OUT THROUGH THE FIELDS
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIENDS I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT'S FOR OUR GOOD
7697-105817-0008 CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOW STOP THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SAID J IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FORK
7697-105817-0011 AND BY THIS ACT WE CURE OUR SOUL AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 FOUR BECAUSE IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF SCIENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DESPAIRED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWAS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
7697-245712-0004 THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM THE POVERTY OF MEN AND OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS MADE IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF THE ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HATH ORDAINED ALL THIS
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD MADE THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
7697-245712-0009 SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIG MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN A SAFE INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATE MEN IN THAT STATE OF INNOCENCE
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEANED OVER PLANS
7697-245712-0013 NOW IT MEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN A PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNI HAVE BEEN STERILE
7697-245712-0015 THERE COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY
7697-245712-0016 IN EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER A MAN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CANNOT BE CALLED A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THAT STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF IGNORANCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST PERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WILL HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THIS STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAYS
8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU JEALOUS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY WE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON THEM
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENCE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKE MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN COULD INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT A HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE ASKED
8173-294714-0008 YOU KNEW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL YOURS
8173-294714-0009 WHAT WRONG ARE WE TALKING OF
8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND STILL
8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME WORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NONE THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT MY CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF WE HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A CONDITION AS MINE
8173-294714-0016 A CARELESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU OF MY FOOD AND SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE WAS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN AWAY
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE OUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THIS STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 NO WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 WHAT CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF IT
8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED BUT SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION FOR THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED A MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT ALMOST INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 BUT LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN
8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO BE YOUR ONLY FRIENDS
8173-294714-0031 AND YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HOUSE
8173-294714-0033 MAKING ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED DO YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAYS WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRANDT
8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBT I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY NEED YE HESITATE
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I SHALL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETIES
8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU A PLAIN TRUTH
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS NO SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE NEXT DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS CLEARLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE PERSON SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT A DIRECT INTEREST IN THE DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THIS ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO SEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS A MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
8173-294714-0048 YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN I REPEATED
8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER OUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY IN YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE
8173-294714-0051 YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SADLY
8173-294714-0052 WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYER
8173-294714-0053 THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHY AND EXPERIENCED AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
8173-294714-0054 CAUTIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSED MYSELF MY DELICACY TOOK THE ALARM
8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU OR MISTER VAN BRANDT SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY
8173-294714-0056 I WILL HONESTLY PROMISE THAT
8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM THEIR KNOWLEDGE THE COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO ALTHOUGH MY RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
8173-294714-0059 KISS ME SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU KNOW
8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY YOUR GOODNESS WHICH OVERPOWERS ME
8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR A JOURNEY
8254-115543-0001 EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF CONSIDERABLE ORDERS
8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING AND SUPPORTING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON
8254-115543-0003 THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION AND AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY
8254-115543-0004 BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER IN HER DULY DUCK A SORT OF A LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SOWN BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES
8254-115543-0005 BESIDES THE FAMILY THERE WERE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKING BESIDE A SLOW MOVING WAGON
8254-115543-0006 THE COCK TOO WENT WITH THEM
8254-115543-0007 GOOD BYE SHOUTED LITTLE KNALL FROM HIS GARDEN WHILE THEY WENT BY GOOD BYE
8254-115543-0008 THEY SHOUTED GREETINGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE POTTER AS THEY PASSED HIM AND ALSO TO THE OLD FAKIR SMEARED ALL OVER WITH ASHES WHO SAT IN A LITTLE BRICK HUT BY THE STREAM AND PRETENDED TO MAKE WONDERFUL CURES
8254-115543-0009 THIS IS MORE FUN THAN GOING TO SCHOOL SAID CULA AS THE OXEN PLODDED ALONG THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
8254-115543-0010 THESE BEAUTIFUL BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS RUN QUITE WILD
8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEADS WHICH HE OCCASIONALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS
8254-115543-0012 AS THE WAGON CAME UP A YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THE HOLY MAN RAN UP AND HELD OUT A BEGGING BOWL SAYING GIVE O CHARITABLE PEOPLE THIS HOLY ONE
8254-115543-0013 NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MUCH BEGGARS AS INDIA
8254-115543-0014 MANY OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THEM
8254-115543-0015 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEARER THEM
8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THEY'RE DOGS SAID MAHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CANE DOWN BY A STREAM
8254-115543-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN BUY SOME FROM THE MAN THERE HE IS NOW PLOWING BY THE STREAM SAID KOLA
8254-115543-0018 IT IS LOOKING FOR WATER SAID THE FARMER AS HE TOOK A LAST STOCK OF A CANE AND GENTLY GUIDED IT DOWN TO THE STREAM
8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS ANOTHER SACRED ANIMAL OF THE HINDOOS THEY WOULD NOT KILL OR INJURE ONE FOR ANYTHING
8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GREAT CROWD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD
8254-115543-0021 IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING IN STATE ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJA OR RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MODERN INDIA WAS FORMALLY MADE UP
8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT ALL DECORATED WITH PINK AND GOLD AND SILVER
8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS THE HOWDAH WHICH IS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS THE RAJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLORED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN
8254-115543-0024 BESIDE THE HOWDAH STOOD A SERVANT HOLDING A BIG UMBRELLA OF FINE FEATHERS OVER THE RAJAH'S HEAD
8254-115543-0025 THE DRIVERS SAT ON THE NECK OF THE ELEPHANT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST BY PRODDING HIM ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN IRON SHOD STICK OR GOAD
8254-115543-0026 IS N'T IT FINE TO RIDE LIKE THAT ON A BIG ELEPHANT
8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF THE DAY THE LITTLE FOLK TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE GRAND RAJA AND HIS ESCORT
8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS OR BARGAINING FOR FOOD AT THAT LITTLE BOOTH
8254-115543-0029 THESE THEY USE FOR PLATES HEAPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICE AND CURRY AND FISH AND ALL SORTS OF PUDDINGS AND SWEETS
8254-115543-0030 A SUPPER WAS BEING EATEN ANOTHER PARTY STOPPED AT THE ARRAL ENCAMPED NOT FAR AWAY
8254-115543-0031 WHEN THE LITTER WAS PUT DOWN A YOUNG WARRIOR STEPPED OUT LOOKING VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY
8254-115543-0032 HIS SERVANTS AT ONCE SPREAD A HANDSOME RUG ON THE GROUND FOR HIM TO SIT UPON AND RUSHED ABOUT WAITING ON HIM TAKING GOOD CARE TO KEEP EVERY ONE AT A DISTANCE
8254-115543-0033 YES AND NOW HE ORDERS EVERY ONE ABOUT HIM
8254-115543-0034 AROUND THE LITTLE BRAHMAN'S NECK WAS A THIN CORD OF THREAD WHICH IS THE SIGN OF HIS HIGH CASTE
8254-115543-0035 MEANWHILE THE HAUGHTY LITTLE BRAMIN ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HIS HEAD TURNED AWAY SO NO ONE COULD SEE HIM EAT AND THEN GROWING TIRED OF RESPECTFUL GLANCES AT THE CROWD AROUND HIM HE GOT INTO HIS LITTER AGAIN AND THE SERVANTS FASTENED THE CURTAINS TIGHTLY AROUND HIM
8254-115543-0036 EVERYBODY SLEPT SOUNDLY IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE SERVANTS WAS BEATING A DRUM MOST OF THE NIGHT WHICH THEY BELIEVED WAS A WAY TO KEEP OFF EVIL SPIRITS
8254-115543-0037 ALL THE THIEVES HE CRIED
8254-115543-0038 WE ARE AS BAD AS THE BEGGARS
