116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD THE BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WINDING OUR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREATER CORDIALITY
116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HEAD HE PRESSED MINE
116-288045-0003 AND WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SLIGHTLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FAMILY GUIDE
116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CONDUCTS THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
116-288045-0006 AN IDOL I WHISPERED TAKEN BY SURPRISE HE
116-288045-0007 THEIR WORSHIPPED GODS THAT DID NOT EXIST
116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVE THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAMORE IN MY BREAST
116-288045-0009 SO I SAID IN A LOW VOICE
116-288045-0010 HE WAS NO IDOL THEN AND NOT A GOD
116-288045-0011 IT MADE ATHENS A CITY OF LIGHT IT CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD SAYS OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT INTERRUPTED MY GUIDE WAS THAT
116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANSWER WOULD BE IT WAS NOT QUITE TRUE
116-288045-0014 PRODUCION
116-288045-0015 I WHISPERED TO MY SELF WHAT BLASPHEMY
116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNING THIS DIVINE APOLLO
116-288045-0017 DO DO YOU DOUBT HOMER
116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM YOU HOMER THE INSPIRED BARD
116-288045-0019 NO NO NOT APOLLO IS NOT AN IDOL
116-288045-0020 HE'S A GOD AND THE SON OF A GOD
116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN RELIGIOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE THE VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES
116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MIEN OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT THE PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTHDAY OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL SAVIOUR JESUS SON OF GOD
116-288045-0023 TO FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH A SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
116-288045-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS LIKE AN IDOL
116-288045-0025 IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH FOR APOLLO AND ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWERING TO HIS NAME AND DESCRIPTION
116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN GOING TOWARD HIM
116-288045-0027 WILL HE ONLY BE HERE THIS MORNING
116-288045-0028 WILL I NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN
116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HEAD TO CLASS HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER OR MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THE THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF AN IDOL AS APOLLO
116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY DOES NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHER
116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CANDIED DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE A ONE IN HAND THAN IN A MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY GIVE FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERY THING THAT IS WORTHY OF DEATH
116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN A DOGMA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE MUST NOT BUILD UP IS ANOTHER CRITICISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OR PRIEST IS THE MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTH IN A JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF THE STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING
116-288046-0007 WHEN BRITNEL LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIE OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THAT PRIEST
116-288046-0009 I WISH TO'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING
116-288046-0010 BUT FIRST LET US BE IMPERSONAL THE EPITHETS IRREVERENT BLASPHEMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG AT A MAN NOT FOR PITY BUT FROM ENVY
116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WATTING THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST ANIMATED BY THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BY CALLING HIM NAMES
116-288047-0000 A MYTH IS A FANCIFUL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENA
116-288047-0001 THIS MIND CRAVES FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN INBORN DESIRE TO KNOW
116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO SNAP INTO EACH OTHER
116-288047-0003 WITH THIS MARHOS THE PRIMITIVE MAN WAS SATISFIED UNTIL HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED ITS INADEQUACY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALIZATION
116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN INDIA HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THEIR HINDUS
116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH METHS HAVE BEEN PUT
116-288047-0006 IS JESUS A MYTHS
116-288047-0007 THERE IS AS IN MAN A FACULTY FOR FICTION
116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS WHEN IT GUESSES
116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BIT INTO THE MOUTH OF THAT IMAGINATION CURBING ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RELENTLESS SPIRIT
116-288047-0010 WE FEEL THE SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHERS INVISIBLE AND AIRY BEINGS
116-288047-0011 WE COVET THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOONS
116-288047-0012 OUR FEET DO NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE FINISHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT GONE UNTIL MAN HAD MATURED
116-288047-0014 HOW GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE
116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND THE FAITH OF MANKIND
116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL IS A BIRTHPLACE OF SCIENCE
116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SCIENCE OF THE FATHER
116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILDS MIND
116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTHPIECE AND THAT NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TO BE PRESENTABLE
116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THAT EVIDENCE
116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOUR FOR HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY
116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DATES WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES AT THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPELS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS GONE ON THAT DAY
116-288048-0002 IT IS DISCREPANCY IN THE HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HAROLD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT HIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS BY JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES
116-288048-0005 WELL IT IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH A DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR
116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN AND THE ZODIAC IN THE PHASES OF THE MOON
116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN AUSTRALIA HAS BECOME THE CHRISTIAN EASTERS
116-288048-0008 BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE OREGEN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SKEPTICAL CELSUS
116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MISTS OF THESE
116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE ONE HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW WHO WAS MASTER
116-288048-0012 WHO IS JOHN PETER JUDAS AND MARY
116-288048-0013 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT YOU EVER EXISTED
116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH THE NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE SENSE OF A MYTH
116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO FOLLOWED THEM
116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE ALWAYS EXCLUSIVELY
116-288048-0018 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
116-288048-0019 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN IN ANY CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
116-288048-0020 HOW ELSE HAD THIS UNANIMOUS SCIENCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONOURS SHOULD BE GIVEN THE VOTES
116-288048-0022 THEN SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BY THE SWORD NOW AND BY HELL FIRE HEREAFTER
116-288048-0023 YET EVEN THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JUDAS MOUTH
116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON THEIR ATTENTION
116-288048-0025 THEREFORE IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
116-288048-0026 IF THESE PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED
116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF DELUDED REPUBLICS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH MISERABLE PROMISES
116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH THE PREACHERS OF TO DAY GIVE HE PARRIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD SAW IT FOR OUR GOOD
116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I SHALL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SPOKE
116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IT IS A REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET TO OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR METEIA OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF
1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF NOTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFED ATMOSPHERE
1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED UP BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN AND
1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN IS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD WHAT
1255-138279-0008 TWO THREE SEVEN
1255-138279-0009 FOUR FIVE EIGHT
1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A THOUSAND YARDS
1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT HAD STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER
1255-138279-0012 THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARD THAT FIFTH WINDOW
1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MADLAND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL
1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW WAS STRUCK DOWN IN THE SAME MANNER
1255-138279-0015 THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY REDUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW
1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW CREMULOUSLY
1255-138279-0017 I ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVEN ME
1255-138279-0018 WILL I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
1255-138279-0019 I MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
1255-138279-0020 I HAVE HAD MONEY
1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WHERE THEN
1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I SHOULD
1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK AND
1255-138279-0024 GOOD NIGHT THANK GOOD NIGHT
1255-74899-0000 THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES THEN
1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNTESSES NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH THEY RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
1255-74899-0003 I COULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL WORKED FOR SOME DELAY
1255-74899-0005 IT WERE A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE TO THEM
1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT IN HIS OWN
1255-74899-0008 OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE A MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LOVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
1255-74899-0009 THEY ARE POLES ASUNDERS FROM ME HE SAID
1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WOULD ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE NAME OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT SEEM TO BE THEIR MASTER
1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE IN WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER THWAITE SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER IT
1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SICK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
1255-74899-0016 WITH IT THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
1255-74899-0017 AND IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN ALLS ME
1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY OF THE MORNING
1255-74899-0020 I'D SOONER SEE YOU DARNED MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEETHEARS
1255-74899-0021 I CAN DO THAT MUCH
1255-74899-0022 AND NOW YOU'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
1255-90407-0000 HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTO WAR TIME
1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE MOON GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT NOW HE INQUIRED
1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME BEFORE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT PRESENT
1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD YOU THINK SO
1255-90407-0006 HE'S MY OWN FATHER INDEED
1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS MORNING
1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER'S IS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY AND
1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE HE CHOSE
1255-90407-0010 YOU'VE HEARD MORE
1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS
1255-90407-0012 MY OWN FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
1255-90407-0013 WAS WHAT THIS EVENING
1255-90407-0014 THERE ARE THE NETS THEY SAT
1255-90407-0015 JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULANTS
1255-90407-0016 NO I SHALL GO OUT AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT
1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE SHE WON'T CARE TO STAY
1255-90407-0018 FOR THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL
1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL
1255-90407-0020 HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND THEY MADE NO OBJECTION
1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION AND
1255-90407-0022 HER APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS SO IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU OFF SOMETHING TO EAT
1255-90407-0025 HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT A SAME TIME
1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH A DIM ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT
1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PEARSON AND
1255-90407-0028 HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING HER WALK
1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GOT OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE
1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVVIES CARROW
1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES THEM
1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINEAVINE'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING WITH EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
1255-90413-0003 THOUGH THIS WAS NOT ALL
1255-90413-0004 BUT WAS HE UNABLE
1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESSES HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
1255-90413-0006 HE CONTINUED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
1255-90413-0007 SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE GREAT FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL PAOL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMON PLACE WORDS
1255-90413-0010 JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD HEIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT UP AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED
1255-90413-0011 SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREYISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE IN MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES OH THERE
1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE REMEMBERED IN SURPRISE
1255-90413-0015 IT IS AS RATHER UNCIVIL
1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OFF AS HE COULD
1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LORD CHANELCLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT
1255-90413-0018 JOSCELYN PIERSIDE
1255-90413-0019 OH DIDN'T HE MARRY HIM
1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINETAVAN WITH A START
1255-90413-0021 BUT JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH THE LONG STRIDES
1255-90413-0022 LADY ARRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMP LIGHT NICOLA PINE HAN
1255-90413-0023 FOR SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL
1255-90413-0024 AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR AN EATING AND DRINKING
1255-90413-0025 IT HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED FOR
1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS PASSING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF EVENTS COULD BE SEEN
1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF ITS INVENTOR IS HARD
1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESS FOR COSTS A PERSONAL SURRENDER
1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESOLVE IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OR MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGIS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVEALED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD IN IT SOME CHECK
1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THEIR ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSOLVEDISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE
1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN RIGHTENING FASTER
1585-131718-0007 YES THE VERY VOGUAL OF THE ELECTRIC ARC LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISES FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR STREET LINING
1585-131718-0009 THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRING THOUGHT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCES WAS INEVITABLE
1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NOT LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY APPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMPLE ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES AND THE LEADING STATES
1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER A STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE LAST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN
1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCLETE BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN IS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH A ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES
1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF SITTERS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THAT ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS AN IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF
1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WERE A PLENTY
1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH A ACTIVE ILL WILL
1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENIAL INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARY APATHETIC
1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SOMEDAM AND THE BALLASTON WATTGAGE
1585-131718-0023 WE SOLD THEM FOR THIRTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM
1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY OFF IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE ANCIENT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLUE WHERE TO DO IT
1585-131718-0027 I THEN MADE UP ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY
1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO EDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING IN A CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWERS
1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GORWICK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
1585-131718-0030 TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE PARADES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WORCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASKS OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMBERLESS OTHER DETAILS
1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLYD COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS
1585-131718-0032 THAT WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS THE PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE
1585-131718-0033 THE EXPERIENCE WITH A LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS ALSO STARTLING
1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A SENT
1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEE HIVE DAY AND DAY
1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARRINACLET OF THE CLERK
1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP ON MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEIGRES AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND OLD PAPER AND I CAN PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT
1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THEIR MATTER
1585-131718-0041 THEY DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1585-131718-0042 I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO BE NO NOTICE
1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMAE
1585-131718-0044 HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NOW ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN
1585-131718-0045 ONE NIGHT SHE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AS NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLINS
1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIREGREGATE
1585-131718-0048 HE WOULD GO UP AMONG THE FIRE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLERS DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN'S STORIES AT THE HARRISON LINEN FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS LAWING FIRST
1585-131718-0051 I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST HER COAT
1585-131718-0052 THEN THEY GOT PLEURACI AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE
1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF HANDING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS
1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED TO
1585-157660-0000 LONDON IS GOLF AND GLORY
1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MEN ARE MOUDED OUT OF THOUGHTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE HOUSE STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAMS STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UTTERED THE FOLLOWING ORRITORICAL FLIGHT
1585-157660-0003 GLORIOUS LONDONER
1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WON'T ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEATEN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION
1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHOR'S BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNING COUCHES
1585-157660-0006 WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE ENFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR THE NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THE SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD THE GLOWING EXPECTATIONS
1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPORTATION FOULTS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST HE PROMISES AND OFT HE HITS WHERE HOPES IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLITS
1585-157660-0009 DUSIS ONE DUBBER WHEN SIX IS TREBACOY
1585-157660-0010 WILLEM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CENOPOT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION
1585-157660-0011 THE POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE I WORD FOR IT
1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON HIS CASTE AND WILL WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE
1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BU' PAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP
1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD WALKED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCAL
1585-157660-0015 THE PREEN'S SHOP OF OWL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVERN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
1585-157660-0016 JAMES BURRIBRIDGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS BLUFF MANNER WHAT YOU KNOW
1630-102884-0000 IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME NOBLE AND INEFFECTUAL
1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE
1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE AS SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS
1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE APPARENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE VAST
1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY BUT A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL
1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION OF OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT
1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY ACQUIRED A CRUEL LOVE OF FREEDOM
1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT EPOCH OF THE SOUL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHABARA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF ENQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS ASSURED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH
1630-102884-0009 IT HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT CONTENTION
1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ODOUR WHICH PROVED ITS IRRESISTIBLE CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION
1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR IDLE FUNCTIONS
1630-102884-0012 BY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GRIP OF AN INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE AND TRUTH
1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING CELLS INTO A DEFINITE PASSIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEIR OWN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MASTERING THEIR OWN DESTINY
1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING OUR STEPS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY UNMOVABLE ONLY BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
1630-102884-0015 THEY MUST BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND OF FIGHTING IN FREEDOM'S CAUSE
1630-102884-0016 IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF INERTIA WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUTHS AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY BOTH WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND OUTSIDE
1630-141772-0000 ON THE BRADZEN HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAGSTAFF IN HIS HANDS LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND CHILD LIKE MOAN
1630-141772-0001 SUDDENLY HE AGAIN FELT THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BURNING LACERATING PAIN IN HIS HAIR
1630-141772-0002 WAS HIS FIRST THOUGHT NOW
1630-141772-0003 HE FEEBLY MOVED HIS LEG AND UTTERED A FIERCE SICKLY GROAN WHICH AROUSED HIS OWN PITY
1630-141772-0004 GIVE THIS YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TERRIBLE PAIN OF BEING LIFTED ON TO THE STRETCHER THE JOLTING WHILE BEING MOVED AND THE PROBING OF THE WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION
1630-141772-0006 DURING THIS TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN KEEP
1630-141772-0007 HE ASKED ON SEEING MY PRISONERS
1630-141772-0008 I COMMANDED AS SQUADRON REPLIED REPN
1630-141772-0009 PRINCE REPNIN NAMED LIEUTENANT SUC TELLEN
1630-141772-0010 AFTER ALL LOOKING AT HIM NAPOLEON SMILED
1630-141772-0011 YOUTH IS NO HINDRANCE TO COURAGE MUTTERED SUCQUEN IN A FAILING VOICE
1630-141772-0012 ' A SPLENDID REPLY SAID NAPOLEON
1630-141772-0013 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYES TO COMPLETE THE SHOW OF TREASURES COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHONE WITH THE SELF SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE
1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD ICORN PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER FATHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOUR THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY NOW HASTENED TO RETURN THE HOLY IMAGE
1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS RELEASED BUT THE LITTLE IKON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT UD BE TO KNOW WHERE TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER IT IN THE GRAVE
1630-141772-0018 HOW HAPPY AND CALM I SHOULD BE IF I COULD NOW SAY TO LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME
1630-141772-0019 EITHER TO A POWER INDEFINABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHICH I NOT ONLY CANNOT ADDRESS BUT WHICH I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS IN WORDS THE GREAT ALL OR NOTHING SAID HE TO HIMSELF OR TO THAT GOD WHO HATH BEEN SOWN INTO THIS AMULET BY MARY
1630-141772-0020 THE STEPERS MOVED ON
1630-141772-0021 THE QUIET HOME LIFE AND PEACEFUL HAPPINESS OF BAULD HILLS PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM
1630-141772-0022 KI IS A NERVOUS BILIOUS SUBJECT SAID LARRY AND WILL NOT RECOVER
1630-73710-0000 IT IS AT THE FOOT OF WOMEN THAT WE LAY THE LAURELS THAT WITHOUT HER SMILE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GAINED IT IS HER IMAGE THAT STRINGS THE LYRE OF THE POET THAT ANIMATES HER VOICE IN THE BLAZE OF ELOQUENT FACTION AND GUIDES HER BRAIN IN THE AUGUST TOILS OF STATELY COUNSELS
1630-73710-0001 IS THERE NO HOPE FOR THEM SO FULL OF HOPE AND
1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE BUT TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO HER IMAGINATION
1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCUR FLITS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OBSCURING ALL MY GAY FANCIES WITH ITS BAT LIKE WING AND TAINTING THE HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF HER HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPIRATIONS
1630-73710-0004 MINE OWN AND
1630-73710-0005 WHILE DEAD WHAT COULD YE DO
1630-73710-0006 I BET ABOUT MY CHAMBER LIKE A FELLY BIRD IN A CAGE
1630-73710-0007 DO NOT THINK OF MOVING TO TOWN
1630-73710-0008 DO NOT KEEP THE MESSENGER ONE INSTANT
1630-73710-0009 A KISS ON MY PONY
1630-73710-0010 WRITE ONLY ONE WORD TO YOUR OWN HENRIETTAS
1630-73710-0011 FODNAND TO HENRIETTA
1630-73710-0012 GOD BLESS YOU MY HENRIETTA MY BELOVED MY MATCHLESS HENRIETTA'
1630-73710-0013 WHAT HAS THAT SEPARATION BUT COST ME
1630-73710-0014 PANGS THAT I COULD NOT CONCEIVE ANY HUMAN MEMORY COULD OCCASION
1630-73710-0015 AND YET I' OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT HE WAS UNINJURED LAST NIGHT
1630-73710-0016 I DARE NOT NOW OWN HOW DIFFICULT I WAS
1630-73710-0017 DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOUR HENRIETTA BUT I'M NERVOUS ABOUT CONCEALING YOUR ENGAGEMENT FROM PAPA
1630-73710-0018 DAYS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE YOU CAN REACH BATH AND I KNOW FERDINAND I KNOW YOUR OFFICE'S MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WILL CONFESS
1630-73710-0019 BUT COME BACK YOUR OWN AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND WRITE TO ME AT THE POST OFFICE AS YOU'RE SETTLED
1630-73710-0020 THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YOU ARE SO NEAR MAKES ME RESTLESSLY
1630-73710-0021 I WISH TO MEET HIM WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS AS YOU CAN COMMAND
1630-96099-0000 THAT TIME SIR YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERTAKE
1630-96099-0001 THEN SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HE SAID SOME SPECIAL INFORMATION SOME GREAT NEWS
1630-96099-0002 WHEN BLOCO APPEARED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH HIM
1630-96099-0003 GONE NOW JEST WHEN WE MOST WARNED HIM NEVER
1630-96099-0004 ETIATE TRIPLE EDEATE
1630-96099-0005 YOU SHALL BE DISMISSED DISCHARGED FROM THE TSAR YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO THE FALSE
1630-96099-0006 IT IS THAT ONE YOUR GREAT GLUTTONY
1630-96099-0007 MY GENTLEMAN MADE HIMSELF THE MOST PLEASANT
1630-96099-0008 WELL AT ANY RATE FOR MY SINS I HAD ACCEPTED
1630-96099-0009 WE ENTERED THE FIRST RESTAURANT THAT OF THE REUNITED TRENTS YOU KNOW IT PERHAPS TO MONSIEUR
1630-96099-0010 I HAD NO FEAR OF IT NOT TILL THE VERY LAST WHEN HE PLAYED ME THIS EVIL TURN
1630-96099-0011 I SUSPECTED NOTHING WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT HIS POCKET BOOK IT WAS STUFFED FULL MESSIEURS I SAW THAT AND MY CONFERENCE INCREASED CALLED FOR A RECKONING AND PAID WITH AN ITALIAN BANK NOTE
1630-96099-0012 EXCUSED ME ONE MOMENT PRAY
1630-96099-0013 HE WENT OUT MESSIER AND PIFFEATH HE WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN
1630-96099-0014 WHY LET OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
1630-96099-0015 IT WAS ONLY NOW ON THE LEVINTH HOUR THAT THE ITALIAN HAD BECOME INCULPATED AND THE QUESTION OF HIS POSSIBLE ANXIETY TO ESCAPE HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED
1630-96099-0016 HE LEFT FIFTY BEHIND
1630-96099-0017 HAND IT TO ME SAID THE CHIEF AND WHEN IT CAME INTO ITS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES HURRIEDLY
1630-96099-0018 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND NOT MUCH MORE THAN A WORD HERE AND THERE
1630-96099-0019 IT IS NO DOUBT THAT ITALIAN
1630-96099-0020 OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF SHOULD NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OR OF MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE
1630-96099-0021 IT WAS A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED LIRAS A HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS HA
1630-96099-0022 HE WAS TOO MUCH PRESSED IN A GREAT HURRY
1630-96099-0023 DIRECTLY HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED THE ELDER
1630-96099-0024 HE USED TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT THEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CAB AND WERE DRIVEN AWAY TOGETHER
1650-157641-0000 THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARD WORKING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER WAS CURIOUS
1650-157641-0001 NOW MISS MISSUS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IN A SMOKING HUMOR AND SHALL PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHT
1650-157641-0002 BUT SAY IT WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU
1650-157641-0003 THE DWARF'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE CATHOLICICAL
1650-157641-0004 BUT QUILP AND BRASS WERE NOW IN AUTHORITY
1650-157641-0005 THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE OPONIENTS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO
1650-157641-0006 ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THE GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATES SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGARETTE SMOKING AMONG OFFICERS OF THE ARMY
1650-157641-0007 THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ODOUR OF TOBACCO AND THE DISTRUST THE MAN WHO SMOKED
1650-157641-0008 HERE IS FISTUDOS OR THACKERAY'S COMMENTS ON IT WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
1650-157641-0009 I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT THEY WOMEN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RIVAL
1650-157641-0010 I WOULD LAY A GUINEA THAT THE MANLY LADY WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I AM A SMOKER AND SAYS OH THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE
1650-157641-0011 GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR THREESCORE YEARS FRANCE SMOKES TO A MINUTE
1650-157641-0012 PSHAH LOOK TO HIS PROGRESS
1650-157641-0013 THIS THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
1650-157641-0014 THE JOURNALISTS AND THE BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THEIR COGERS WERE ABOUT WERE BELOW THE DIG TASTES OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS THE FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS
1650-157641-0015 BOTH QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE PRINCE CONSILOR DETESTED IT SO TOBACCO WAS TABOOS WHEREVER THE COURT WAS
1650-167613-0000 THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT THE PRINCE CONTINUED APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA
1650-167613-0001 SEAS WERE BROUGHT IN AND THE SOLE WAS THREE
1650-167613-0002 THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT THE PEER'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF THE MALUSICOTE AND THE POSITIONS OF OUR ARMY FROM WHICH HE HAD RIDDEN
1650-167613-0003 SO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TERMS
1650-167613-0004 NOW BEING A MILITARY MAN YOU CAN'T SAY I'VE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL POSITION
1650-167613-0005 WELL THEN YOU KNOW MORE THAN ANY ONE ONE ELSE BE IT WHO IT MAY SAID PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0006 AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BUCLAY DE TOLLY
1650-167613-0007 PURE LOOK AT MALCOLM WITH A CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH EVERYBODY INVOLUNTARILY ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER
1650-167613-0008 WE SEE LIGHT AGAIN SINCE HIS SERENITY HAS BEEN APPOINTED YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID MUGGIN TIMIDLY AND CONTINUALLY TURNING TO GLANCE AT HIS COLONEL
1650-167613-0009 QUITE SO ASK THE PEER
1650-167613-0010 BUT THEN WHY WAS IT FORBIDDEN
1650-167613-0011 AT SMOLENSK TOO HE HAD JUDGED CORRECTLY THAT THE FRENCH MIGHT OUTFLANK US AS THEY HAD LARGE FORCES
1650-167613-0012 HE ORDERED US TO RETREAT AND ALL OUR EFFORTS AND ALLOWANCES BEING FOR NOTHING
1650-167613-0013 SOWED THE ASPENS WITH BARQUELEY
1650-167613-0014 WELL RUSSIA WAS WELL A FOREIGNER COULD SERVE HER AND BE A SPLENDID MINISTER BUT AS SOON AS SHE IS IN DANGER SHE NEEDS ONE OF HER OWN KEEN
1650-167613-0015 AND THEY SAY HE IS A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REJOINED HE
1650-167613-0016 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MEANT BY A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED JOHN ANDREW IRONICALLY
1650-167613-0017 A SKILLFUL COMMANDER SAID THE PEER
1650-167613-0018 PURE LOOK AT THEM IN SURPRISE
1650-167613-0019 AND SO YET THEY SAY THAT THE WAR IS LIKE A GAME OF CHESS HE REMARKED
1650-167613-0020 THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF BODIES OF TROOP CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO ONE
1650-167613-0021 SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ON MATTERS AND THE LEAST OF ALL ON POSITION BUT ON WHAT THEN
1650-167613-0022 ON THE FEELING THAT IS IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMALKIN AND HE IS SOUSER
1650-167613-0023 A BATTLE IS WON BY THOSE WHO FAIRLY RESOLVE TO WIN IT
1650-167613-0024 WHY DID WE LOSE THE BATTLE AT THE OUSBOULS
1650-167613-0025 WE'VE LOUSED SO LET US RUN AND HE RUN
1650-167613-0026 BUT TO MORROW WE SHAN'T PAY IT
1650-167613-0027 BUT AND WHAT A WEIGHT HAS TO MORROW
1650-167613-0028 THE FACT IS THAT THOSE MEN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE RIDDEN ROUND THE POSITION NOT ONLY TO NOW HELP MATTERS BUT IN HINDER
1650-167613-0029 THAT'S THE TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH SAID PHILKIN

1650-167613-0034 IN MY OPINION THEY ARE ALL CRIMINAL'S
1650-167613-0035 AND SO THINKS TISALKI AND THE WHOLE ARMY
1650-167613-0036 SINCE THEY ARE MY FOES THEY CAN NOT BE MY FRIENDS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SAID AT THE TUSET
1650-167613-0037 YES YES MUTTERED PETER LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES AT A PRINCE ANDREW
1650-167613-0038 THEY TALKED TO US OF RULES OF WAR OF CHIVALRY OF FLAGS OF TRUTH OF MERCY TO THE UNFORTUNATE AND SO ON IT'S OUR RUBBISH
1650-167613-0039 THEY PLUNDER OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES ISHUFEL'S PAPER MONEY AND WORST OF ALL THEY KILL MY CHILDREN AND MY FATHER AND THEN TALK OF RULES OF WAR AND MAGNANIMITY TO FOALS
1650-167613-0040 TAKE NO PRISONERS BEFORE THE KEEL AND BE KILLED
1650-167613-0041 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD FELT IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER OR NOT MASSACRE WAS TAKEN AS MARMOLENSK HAD BEEN WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED IN HIS SPEECH BY AN UNEXPECTED CRAMMY HIS THROAT
1650-167613-0042 HE PACED UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES IN SILENCE BUT HIS EYES GLITTERED FEVERISHLY AND HIS LIPS QUIVERED WHEN HE BEGAN SPEAKING
1650-167613-0043 AND NO WHEN THERE WAS A WAR LIKE THIS ONE IT WOULD BE A WAR
1650-167613-0044 WHAT IS NEEDED FOR SOCIETY AND WARFARE
1650-167613-0045 AND IN SPITE OF ALL THIS IT IS OF THE HIGHEST CLASS RESPECTED BY EVERY ONE

1650-167613-0054 ONE PICTURED SUCCEEDED ANOTHER IN HIS IMAGINATION
1650-167613-0055 OR ONE OF THEM HE DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY
1650-173551-0000 HIS MAJOR DOMO CAME IN A SECOND TIME TO SAY THAT A FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT A LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND THAT SOME ONE FROM BEZZETEV'S WIDOW HAD A COW TO ASK PIERRE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOK AS SHE HERSELF WAS LEAVING FOR THE COUNTRY
1650-173551-0001 THERE WAS NO ONE IN HIS PASSAGE
1650-173551-0002 THE HALW PORTER WAS STANDING AT THE FRONT DOOR
1650-173551-0003 FROM THE LANDING WHERE PIERS STOOD THERE WAS A SECOND STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE BACK ENTRANCE
1650-173551-0004 HE WENT DOWN A STAIRCASE AND OUT INTO THE YARD NO ONE HAS SEEN HIM
1650-173551-0005 WHEN HE FELT THAT HE WAS BEING LOOKED AT HE BEHAVED LIKE AN OSTERBRIDGE WHICH HID ITS HEAD IN A BUSH IN ORDER NOW TO BE SEEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND QUICKENING HIS PACE WENT DOWN THE STREET
1650-173551-0006 HE HIRED THE FIRST A CAB HE MET AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE PATRIAX'S POUNCE WHERE THE WIDOW BADSITEV'S HOUSE WAS
1650-173551-0007 THIS WAS THE AUTHENTIC SCOTCH ACTS WITH PATHIVES NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS
1650-173551-0008 HE SAT DOWN AT THE DUSTY WRITING TABLE AND HAVING LAID THE MANUSCRIPTS BEFORE HIM OPENED THEM OUT CLOSED THEM FINALLY PUSHED THEM AWAY AND RESTING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND SANK INTO MENDICATION
1650-173551-0009 MAKERRY ALEXROVITCH CAME TWICE THAT EVENING SHUFFLING ALONG IN HIS SLASHES AS FAR AS THE DOOR AND STOPPED AND LOOKED INGRATIATINGLY AT PIERRE
1650-173552-0000 AT THAT VERY TIME AT TEN IN THE MORNING OF THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER NAPOLEON WAS STANDING AMONG HIS TROOPS ON A PYRLONIAN HEEL LOOKING AT THE PANORAMAS SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM
1650-173552-0001 THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE MORNING WAS A MAGICAL
1650-173552-0002 BUT THAT MY CLEMENCY IS ALWAYS READY TO DESCEND UPON THE VANQUISHED
1650-173552-0003 YET HERE SHE IS LYING AT MY FEET WITH HER GOLDEN DOMES AND CROSSES SINKINGULLATING IN A TWINKLING IN THE SUNSHINE
1650-173552-0004 BUT I I SHALL SPARE HER
1650-173552-0005 FROM THE HIDE OF THE KREMELIN YES THE HERE IS THE KREMELIN YES I WILL GIVE THEM JUST THE LOUTS I WILL TEACH THEM THE MEANING OF TRUE CIVILISATION I WILL MAKE GENERATIONS OF BOYARS REMEMBER THEIR CONQUEROR WITH LAUD
1650-173552-0006 I WILL TELL THE DEPUTATION THAT I DENOUNCE AND DO NOT DESIRE WAR THAT I WAGE THE WAR ONLY AGAINST THE FALSE POLICY OF THEIR COURT THAT I LOVE AND RESPECT ALEXANDER AND THAT IN MASSACRE I WILL ACCEPT TERMS OF PEACE WORTHY OF MYSELF AND MY PEOPLE
1650-173552-0007 I DO NOT WISH TO UTILIZE THE FORTUNES OF WAR TO HUMILIATE AND POWER THE MONARCH
1650-173552-0008 HE'LL HAVE TO BE TOLD ALL THE SAME SAYS SOME GENTLEMAN OF THIS SUITE BUT GENTLEMEN
1650-173552-0009 A SINGLE REPORT OF THE SICKENING GUN FOLLOWED AND THE TROOPS WHO WERE ALREADY SPREAD OUT ON DIFFERENT SIDES SOUTH MOSCOW MOVED INTO THE CITY THROUGH VORD KALOUGA AND DARGOMLEVKA
1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER WITH WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED A MAJESTIC TEACHER OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WISDOM
1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH HE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH HE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS FILLED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING IT PAPER I WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO NAME IT
1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN AT NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED YOUR TITLE
1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMBLED TOGETHER IN AS AWED A MANNER AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHFUL EFFECT
1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS THOMAS'S ABBREVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD IS MENTIONED
1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION
1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF BAD HABITS NEGLIGENT OF A TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED BY TIME
1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENCES OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING AS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
1651-136854-0009 YOUTHS AMBITIOUS AS THINKING HONOURS EASY TO BE HAD
1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRAISE PURSUED ON DIFFERENT PERIODS
1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCINI MANHOOD
1651-136854-0012 ONLY
1651-136854-0013 SCHOLAR'S FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADIES I
1651-136854-0014 IS DRAWN TO MAN BY WORDS REPELLED BY PASSIONS
1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGERS UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY RETURN
1651-136854-0016 THEIR EQUALITY HINDERS COMPLIANCE
1651-136854-0017 HIS SUPERIORITY PRODUCES INSOLENCE AND ENVY
1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD IN EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST AND TOO LITTLE
1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIORS EVERY ONE KNOWS OF INCONVENIENCE
1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN IN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN INTEREST
1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED SCARCE EVER WITHOUT A CHILDREN
1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MANY AGAIN FIVE
1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO WRONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY WOMEN
1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MORE READY WAY OF POURING OUR HEARTS
1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GUARD AND SUPPLY AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN MOST WISE AND INNOCENT AND A DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND WHOLLY
1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR IMAGINATION DENIES YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR BEAUTY SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
1651-136854-0029 NUMBER THIRTY TWO ON APPEARANCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANT OF STOICISM AS THE SUN OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENTENCES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRATES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED HIS PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
1651-136854-0031 THIS VITAL CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABBLER TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT IN A LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTERWOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES THEREFORE AS PLAIN CLOTH AND BROCADE
1686-142278-0000 HE WAS GONE AND
1686-142278-0001 NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES OR CRIMSON AND AMOUR TINTS
1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY SKETCHING CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALKING IN THE GARDEN
1686-142278-0003 HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANY THING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF ITS BRIEF SUCCESS AND ALL THE SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECTS OF HIS DESIRES OH DEAR
1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WORLD OF WORDS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER
1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD THE RESPONSES MORE TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0006 SHE FORGOT THAT HE HAD NEVER MADE THEM AN OFFER
1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHTS OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING BED TIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN
1686-142278-0008 OUR
1686-142278-0009 I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS IN US ALL
1686-142278-0010 WAS VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER AFTER HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS EFFORT
1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT THERE WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANSWER A MINUTE OR TWO
1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO THE FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
1686-142278-0015 BUT WHY DEAR PAPA DO TELL
1686-142278-0016 BECAUSE I MUST NO LONGER BE A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH IN ENGLAND
1686-142278-0017 BUT NOTHING TO THE SHOCK SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM MISTER HALE'S LAST SPEECH WHAT COULD HE MEAN
1686-142278-0018 AND IT WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR BEING SO MYSTERIOUS
1686-142278-0019 WHY I CAN YOU NO LONGER BE A CLERGYMAN
1686-142278-0020 SURELY IF THE BISHOP WERE TOLD ALL WE KNOW ABOUT PARADISE AND THE HARD AND JUST
1686-142278-0021 MARGARET I WILL TELL YE ABOUT IT
1686-142278-0022 I'LL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS ONCE BUT AFTER TO NIGHT LET US NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN
1686-142278-0023 I CAN METE THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY FAITHFUL MISERABLE DOUBTS BUT IT IS AN EFFORT BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING
1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION BUT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THAT HE PAUSED
1686-142278-0025 MARGARET SIGHED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEW HONOUR
1686-142278-0026 MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE HOLY CHURCH FROM WHICH I M TO BE SHUT OUT
1686-142278-0027 HE COULD NOT GO UPON FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
1686-142278-0028 MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WERE ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETRAN
1686-142278-0029 THE ONE STAYED FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER WAS REELING AND ROCKING
1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD ONCE BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE CAUSE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW INVOLVED
1686-142278-0031 LISTEN DEAR MARGARET SAID HE PUTTING ONE ARM ROUND MY WAIST
1686-142278-0032 ONE GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND YET HE WILL IN ANOTHER
1686-142278-0033 IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT AN ORDER TO A CONTINUANCE IN THEIR MINISTRY
1686-142278-0034 AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE WHICH HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEENNESS OF SUFFERING
1686-142278-0035 I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACH THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MIND LESS TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE
1686-142278-0036 HE SHOOK A HEAD AS HE WENT ON
1686-142278-0037 MARGARET I HAVE TRIED TO DO IT I TRIED TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THE ADDITIONAL PREFERMENT AND STOPPING QUIETLY HERE STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
1686-142278-0038 THEN GOD FORGIVE ME
1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING LOW WORDS OF SELF REPROACH AND HUMILIATION OF WHICH ROBERT WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT A FEW
1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD SAID BURDEN WE MUST LEAVE HELMSTONE
1686-142278-0041 BUT YES
1686-142278-0042 I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP I DARESAY I HAVE TOLD YOU SO BUT I FORGET THINGS JUST NOW SAID MISTER HALE COLLAPSING INTO HIS DEPRESSED MANNER AS SOON AS HE CAME TO TALK OF HARD MATTER OF FACT DETAILS INFORMING HIM OF MY INTENTION TO RESIGN MY VICARAGE
1686-142278-0043 THEY ARE BUT WHAT I HAVE TRIED UPON MYSELF WITHOUT A FEELING
1686-142278-0044 THAT WILL BE A TRIAL BUT WORSE FAR WORSE WILL BE THE DEPARTING FROM MY DEAD PEOPLE
1686-142278-0045 HE WAS COME TO STAY WITH US TO MORROW
1686-142278-0046 WAS IT TO BE SO SUDDEN THUS
1686-142278-0047 WHAT DOES MAMMA SAY

1686-142278-0050 PERHAPS AFTER ALL SHE MAY NOT COME YES
1686-142278-0051 SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED AS THE FORCE OF THE BLOW RETURNED ON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALISE HOW ANOTHER WOULD TAKE IT
1686-142278-0052 AND MILTON NORTHERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DULL INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENNESS OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER MIND
1686-142278-0053 THE MILTON NORTHERN
1686-142278-0054 HERE SAID HE IN THE SAME DESPONDENT INDIFFERENT WAY
1686-142278-0055 BUT HE WITH HIS QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ IN HER FACE AS IN A MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNED IT OFF WITH A EFFORT
1686-142278-0056 YES YOU SHALL BE TOLD ALL MARGARET
1686-142278-0057 ONLY HELP ME TO HEAR YOUR MOTHER

1686-142278-0060 MARGARET DID DISLIKE IT DID SHRINK FROM IT MORE THAN FROM ANY SHE HAD EVER HAD TO DO IN HER LIFE BEFORE
1686-142278-0061 AS MISTER HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDINGLY HE PRESSED HER HAND IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
1686-142278-0062 MARGARET WAS NEARLY UPSET AGAIN INTO A BURST OF RUNNING
1686-142278-0063 TO TURN HER THOUGHTS SHE SAID NOW TELL ME MADAM WHAT OUR PLANS ARE

1701-141759-0003 EACH TIME THAT THESE HINTS BEGAN TO MAKE THE COUNTESS ACTIVE AND SHE GLANCED UNEASILY AT THE COUNT AND AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA THE LATTER VERY ADROITLY TURNED THE CONVERSATION TO INSIGNIFICANT MATTERS
1701-141759-0004 BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE BE CAREFUL YOU KNOW HOW IT MAY AFFECT YOUR NAME

1701-141759-0017 SHE BELIEVED IT COULD BE THAT DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT
1701-141759-0018 SHALL YOU RUN TO HIM SHE ASKED
1701-141759-0019 NOW THAT HE WAS READY AN OFFICER AND A WOUNDED HERO WOULD IT BE RIGHT TO REMIND HIM OF HERSELF AND AS IT MIGHT SEEM OF THE OBLIGATIONS TO HER HE HAD TAKEN ON HIMSELF

1701-141759-0021 AND SONYA SMILES NO
1701-141759-0022 IT'S BECAUSE SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH A FAT ONE IN SPECTACLES THAT WAS HOW PETYA DESCRIBED HIS NAMESAKE THE NEW COUNT BEZUKHOV AND NOW SHE'S IN LOVE WITH THAT SINGER HE MET NATASHA'S ITALIAN SINGING MASTER THAT'S WHY SHE'S ASHAMED

1701-141759-0024 THE COUNTESS HAD BEEN PROVIDED BY ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S HINTS AT DINNER
1701-141759-0025 ON RETIRING TO HER OWN ROOM SHE SAT IN AN ARMCHAIR HER EYES FIXED ON A MINIATURE PORTRAIT OF HER SON ON THE LID OF A SNUFFBOX WHILE THE TEARS KEPT COMING TO HER EYES
1701-141759-0026 THE CAT PUT HIS EAR TO THE KEY HOLE AND LISTENED
1701-141759-0027 AT FIRST HE HEARD THE SOUND OF INDIGNANT VOICES THEN ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S VOICE ALONE IN A LONG SPEECH THEN A CRY THEN SILENCE THEN BOTH VOICES TOGETHER WITH GLAD INTONATIONS AND THEN FOOTSTEPS
1701-141759-0028 BUT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OPENED THE DOOR
1701-141759-0029 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS SONYA BLUSHED SO THAT TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES AND UNABLE TO BEAR HER LOOKS TURNED UPON HER RAN AWAY INTO THE DANCING HALL WHIRLED ROUND IT AT FULL SPEED WITH HER DRESS PUFFED OUT LIKE A BALLOON AND FLUSHED AND SMILING PLUMPED DOWN ON THE FLOOR
1701-141759-0030 THE COUNTESS WAS WAITING
1701-141759-0031 FROM ALL HE SAYS ONE SHOULD BE GLAD AND NOT CRIED
1701-141759-0032 HOW CHARMINGLY HE DESCRIBES SAID SHE READING THE DESCRIPTIVE PART OF THE LETTER AND WHAT A SOLA

1701-141760-0004 BORIS DURING THIS CAMPAIGN HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MANY PERSONS WHO MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO HIM AND BY A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION HE HAD BROUGHT FROM PIERRE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI THOUGH WHOM HE HOPED TO OBTAIN A POST ON THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF STAFF
1701-141760-0005 GORKE AND BORIS HAVING RESTED AFTER YESTERDAY'S MARCH WERE SITTING CLEAN AND NEATLY DRESSED AT A ROUND TABLE IN THE CLEAN QUARTERS ALLOTTED TO THEM PLAYING CHESS

1701-141760-0010 HE WANTED TO PINCH HIM PUSH HIM DO ANYTHING BUT KISS HIM A THING EVERYBODY HAD
1701-141760-0011 FOR NOTWITHSTANDING THIS BORIS EMBRACED HIM IN A QUIET FRIENDLY WAY AND KISSED HIM THREE TIMES
1701-141760-0012 THEY HAD NOT MET FOR NEARLY HALF A YEAR AND BEING AT THE AGE WHEN YOUNG MEN TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS ON LIFE'S ROAD EACH SOUGHT IMMENSE CHANGES IN THE OTHER QUITE A NEW REFLECTION OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN THOSE FIRST STEPS

1701-141760-0020 OH DON'T MENTION IT COUNT AND I QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID BORG GETTING UP AND SPEAKING IN A MUFFLED AND GUTTURAL VOICE
1701-141760-0021 GO ACROSS TO OUR HOSTE THEY INVITED YOU ADDED BORIS
1701-141760-0022 BERG PUT ON THE CLEANEST OF COATS WITHOUT A SPOT OR SPECK OF DUST STOOD BEFORE A LOOKING GLASS AND BRUSHED THE HAIR ON HIS TEMPLES UPWARDS IN THE WAY AFFECTED BY THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF FROM THE WAY ROSTOV LOOKED AT IT THAT HIS COAT HAD BEEN NOTICED LEFT THE ROOM WITH A PLEASANT SURPRISE
1701-141760-0023 OH DEAR WHAT A BEAST I AM MUTTERED ROSTOV AS HE READ THE LETTER WHY I
1701-141760-0024 WELL HAVE YOU SENT GABRIEL FOR SOME WINE ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE THIS
1701-141760-0025 IN A LETTER FROM HIS PARENTS WAS ENCLOSED A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION TO BAGRATION WHICH THE OLD COUNTESS AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S ADVICE HAD OBTAINED TO AN ACQUAINTANCE AND SENT TO HER SON ASKING HIM TO TAKE IT TO ITS DESTINATION AND MAKE USE OF IT
1701-141760-0026 WHY HAVE YOU THROWN THAT AWAY ASKED GORIS
1701-141760-0027 IT IS SOME LESSON OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT THE DEVIL DO I WANT IT FOR
1701-141760-0028 HE LOOKED INTENTLY AND INQUIRINGLY INTO HIS MOTHER'S EYES EVIDENTLY TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND THE ANSWER TO SOME QUESTION
1701-141760-0029 WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT COUNT THAT I WAS NOT AT ALL ALARMED BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS RIGHT
1701-141760-0030 I CAME FORWARD BERG STOOD UP AND SHOWED HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR A VOICE TO EXPRESS GREATER RESPECT AND SELF COMPLACENCY THAN HIS DID
1701-141760-0031 WELL HE STORMED AT ME AS THE SAYING IS STORMED AND STORMED AND STORMS
1701-141760-0032 IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF LIFE BUT RATHER OF DEATH AS THE SAYING IS AND
1701-141760-0033 ALBANIANS AND DEVILS AND TO SIBBERIA SAID BERG WITH A SAGACIOUS SMILE
1701-141760-0034 STILL I REMAINED SILENT AND WHEN DO YOU THINK COUNT
1701-141760-0035 THE NEXT DAY IT WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ORDERS OF THE CHURCH
1701-141760-0036 THAT'S THE WAY IN COUNT SAID BERG LIGHTING HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE
1701-141760-0037 YES THAT WAS VERY FINE SAID ROSTOV SMILING
1701-141760-0038 AND ROSTOV WAS A TRUTHFUL YOUNG MAN AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT HAVE TOLD A DELIBERATE LIE
1701-141760-0039 HE BEGAN HIS STORY MEANING TO TELL EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAPPENED BUT IMPERCEPTIBLY INVOLUNTARILY AND AND INEVITABLY HE LAPSED INTO FALSEHOOD
1701-141760-0040 PRINCE ANDREW WHO LIKED TO HELP YOUNG MEN WAS FLATTERED BY BEING ASKED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE AND BEING WELL DISPOSED TOWARD BORIS WHO HAD MANAGED TO PLEASE HIM THE DAY BEFORE HE USED TO DO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WANTED
1701-141760-0041 IN SPITE OF PRINCE ANDREW'S DISAGREEABLE IRONICAL TONE IN SPITE OF THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH ROSTOV FROM HIS FIGHTING ARMY POINT OF VIEW REGARDED ALL THESE LITTLE ADJUTANTS ON HIS STAFF OF WHOM THE NEWCOMER WAS EVIDENTLY ONE ROSTOV FELT CONFUSED BLUSHED AND BECAME SILENT
1701-141760-0042 BORIS INQUIRED WHAT NEWS THERE MIGHT BE ON THE STAFFS AND WHAT WITHOUT INDISCRETION ONE MIGHT ASK ABOUT OUR PLANS
1701-141760-0043 WE SHALL PROBABLY ARRIVE REPLIED BOLKOVSKI EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO SAY MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER
1701-141760-0044 BYRD TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WITH GREAT POLITENESS WHETHER AS WAS RUMORED THE ALLOWANCE OF FORAGE MONEY TO CAPTAINS OF COMPANIES WOULD BE DOUBLED
1701-141760-0045 I WAS NOW SAID ROSTOV ANGRILY AS IF INTENDING TO INSULT THE AIDE DE CAMP
1701-141760-0046 WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HE SAID YES THERE ARE MANY STORY NOW TOLD ABOUT THAT AFFAIR
1701-141760-0047 BUT ALL STORIES ARE THE STORIES OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER THE ENEMY'S FIRE
1701-141760-0048 OTHER STORIES HAVE SOME WEIGHT NOT LIKE THE STORIES OF THOSE FELLOWS ON THE STAFF WHO GET REWARDS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
1701-141760-0049 HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME BUT DON'T FORGET THAT I DO NOT REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED AND THAT A MAN OLDER THAN YOU MY ADVICE IS TO LET THE MATTER DROP
1701-141760-0050 EXCLAIMED PRINCE ANDREW AND WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH SHE WENT OUT
1701-141760-0051 AND HE WAS STILL VERY ANGRY AT HAVING OMITTED TO SEE IT
1701-141760-0052 HE ORDERED HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND COLDLY TAKING LEAVE OF BOERS RODE HOME
1701-141760-0053 SHOULD HE GO TO HEADQUARTERS NEXT DAY AND CHALLENGE THAT AFFECTED ADJUTANT OR REALLY LET THE MATTER DROP WAS THE QUESTION THAT HURRIED HIM ALL THE WAY
2506-11267-0000 ICY SHORES TO THEM DEPART NOT PERHAPS WITHOUT AN INNATE LONGING TOO TO QUIT THE ISLAND ALONG WITH THOSE HAPPY SNOBS

2506-11267-0005 THE LADY MARCHIONESS COMES ON BOARD LOOKS ROUND WITH THAT HAPPY AIR OF MINGLED TERROR AND IMPERTINENCE WHICH DISTINGUISHES HER LADYSHIP AND RUSHES TO HER CARRIAGE FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD MINGLE WITH THE OTHER SNOBS ON DECK
2506-11267-0006 AND THERE SHE SITS AND WILL BE ILL IN PRIVATE

2506-169427-0003 EUGENIUS WOULD NEVER ADMIT THIS BUT WOULD OFTEN TELL HIM THAT ONE DAY OR OTHER HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE RECKONED WITH AND HE WOULD OFTEN ADD IN AN ACCENT OF SORROWFUL APPREHENSION TO THE UTTERMOST MIGHT

3660-172182-0020 AND BEING YOUNG HE CHANGED HIMSELF AND GREW TO HATE THE SIN THAT SEEMED SO LIKE HIS OWN OF MODRED ATHA'S NEPHEW AND FELL AT LAST IN THE GREAT BATTLE FIGHTING FOR THE KING
3660-172182-0021 AND WHEN DURAN CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE GWENEVER WAS HE SALUTED HER
3660-172182-0022 THEN THEY WENT IN AND DISMOUNTED AND
3660-172182-0023 HEAVEN PROTECT THEE SAID ARTHUR AND THE WOMAN OF HEAVEN BE UNTO THEE
3660-172182-0024 AND INASMUCH AS THOU HAST VANQUISHED EDDIRAN THE SON OF NUD THOU HAST HAD A PROSPEROUS CAREER
3660-172182-0025 AND FROM THAT TIME YOU BECAME HIS WIFE
3660-172182-0026 AND THE MAIDEN TOOK UP HER ABODE IN THE PALACE AND SHE HAD MANY COMPANIONS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND THERE WAS NO MAIDEN MORE ESTEEMED THAN SHE ON THE ISLAND OF BRITAIN
3660-172182-0027 AND A YEAR BUT A SECOND AND A THIRD HE PROCEEDED THUS UNTIL HIS FAME HAD FLOWN OVER THE FACE OF THE KINGDOM
3660-172182-0028 AND HE GREETS THEE WELL AS AN UNCLE SHOULD GREET HIS NEPHEW AND AS A VASSAL SHOULD GREET HIS DAUGHTER
3660-172182-0029 AND THE NEIGHBOURING CHIEFS KNOWING THIS GROW INSOLENT TOWARD HIM AND COVER HIS LANDS AND POSSESSIONS
3660-172182-0030 AND ARTHUR TOLD DURRANT THE CAUSE OF THE MISSIONS AND OF THE COMING OF THE AMBASSADORS TO HIM OUT OF CORNWALL TRULY SAID DURRANT BE IT TO MY ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE LORD I WILL DO ACCORDING TO THY WILL CONCERNING THIS EMBASSY
3660-172182-0031 WHAT DISCOURSE SAID GWEN OVER DO I HEAR BETWEEN YOU
3660-172182-0032 SAID GERAINT I THINK I SHALL HAVE ENOUGH OF KNIGHTHOOD WITH ME AND THEY SET FORTH
3660-172182-0033 BUT NEVER WAS THERE SEEN A FAIRER HOST JOURNEYING TOWARD THE SEVERN
3660-172182-0034 BUT HE SAID TO DURRANT I AM A FEEBLE AND AN AGED MAN AND WHILST I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE DOMINIONS FOR THEE AND FOR MYSELF I DID SO
3660-172182-0035 AS EVERY ONE ASKED THAT WHICH HE DESIRED
3660-172182-0036 AND THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GIVING SO EAGER WAS ANY ONE TO BESTOW GIFTS AND OF THOSE WHO CAME TO ASK GIFTS NONE DEPARTED UNSATISFIED
3660-172182-0037 THEN GERVINE SENT EMBASSES TO THE MEN OF CORNWALL TO ASK THEM MISS
3660-172182-0038 AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WOULD BE THE FULNESS OF JOY AND HONOR TO THEM FOR DURAN TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR HOMAGE
3660-172182-0039 SO HE RECEIVED HER HOMAGE OF SUCH AS WERE THERE
3660-172182-0040 AND THE DAY AFTER THE FOLLOWERS OF ARTHUR INTENDED TO GO WAY
3660-172183-0000 DURRAINT AS HE HAD BEEN USED TO DO WHEN HE WAS IN ARTHUR'S COURT FREQUENTED TOURNAMENTS
3660-172183-0001 BEFORE DURRAINS THE SCOURGE OF THE ENEMY I SAW STEEDS WHITE WITH FOAM AND AFTER THE SHOUT OF BATTLE A FEARFUL TORRENT
3660-172183-0002 THESE TIDINGS CAME TO URBEAN
3660-172183-0003 NOT I BY MY CONFESSION UNTO HEAVEN SAID SHE THERE IS NOTHING MORE HATEFUL UNTO ME THAN
3660-172183-0004 AND THE TEARS SHE SAID AND THE WORDS SHE HAD SPOKEN AWOKE IN HIM
3660-172183-0005 AND EVIL BETIDE ME SAID HE IF THOU RETURNEST HERE UNTIL THOU KNOWEST WHETHER I HAVE LOST MY STRENGTH SO COMPLETELY AS THOU DID'ST SAY
3660-172183-0006 THEN CURRAINE WENT TO SEE URBAN
3660-172183-0007 SIR SAID HE I AM GOING UPON A QUEST AS I AM NOT CERTAIN WHEN I MAY COME BACK
3660-172183-0008 TAKE HEED THEREFORE UNTO THY PROFESSIONS UNTIL MY RETURN
3660-172183-0009 BUT ONE PERSON ONLY WILL GO WITH HIM
3660-172183-0010 AND HE DESIRED ENID TO MOUNT HER HORSE AND TO RIDE FORWARD AND TO KEEP A LONG WAY FOR HIM
3660-172183-0011 AND UNLESS I SPEAK UNTO THEE SAY NOT THOU ONE WORD ANY
3660-172183-0012 AND THOUGH THOU SHOULDST DESIRE TO SEE MY DEFEAT AND MY DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THOSE MEN YET DO I FEEL NO DOUBT
3660-172183-0013 AND HE RECEIVED HIM AND THIS NOT FEEBLY
3660-172183-0014 AND SAY NOT ONE WORD UNTO ME UNLESS I SPEAK FULL UNTO THEE
3660-172183-0015 I WILL DO AS FAR AS I CAN LORD SAID SHE ACCORDING TO OUR DESIRE
3660-172183-0016 AH MY MAIDEN SAID HE IT IS VAIN TO ATTEMPT PROCEEDING FORWARD
3660-172183-0017 I CANNOT BY ANY MEANS REFRAIN FROM SLEEP THROUGH WEARINESS SAID HE DO THEY THEREFORE WATCH THE HORSES AND SLEEP NOT
3660-172183-0018 AS WHEN SHE SAW THE DAWN OF DAY APPEAR SHE LOOKED AROUND HER TO SEE IF HE WERE WAKING AND THEREUPON HE WOKE
3660-172183-0019 AND THEY LEFT THE WOOD AND THEY CAME TO AN OPEN COUNTRY WITH MEADOWS ON ONE HAND AND MOS AND MOWING THE MEADOWS
3660-172183-0020 MY LORD HE ADDED WILL IT BE DISPLEASING TO THEE IF I ASK WHENCE THOU COMEST THUS
3660-172183-0021 WILT THOU FOUL MY SONG SAID THE YOUTH AND TAKE THY MEAL FROM ME
3660-172183-0022 WHAT SORT OF MEAL I INQUIRED
3660-172183-0023 THEN THEY WASHED AND PUT THEIR REPAST
3660-172183-0024 I GO NOW LORD SAID HE TO MEETING THE KNIGHT AND TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS LODGING
3660-172183-0025 I WILL DO LORD SAID SHE AS THOU SAYEST IT
3660-172183-0026 AND AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRANK JEHRAIN WENT TO SLEEP AND SO DID ENID ALSO
3660-6517-0000 THE DATES SEEM UNIMPORTANT BUT THROUGHOUT THE FIELD THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE SHIP HAVE BEEN UNREMITTINGLY BUSY
3660-6517-0001 BOWERS ATTACKED THE SHIP'S STORES SURVEYED RELISTED AND RESTOWED THEM SAVING VERY MUCH SPACE BY UNTOWING NUMEROUS CASES AND STOWING THE CONTENTS IN THE LAZARETTE
3660-6517-0002 WITHOUT STEAM THE LEAK CAN NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH THE HAND PUMP BY TWO DAILY EFFORTS IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES
3660-6517-0003 AS THE SHIP WAS AND OF HER PRESENT HEAVILY LADEN CONDITION IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE OR FOUR HOURS EACH DAY
3660-6517-0004 THE LARGE GREEN TENT WAS PUT UP AND PROPER SUPPORTS MADE
3660-6517-0005 THE ENGINE ROOM STAFF AND ANDERSEN'S PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOWING THEIR LABORATORIES THE COOK REFITTING HIS GALLEYS AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD ITS BAND OF WORKERS
3660-6517-0006 THE MEN SPACE SUCH AS IT IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FORE HATCH TO THE STEM OF THE MAIN DECK
3660-6517-0007 UNDER THE FORECASTLE ARE STALLS OF FIFTEEN PONIES A MAXIMUM THE SPACE WOULD HOLD THE NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT IS PACKED TIGHT WITH FODDER
3660-6517-0008 IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FORECASTLE BULK HEAD IS A SMALL BOOBY HATCH THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE MEN'S MESS DECK IN BAD WEATHER
3660-6517-0009 ABAFT THE FORE HATCH AS THE ICE HOUSE
3660-6517-0010 WE MANAGED TO GET THREE TONS OF ICE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO CARCASES OF MUTTON AND THREE COUCASSES OF BEEF BESIDES SOME BOXES OF SWEETBREADS AND KIDNEYS INTO THE SPACE
3660-6517-0011 THE SACKS CONTAINING THIS LAST ADDED TO THE GOODS ALREADY MENTIONED MAKE A REALLY HEAVY DECK CARGO AND ONE MAN IS NATURALLY ANXIOUS CONCERNING IT BUT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY LASHING AND SECURING HAS BEEN DONE
3660-6517-0012 FOR YOU I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIRTY TONS OF COMPRESSED OAT AND HAY FROM MELBOURNE
3660-6517-0013 THE SCENE IS WHOLLY ENCHANTING AND LIKE A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER IN A GARDEN WHICH BLAZES WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION WITH ALL THINGS
3660-6517-0014 A GREAT GREY MASS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED
3660-6517-0015 KAY AND I LUNCH WITH A PARTY IN THE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY'S SHIP RUTAHOO
3660-6517-0016 TELEGRAM TO SAY TERNOVA HAD ARRIVED SUNDAY NIGHT
3660-6517-0017 A THIRD SLEDGE STANDS ACROSS THE BREAK OF THE POOP IN THE SPACE HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY THE AFTER WHENCH
3660-6517-0018 THE QUANTITY IS TWO AND A HALF TON'S AND THE SPACE OCCUPIED CONSIDERABLE
3660-6517-0019 THE FISH WAS OVER TWO FEET BY THE STERN BUT THIS WILL SOON BE REMEDIED
3660-6517-0020 THEY MUST PERFORCE BE CHAINED UP AND THEY ARE GIVEN WHAT SHELTER IS AFFORDED IN DECK BUT THEIR POSITION IS NOT ENVIABLE
3660-6517-0021 IT IS A PATHETIC ATTITUDE EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY OCCASIONALLY SOME POOR BEASTS EMITS A LONG PATHETIC WHINE
3660-6517-0022 THERE ARE GENERALLY ONLY ONE OR TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASES MATTERS BUT IT IS A SQUASH
3660-6517-0023 LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND HAVING VEERED TO THE WESTWARD HEADING US SLIGHTLY
3660-6517-0024 OATES AND ATKINSON WITH INTERMITTENT INSISTENCE FROM OTHERS WERE BUSY KEEPING THE PONIES ON THEIR LEGS
3660-6517-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EVIL AND NEARLY ALL HANDS WERE LABOURING FOR HOURS IN THE WAISTS OF THE SHIP HEAVING COAL SACKS OVERBOARD AND RELARSHING THE PETROL CASES ET CETERA IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
3660-6517-0026 AND NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED THAN SOME EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY WAVE WOULD TEAR AWAY THE LASHING AND THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN
3660-6517-0027 FROM THIS MOMENT ABOUT FOUR A M THE STEAM ROOM BECAME THE CENTRE OF INTEREST
3660-6517-0028 THE WATER GAINED IN SPITE OF EACH EFFORT
3660-6517-0029 THE OUTLOOK APPEARING GRIM
3660-6517-0030 THE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH WAS BEING MADE WITH THE SHIPS SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS MOST UNUSUAL
3660-6517-0031 WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW FIRES IF WAS TO BE DONE
3660-6517-0032 THE BILAGE PUMP IS DEPENDENT ON THE RAIN ENGINE
3660-6517-0033 ON ONE OCCASION I WAS WAIST DEEP WHEN STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THAT POOP
3660-6517-0034 THE AFTERGUARD WERE ORGANIZED IN TWO PARTIES BY EVANS TO WORK BUCKETS THE MEN WERE KEPT STEADILY GOING ON THE CHOKED HAND PUMPS THIS SEEMED ALL THAT COULD BE DONE FOR THE MOMENT AND WHAT A MEASURE TO COUNT AS THE SOLE SAFEGUARDS OF THE SHIP FROM SINKING PRACTICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BAIL HER OUT
3660-6517-0035 OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD BEAR ONE OF THEM AWAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED FROM HIS CHAIN
3663-172005-0000 THE FAWN HAD TAKEN ITS MORNING MEAL AND NOW LAY CURLED UP ON THE BED OF MOSS
3663-172005-0001 WHENEVER THE FAWN CAME UP HE WAS QUITE CONTENT TO FRISK ABOUT
3663-172005-0002 THE DANGER WAS CERTAIN AND NOW IT WAS NEAR
3663-172005-0003 THE HOUNDS HAD STRUCK A TRAIL WHERE SHE HAD TURNED AND THE FAWN WAS SAFE
3663-172005-0004 ONE WAS ROWING THE OTHER HAD A GUN INTO HIS HAND WHAT SHOULD SHE DO
3663-172005-0005 AND HER TIRED LEGS COULD NOT PROPEL THE TIRED BODY RAPIDLY
3663-172005-0006 THE DOLE SAW THE BOAT NEARING HER
3663-172005-0007 IN A MOMENT MORE THE BOAT WAS ON HER AND THE MEN AT THE OARS HAD LEANED OVER AND CAUGHT
3663-172528-0000 I WAS TORMENTED BY THIRST BUT HAD ABSTAINED FROM DRINKING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE CAPTAIN'S ORDERS
3663-172528-0001 THAT OLD MAN CEASED TO GIVE SO MUCH ANNOYANCE YET SOMETIMES HE APPEARED TO HIM IN DREAMS
3663-172528-0002 FELICIA GIVEN THEM ORDERS NOT TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE
3663-172528-0003 THIS MAID HAD STOLEN FROM ME CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND IN HER FEAR OF BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD WAITED
3663-172528-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE ALLOWED ME QUITE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FULL I THEN COVERED MYSELF AND BEGAN TO SWEAT AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
3663-172528-0005 THEY SAY THAT MY POOR FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO GRIEVED WAS HE TO LEARN THIS
3663-172528-0006 AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY STATE AND BEGAN TO BEAT AT THE SERVING GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT SHOUTING OUT AH TRAITRESS YOU HAVE KILLED HIM FOR ME THEN
3663-172528-0007 AND SHE MAY INDEED HAVE SAVED MY LIFE SO LEND ME A HELPING HAND FOR I HAVE SWEATED AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT
3663-172528-0008 FELICIA RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS RUBBED AND MADE ME COMFORTABLE AND I BEING CONSCIOUS OF A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN MY STATE BEGAN TO RECKON ON RECOVERY
3663-172528-0009 BUT JUST THEN THE OTHER DOCTOR BERNARDINO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAD REFUSED TO BLEED ME
3663-172528-0010 MAESTRO FRANCESCO THAT MOST ABLE MAN EXCLAIMED OH PARDON OF NATURE
3663-172528-0011 SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE CITIZENS KNOW NOTHING
3663-172528-0012 THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER AND SAYING IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED UPON THE SPOT
3663-172528-0013 AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK A MORE WATER
3663-172528-0014 I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I AM ENTIRELY QUENCHED MY THIRST
3663-172528-0015 IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED YOU NOT TO BLEED HIM
3663-172528-0016 IF I KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE
3663-172528-0017 YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HER CURE
3663-172528-0018 AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHUT HIS FACE AGAIN
3663-172528-0019 THAT VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL ROLLED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD
3663-172528-0020 DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED TO THIS TIME IN ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM
3663-172528-0021 THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKES
3663-172528-0022 SO I MADE MY MIND UP AND PREPARED TO DRIVE
3663-172528-0023 THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIERRE LANDY WHO IS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
3663-172528-0024 NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE AGGUTTO WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
3663-172528-0025 I HAD HARBOURED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR THIS MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS
3663-172528-0026 MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DA MONTEVARGI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL
3663-172528-0027 THERE THEY SEATED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE OAK WENT BY
3663-172528-0028 MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE
3663-172528-0029 AT THESE WORDS MAESTRO AGOSTINO THE DUKE'S TALEOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT
3663-172528-0030 GEORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MYASTHRO AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED THERE IS THE MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF THAT BE TRUE OR NOT
3663-172528-0031 AS FIERCELY AS I COULD NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED GIORGIO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED HIM
3663-172528-0032 HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO AND THAT SHE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THE SORT
3663-172528-0033 MAESTRO AGOSTINO RETORTED YOU A GALLOWS BIRD
3663-172528-0034 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT FOR MOST PERSONS
3663-172528-0035 GEORGIO MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NEVER ACCUSED ME
3663-172528-0036 THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE COOK CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND HE HALTED
3663-172528-0037 THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MARVELED THAT I WAS STILL ALIVE AFTERWARDS HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH
3663-172528-0038 WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTE A GUTTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER OF A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME
3663-172528-0039 I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND TOLD HIM ALL THE AFFAIR BY THE MINT
3663-172528-0040 HE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE THE VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT
3663-172528-0041 I THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIETRO PAGOLON ADVICE ABOUT STAMPING THE COINS AND THEN WENT OFF UPON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE DUKE OR ANYBODY ELSE
3663-172528-0042 YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALIZE THAT FEROCIOUS SERPENT
3663-172528-0043 YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF OURS
3663-172528-0044 IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF PAUL CLEMENT
3663-172528-0045 MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE HAD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DYES FOR THAT MEDAL
3663-172528-0046 I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHALL NEVER SEE THEM MORE
3663-172528-0047 I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENECINO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL
3663-172528-0048 NICCOLO DA MONTERE GUTTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENCIOS FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
3663-172528-0049 NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS ARREST BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
3663-172528-0050 I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FARTHER TO MY BEST ABILITY
3663-172528-0051 THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF GOOD HUMOUR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED
3663-172528-0052 I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT FOUR OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL
3663-172528-0053 I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE SEEN BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING
3663-172528-0054 I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROMEO
3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUSTED TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE
3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRINCE IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE
3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADES THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF GUANA
3915-57461-0003 HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED ON FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELERS EMBARKED
3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE THEM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM
3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RONIN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
3915-57461-0006 NOW ALAS BY THIS MISFORTUNE THY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE
3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORIES AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM
3915-57461-0008 THEN THE ROANON SAYS TO THE BOATMAN
3915-57461-0009 WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER CHANCELLORS
3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONINE HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE WANON OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO
3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM THE CHILD
3915-57461-0013 SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET IT HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF
3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH THE VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR
3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATIONS TOKOBAY FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING O MISERY MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME
3915-57461-0016 NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF THE CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET
3915-57461-0017 AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY TWISTING ALL OVER
3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO AT THE CU'ANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT
3915-57461-0019 HAPLY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER RUNNING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART
3915-57461-0020 ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF A MARVELLOUS AILMENT
3915-57461-0021 THINKING I COULD DIVINE OUR CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
3915-57461-0022 AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO BEAR A MALICE
3915-57461-0023 REPENT THEREFORE AND ABANDON YE EVIL WAYS
3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THE HEIGHT OF A HAPPINESS
3915-57461-0025 BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO YOU
3915-57461-0026 IN A FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND KILL YOU
3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GROW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN AND THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOME DAY OVERTAKE ME
3915-57461-0028 HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I HAD LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL
3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL SAFE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
3915-57461-0030 A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLE OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT
3915-98647-0000 EVERY WELL ORDERED JAPANESE HOUSE OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTER OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOUSE
3915-98647-0001 SHE IT IS WHO PUTS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY AND ANNIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS
3915-98647-0002 SHE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHER AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE
3915-98647-0003 VISITS TO NOTED TEMPERS BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION
3915-98647-0004 ALL THESE WERE PUT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT THE CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE TESTIMONY OF HER SON
3915-98647-0005 AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S SAFE KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE
3915-98647-0006 EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILFUL BALANCER OF PROSE AND KHANS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PECULIAR YEAR WILL BE
3915-98647-0007 FOR THE GREATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE THEIR HOME PROPHECIES ARE FELT TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN AND THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED IN
3915-98647-0008 NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO PASS THE FRONT DOOR
3915-98647-0009 AFTER THIS MANNER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THIS HOUSE IS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS
3915-98647-0010 OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHEN THE RIVER IS RAISED
3915-98647-0011 THE HOUSE OWNER THUS DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
3915-98647-0012 A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABORERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGE POLE CASTS DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCRAMBLE JOYFULLY
3915-98647-0013 ALL COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CANNOT COME SEND PERSONS OR PROVISIONS
3915-98647-0014 ON THE DAY AFTER HIS DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN A CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS THE STYLE COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN
3915-98647-0015 NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THAT SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES A SURVIVAL OF AN OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE
3915-98647-0016 AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE GUEST CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE
3915-98647-0017 THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS OR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL
3915-98647-0018 UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL OF THAT LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS
3915-98647-0019 WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IT IS DRESSED IN WHITE AND SILK HABO TAE WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT
3915-98647-0020 THE BODY TOO IS PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS
3915-98647-0021 THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THE COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS AS THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD
3915-98647-0022 THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEED THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER IN DEATH
3915-98647-0023 LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF COAL
3915-98647-0024 SO LONG AS THE COFFIN IS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER EXCEEDINGLY
3915-98647-0025 IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING ABOUT THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES
3915-98647-0026 THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED CHAMPIONS WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY
3915-98647-0027 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCURS IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THESE CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED
3915-98647-0028 A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUKUCHAWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING
3915-98647-0029 IN HIS WILL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING IN THE CLOTHING WITH WHICH HE DIED
3915-98647-0030 THROUGH THIS GROWING FEELING ON THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES
3915-98647-0031 JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT MY HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY
3915-98647-0032 ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEAD A BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT
3915-98647-0033 SOMETIMES WITH THE GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THIS FUNERAL TRAIN
3915-98647-0034 ANOTHER FAVOURITE FAVORITE AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON
3915-98647-0035 IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURIAL THAT
3915-98647-0036 DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE AND A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET OUT IN THE DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY
4153-185072-0000 HE TARRIED AT GENNESHAW A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP TO GADOL WHERE I THEN RESIDED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE WINTER CAME ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS STAY
4153-185072-0001 THE ENRAGED HUSBAND WELL KNOWING THAT HE SHOULD FEEL A BLOW IF HE WAITED TO HEAR THE ORDER REPEATED INSTANTLY RETREATED AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS VESSEL
4153-185072-0002 WE PROTECTED THE POOR NATTICOKE WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUALS AND ALLAN SYMPATHIZED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES TILL SPRING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE PROMISED A REFORMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OF RENEWAL OF HER AFFECTIONS
4153-185072-0003 THE INDIANS WERE SOON ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN OFFICER THAT THE WAMPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS EVIDENTLY WISHED FOR
4153-185072-0004 MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ALEAN'S HORSE AND CARRIED THE GOODS
4153-185072-0005 ALLEYNE ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT OF HIS RETURN THEY WERE SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTLES WHO MARRIED PRISCILLA RAMSAY BUT A SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM
4153-185072-0006 NETTLES AT LENGTH ABANDONED THE CHASE WENT HOME AND AWEEN ALL IN TATTERS CAME IN
4153-185072-0007 FOR RUNNING IN THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO RAGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SUFFERING CONDITION ALMOST NAKED
4153-185072-0008 ALLEYNE MADE HIS TROUSERS HIMSELF AND THEN BUILT A RAFT UPON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MONT MORRIS
4153-185072-0009 THERE AN INDIAN GAVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A GOOD GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE BEARDSTOWN WHERE THEY FOUND HIS SQUAW
4153-185072-0010 NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THAT PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GARDOS
4153-185072-0011 THE LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SWIFTNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO TAKE HIS ESCAPE TO HIS FORMER CASTLE OF SAFETY
4153-185072-0012 HIS PURSUERS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE WHERE THEY HAD EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETED AND UNDER MY PROTECTION
4153-185072-0013 STILL UNSATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THEY ADVISED MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME THE SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDERED OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT TO MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF HER SITUATION AND FINALLY THEY LEFT ME
4153-185072-0014 HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOKE ME WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION FEARING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN AND IN PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
4153-185072-0015 AT THAT TIME NOLAN LAY IN A SECRET PLACE IN THE GULF A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FLATS IN A HOLE THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER
4153-186222-0000 THERE IS LITTLE DANGER IN THIS QUARTER I'M SURE SO I MAY AS WELL BE FRIEND WITH THE POOR CHILD
4153-186222-0001 AH WHY NEVER
4153-186222-0002 YOU BETH HESITATED
4153-186222-0003 MY LETTER ASKING ME TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAVE EVER RECEIVED FROM HER
4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE SHE ASKED ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FRIENDLY AND SO I ACCEPTED THAT INVITATION
4153-186222-0005 SURELY TWO BIRDS WILL HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS LONELY OLD PLACE THAN ONE COULD HAVE ALONE
4153-186222-0006 OH YES SHE HAS CORRECTED LUIS
4153-186222-0007 YOU MEAN PATRICIA DOYLE YES AND
4153-186222-0008 THEN WE MAY CONCLUDE SHE' IS LEFT OUT OF THE ARRANGEMENT SAID BETH CALMLY
4153-186222-0009 YOU'LL FIGHT FOR YOUR OWN CHANCE AND FIGHT IT MIGHTY HARD
4153-186222-0010 WHY MY DEAR COUSIN I DON'T WANT AUNT ANNE'S MONEY
4153-186222-0011 MY MOTHER AND I ARE AMPLY PROVIDED FOR AND I AM ONLY HERE TO FIND REST FROM MY SOCIAL DUTIES AND TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH MY GOOD FATHER'S SISTER THAT IS ALL
4153-186222-0012 MY FATHER TEACHES MUSIC AND MOTHER SCOLDS HIM CONTINUALLY BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT
4153-186222-0013 WE'VE NEVER SEEN A CENT OF HER MONEY UNTIL FATHER HAS TRIED AT TIMES TO BORROW ENOUGH TO HELP HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
4153-186222-0014 I EVEN KISSED HER WHEN SHE ASKED ME TO AND IT SENT A SHIVER OF DOWN MY BACK
4153-186222-0015 FOR MY PART I AM FOND OF SOME ONE AND IT DELIGHTS ME TO FUSS AROUND INVALIDS AND ASSIST THEM
4153-186222-0016 YOU SAY YOU'D LIKE TO CARE FOR IN WILLID'S AND I DON'T
4153-186222-0017 YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME THINK YOU DON'T WANT ELMHURST WHEN YOU'RE AS ANXIOUS TO TAKE IT AS I AM
4153-186222-0018 THEY CALL ME BETH SULLENLY OH
4153-186222-0019 I COULDN'T LIE IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW
4153-186222-0020 BUT SUPPOSE SHE LEAVES IT TO YOU PERSISTED BEE
4153-186222-0021 BUT LOUISE SEEMED TO MEDITATE
4153-186222-0022 IT'S A MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID BETH LOOKING AT HER COUSIN DOUBTFUL
4153-186222-0023 NOW SHALL WE BE FRIENDS SHE ASKED LIKELY
4153-186222-0024 TO BE SURE I SHOULD WANT YOU TO MY LADY
4153-186222-0025 SUCH A GIRL FRIEND IT HAD NEVER BEEN HER PRIVILEGE TO HAVE HAD BEFORE AND WHEN HER SUSPICIONS WERE FORGOTTEN SHE BECAME FAIRLY RESPONSIVE AND BRIGHTENED WONDERFULLY
4153-186222-0026 SILAS SHE SAID WHEN HE ENTER WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY NIECES
4153-186222-0027 THEY ARE VERY CHARMING GIRLS HE ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THEY ARE AT AN AGE WHEN FEW GIRLS SEEM TO GOOD ADVANTAGE
4153-186222-0028 WHY DID YOU NOT INVITE KENNETH TO DINNER KATE THE BOY
4153-186222-0029 HE IS CONSTANTLY SAYING THAT DISAGREEABLE THINGS
4153-186222-0030 VERY WELL SAID THE LAWYER QUIETLY WHAT OF MY NIECES DO YOU PREFER
4153-186222-0031 ASKED THE OLD LADY AFTER A PAUSE I CANNOT SAY ON SO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE HE ANSWERED WITH THE GRAVITY WHICH DO YOU PREFER JANE
4153-186222-0032 THEY ARE USUALLY UNSATISFACTORY SHE ANSWERED
4153-186222-0033 I CANNOT IMAGINE ELMHURST BELONGING TO EITHER SILAS A
4153-186222-0034 I MUST SEE THAT OTHER NIECE THE ONE WHO TRIES ME AND REFUSES TO ANSWER MY SECOND LETTER
4153-186222-0035 THERE WOULD BE A DOZEN HEIRS TO FIGHT FOR MY MONEY AND DEAR OLD ELMHURST TO BE SOLD TO STRANGERS SHE RESUMED WITH BITTERNESS
4153-186223-0000 IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE ROOM KENNETH FORBES SQUATTED UPON A BENCH WITH AN EMPTY PINE BOX SET CARELESSLY IN HIS LAP
4153-186223-0001 WHILE DUNCAN LOOKED THE BOY WAS BUSY WITH HIS PENCILS BUT NEITHER HAD SPOKEN FOR AT LEAST A HALF HOUR
4153-186223-0002 THEN RIDING SLOWLY UP THE HEDGE BORDERED ROAD HIS HOPES ONCE MORE ASSAILED HIM AND HE WONDERED IF THERE WAS NOT SOME SPOT UPON THE BROAD EARTH TO WHICH HE COULD FLY FOR RETIREMENT UNTIL THE GIRLS HAD LEFT ELMHURST FOR GOOD
4153-186223-0003 NORAH SHIED AND HE LOOKED UP TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAD NEARLY RUN DOWN A PEDESTRIAN A STOUT LITTLE MAN WITH A BUNDLE UNDER HIS ARM WHO HELD UP ONE HAND AS IF TO ADDRESS HIM
4153-186223-0004 WHERE WILL YOU WANT TO GO ASKED THE BOY
4153-186223-0005 THEN IT'S THE SAME THEN AS EVER HE RESPONDED WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
4153-186223-0006 DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT O I HOPED SHE'D REFORMED AND I'D BE GLAD TO SEE HER AGAIN THEY TELL ME SHE'S GOT MONEY
4153-186223-0007 AUNT JANEY'S RICH AUNT JANE
4153-186223-0008 ECHOED THE MAN QUICKLY BUT WHAT YOU NAME LAD
4153-186223-0009 YOU DON'T LIKE GIRLS I THINK IT
4153-186223-0010 ANOTHER LONG PAUSE THEN THE BOY SUDDENLY TURNED AT QUESTIONER
4153-186223-0011 YOU YOU KNOW AUNT MISS MERRICK SIR
4153-186223-0012 I USED TO WHEN WE WERE MOST YOUNGER
4153-186223-0013 KENNETH STOPPED SHORT AND THE MAYOR STOPPED AND THE LITTLE MAN WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE AT A BOY'S ASTONISHMENT ALSO STOPPED
4153-186223-0014 JOHN MERRICK THAT'S WE
4153-186223-0015 YOU ARE THE KINSMITH
4153-186223-0016 THEY KEPT TRACK OF HER BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY BECAME RICH AND A GREAT LADY AND THAT WAS A SURPRISING THING TO HAPPEN TO A MERRI
4153-186223-0017 THANK YOU LAD RETURNED THE MAN GRATEFULLY I THOUGHT A LITTLE EXERCISE WOULD DO ME GOOD BUT THIS THREE MILE HAD SEEMED LIKE THIRTY TO ME
4153-186223-0018 IT WILL SAID THE MAN
4153-186223-0019 THE BOY TURNED AWAY BUT IN A MOMENT HALTED THEN
4153-186223-0020 HIS INTEREST IN MISS JANE'S BROTHER SON WAS EXTRAORDINARY
4153-61735-0000 THEY ARE BUT LUKEWARM LOVERS WHO CAN CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH A DIALOGUE CARRIED ON AT BEAUSLOT DISTANCE
4153-61735-0001 IF THERE BE THE ELYSIUM ON EARTH IT IS THIS
4153-61735-0002 HIS OWN DAUGHTER HIS ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE BEST BLOOD OF SOUTHERN ARISTOCRACY BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED EVERY THING TO SECURE HIM A SPLENDID ALLIANCE HOLDING THE KNIGHTLY ASSIGNATION WITH A HORSE HUNTER
4153-61735-0003 HE COULD WELL CONCEDE SO MUCH TO HER CAPRICE SINCE HER STAYING AT HOME COULD BE NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE CAUSES THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO THE STERN COUNSEL
4153-61735-0004 IT IS ALWAYS KNOWN THAT THIS ROAD PASSED THE HACIENDA OF CASA DEL CORVO AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER
4153-61735-0005 ON REACHING THE COPSE HE DISMOUNTED LED HIS HORSE IN AMONG THE UNDERWOOD HITCHED HIM BY LOOPING HIS BRIDLE REIN AROUND THE TOPMOST TWIGS OF AN ELASTIC BOW THEN DETACHING THE LONG ROPE OF TWISTED HORSEHAIR FROM THE HORN OF HIS SADDLE AND INSERTING HIS ARM INTO ITS COIL HE GLIDED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND ON THAT SIDE THAT LAY TOWARDS THE HACIENDA
4153-61735-0006 BEFORE FORSAKING THE SHADOW OF THE CORPS HE CAST A GLANCE TOWARD THE SKY AND AT THE MOON SAILING SUPREMELY OVER IT
4153-61735-0007 THE DROLL CONCEIT WHICH HAS SO OFT AMUSED THE NOCTURNAL INEBRIATE OF GREAT CITIES APPEARED TO PRODUCE A LIKE EFFECT UPON THE NIGHT PATROLLER OF THE PRAIRIE AND FOR A MOMENT THE SHADOW LATE DARKENING ITS BROW DISAPPEARED
4153-61735-0008 IT'S NOT LIKELY HOW THESE ARE UNLESS IT BE THE OWNER OF A BAD CONSCIENCE WHO CAN'T SLEEP
4153-61735-0009 TROTH THERE'S ONE SUCH WITHIN WHOSE WALLS
4153-61735-0010 IF HE CAN BE ABROAD THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF HIS SEEING ME ON THE OPEN GROUND NOT THAT I SHOULD CARE A STRAW IF IT WERE ONLY MYSELF TO BE COMPROMISED
4153-61735-0011 IT'S NO USE WAITING UPON THE MOON DEUCEDACS
4153-61735-0012 IT IS TRUE HE HAD DESIGNS UPON THE HACIENDA BUT THESE DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EITHER ITS CASH PLATE OR JEWELRY IF WE EXCEPT THE MOST PRECIOUS JEWEL IT CONTAINED THE MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HIMSELF
4323-13259-0000 THE CHURCH BELLS WERE RINGING AND PEOPLE ON THE AVENUE GOING BY TO SERVICE TURNED CURIOUS INQUIRING LOOKS UP AT THE GREAT HOUSE AND THEN WENT ON TALKING OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD SO STRANGELY ENTERED UPON AND MADE HISTORY IN THE CITY
4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSIONED APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE BOYS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
4323-13259-0002 RAYMOND HAD VOTED TO ENGAGE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SALOON
4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS WITH RAYMOND STOOD CONDEMNED BY THE RESULT
4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACTS IN RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULED
4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME PRIM BRIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
4323-13259-0006 HOW IF HE HAD BEGUN TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
4323-13259-0007 WHEN HAD THE WHOLE CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS
4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF OFFICE UNDISTURBED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELINGS THAT HE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WELLS OF LIFE
4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER IN RAIMENTS THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOR EVER
4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEETINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTANT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
4323-13259-0012 AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON AND ITS AWFUL CAUSE
4323-13259-0013 GRAY AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY EMPLOYERS WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO IN PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
4323-13259-0014 GRAY HAD GONE UP TO VIRGINIA'S ROOM AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER AND MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERALS SAID GREY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LAREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR DIRECTION IN THE MATTER
4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PAGE THINK MOST WILL BE RIGHT
4323-13259-0018 AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DISPLAY AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT EVENING A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN A NEIGHBORING CITY
4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES AND THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN HER PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND A CENTER OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALOONS
4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUEER PART OF THIS STRANGE VISIT
4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSD
4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD THAT MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY
4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS PHRONSIE TURNED FEARFULLY ROUND
4323-18416-0001 I'LL TRY AND SHE LAID HER QUICK HAND ON THE KNOB
4323-18416-0002 TWO RED SPOTS BURNED ON HIS CHEEKS AND HER PALE BLUE EYES SNAPPED
4323-18416-0003 FOR I'M SURE I HEARD IT RAGING UP AND DOWN
4323-18416-0004 I DON'T WANT ANY DINNER HERE SAID CHARLOTTE DRAWING BACK
4323-18416-0005 YES INDEED SAID POLLY CHEERILY JUST AS YOUNG AS CAN BE
4323-18416-0006 ASSUREDLY SAID OLD MISTER KING WITH GREAT SATISFACTION IN POLLY'S PLEASURE AND AT HER SUCCESS IN DRAWING CHARLOTTE DOWN
4323-18416-0007 AND AFTER THIS THERE WERE NO MORE QUIET DAYS FOR CHARLOTTE CHATTERSON
4323-18416-0008 OH YOU BLESS ME IT'S YOU PHRONSIE IN PLEASED SURPRISE
4323-18416-0009 YES GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE COMING IN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR CAREFULLY I CAME ON PURPOSE TO HEAR YOU ALL ALONE
4323-18416-0010 SO YOU DID DEAR SAID MISTER KINGE HIGHLY GRATIFIED AND PUSHING AWAY HIS WRITING TABLE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
4323-18416-0011 OH NO GRANDPAPA CRIED PHRONSIE IN A RAPTURE I COULD NEVER BE TOO WEAK FOR THAT SO SHE PERCHED UP AS OF OLD ON HIS KNEE THEN SHE FOLDED HER HANDS AND LOOKED GRAVELY IN HIS FACE
4323-18416-0012 WELL MY DEAR WHEN IS IT

4323-18416-0019 GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE WASN'T MISSUS CHATTERTON AUNT AT CHARLOTTE
4323-18416-0020 IF MISSUS CHATTERTON WAS AUNT TO CHARLOTTE PERSISTED PHRONSIE STILL IT SEEMS AS IF CHARLOTTE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF THE MONEY IT REALLY DOES GRANDPAPA
4323-18416-0021 MAYBE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A SHORT LAUGH AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF COUSIN EUNICE WAS SORRY WITH A FEW OTHER THINGS TOO PHRONSIE
4323-18416-0022 COULDN'T IT MAKE HER VERY GLAD IF I GAVE CHARLOTTE SOME OF THE MONEY
4323-18416-0023 FOR ANSWER MISTER KING SET HER DOWN QUICKLY ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK TWO OR THREE TURNS UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
4323-18416-0024 BUT I DO SO WISH I MIGHT SHE SAID THERE'S SO MUCH FOR A LITTLE GIRL LIKE ME

4323-18416-0028 THERE THERE MY SISTER'S BODY SHALL NEVER SAY THAT BUT COME IN COME IN

4323-18416-0034 I'VE BEEN A LAZY DOG ALL MY LIFE AND IS GOOD FOR NOUGHT BUT I HOPE I'VE NOT SUNK TO THAT
4323-55228-0000 THE NEXT MOMENT HE FELL BACK IN AMAZEMENT BEFORE AN IMPETUOUS RUSH OF A STARRY EYED FLUSHED CHEEKED YOUNG WOMAN WHO DEMANDED
4323-55228-0001 WHERE IS HE PETE MISS BILLY GASPED THE OLD WOMAN
4323-55228-0002 AUNT HANNAH'S CHEEKS TOO WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES STARRY BUT WITH DISMAY AND ANGER THE LAST BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PETE HAD ASKED MISS BILLY'S NAME
4323-55228-0003 IT WAS NOT MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO IT OF COURSE IT'S SHE
4323-55228-0004 RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE IS
4323-55228-0005 INTERPOSED BILLY TELL MISTER BERTRAM I'M HERE OR I'LL GO RIGHT IN AND SURPRISE HIM
4323-55228-0006 PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE TOWARDS AUNT HANNAH WHO
4323-55228-0007 MISS BILLY SAID BILLY YOU'RE AN ANGEL STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN YOU ARE YOU ARE OH I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME
4323-55228-0008 IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT HE'S IN HIS DEN MISS BILLY
4323-55228-0009 BILLY TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD TAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARD THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AUNT HANNAH'S INDIGNANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BUSY STOP
4323-55228-0010 PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHT
4323-55228-0011 BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN HE AWOKE
4323-55228-0012 A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES STOOD OPEN
4323-55228-0013 DONG LLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY
4323-55228-0014 IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GRAY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S APRON WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE
4323-55228-0015 THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT AT ALL
4323-55228-0016 AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT IT WAS USABLE
4323-55228-0017 WHY OF COURSE STAMMERED BILLY I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU HAD FOUND OUT YOU DIDN'T WANT IT
4323-55228-0018 DEMANDED BERTRAM ANGRY AND MYSTIFIED TOO
4323-55228-0019 AS FOR MY NOT PAINTING AGAIN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE DEAR WHY
4323-55228-0020 SHE PULLED HERSELF HALF AWAY FROM BERTRAM'S ENCIRCING ARM
4323-55228-0021 BUT BILLY DREW A QUIVERING SIGH
4323-55228-0022 GOOD HEAVENS IS KATE IN THIS SO BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS SAVAGE NOW
4323-55228-0023 I WELL SHE WROTE A LETTER
4323-55228-0024 BILLY LAUGHED GAILY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION BUT DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES
4323-55228-0025 AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MOMENT BILLIE THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM
4323-55228-0026 HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF OUR EYELIDS
4323-55228-0027 POLLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHTS
4323-55228-0028 AFTER A MINUTE BILLY ENTERED AND SIGHED HAPPILY
4323-55228-0029 THEN YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARKWRIGHT
4323-55228-0030 AND AND YOU DIDN'T CARE SPECIALLY FOR FOR ME WINTHROP
4323-55228-0031 BILLY PUT A SOFT HAND ON HIS LIPS
4323-55228-0032 MISS BERTRAM KISSED THE FINGER AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED
4323-55228-0033 WELL WHAT IS THAT IS THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM BRIGHTLY
4323-55228-0034 AND THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERTRAM STIRRED
4323-55228-0035 OH BILLY I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY
4323-55228-0036 I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL NOW YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY
4323-55228-0037 I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW I'LL GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUNDED THAT LAW I FORGOT
4323-55228-0038 I FIVE DAYS INDEED SIR
4323-55228-0039 I WONDER IF YOU' THINK I CAN GET READY TO BE MARRIED IN FIVE DAYS
4323-55228-0040 DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY INTERRUPTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT
4323-55228-0041 IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE BUTS
4323-55228-0042 BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAM CRAFTILY AND
4323-55228-0043 THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S GRAVE EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT
4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GOOD LEFT ARM
4323-55228-0045 TILLIE MY DEAR
4323-55228-0046 IT WAS OLD HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER
4323-55228-0047 WE MUST GO TO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU
4323-55228-0048 SO YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE OCTOBER
4323-55228-0049 AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNCERTAINTY
4323-55228-0050 YES NODDED PHILIP DEMURELY
4323-55228-0051 YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM MERRIAM
4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE HALL
4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A GREAT FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFILL
4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY COULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS CELLAR DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THE RAW ATTACHMENT
4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE HAD LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK
4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S SISTER
4515-11057-0006 HE WROTE TO MARIANI
4515-11057-0007 WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME AND SEE IT
4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFING AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
4515-11057-0009 THEN WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
4515-11057-0010 I HOPED YOU HAD BRING ME SOME NEWS
4515-11057-0011 POVERTY I CAN ONLY SPEAK
4515-11057-0012 BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE AND HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFIN FOR A LONG TIME
4515-11057-0013 WAS HE STILL SO VERY POOR AND
4515-11057-0014 ASKED AMY A COMPASSIONATELY
4515-11057-0015 I I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY
4515-11057-0016 OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURE I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT RECKLESS LOVE
4515-11057-0018 HE HAD SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT THEIR EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
4515-11057-0020 AH AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN
4515-11057-0021 ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH HIS BLINDNESS
4515-11057-0022 IS IT SO SERIOUSLY
4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK AS BEFORE
4515-11057-0024 OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT IN
4515-11057-0025 HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND STEAL DESPONDENTLY
4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILLS YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE
4515-11057-0027 FOR THERE WAS SILENCE
4515-11057-0028 THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
4515-11057-0029 RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW HIM
4515-11057-0030 FIRST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT
4515-11057-0031 YOU YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN MY WORK RECENTLY
4515-11057-0032 DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CURRENT AND SO ON CERTAINLY
4515-11057-0033 SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WERE NO SIGNATURE
4515-11057-0034 HER STORE IN THAT GIRL'S PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
4515-11057-0035 AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT YOU AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
4515-11057-0036 I SURMISE THAT BUT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
4515-11057-0037 DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE SAID
4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS WERE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT CAN I DO
4515-11057-0039 THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY DEFENCE
4515-11057-0040 WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRIBBLIN
4515-11057-0041 AGAIN JASPER HELD UP THE WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT
4515-11057-0042 YET FOR SOME FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY
4515-11057-0043 MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE FROM HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER OWN HEART
4515-11057-0045 HE BEGAN ABRUPT
4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN SHE ADDED
4515-11057-0047 THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS ALONE IN THE BATTLE
4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN OF WHAT
4515-11057-0049 THEN YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER
4515-11057-0050 SO OF A BRUTE YOU MEAN
4515-11057-0051 YOU KNOW VERY VERY WELL I DON'T
4515-11057-0052 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON QUIETLY
4515-11057-0053 YOU
4515-11057-0054 WILL YOU REMEMBER ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE
4515-11057-0055 YOU CAN FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT
4515-11057-0056 I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER TO
4515-11057-0057 SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM DOUBTFULLY
4515-11057-0058 WELL I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND
4515-11057-0059 WHY ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU
4515-11057-0060 WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAE
4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN OR WHAT IS BEFORE HIM
4515-11057-0062 SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REPLIED
4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY OF YOU WHEN YOU WERE MY WIFE
4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WELL THEN HERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
4515-11057-0065 EXCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS JEALOUS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT
4515-11057-0066 DO YOU THINK THAT INSURMOUNTABLE
4515-11057-0067 THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIANNE YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH
4515-11057-0068 NO I DON'T TRUST MYSELF
4515-11057-0069 BUT SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILLINGLY THEN
4515-11057-0070 TO PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MARIAN
4515-11057-0071 WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE MADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN HER
4515-11057-0073 WHY MAY YOU CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0074 IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUSTED YOURSELF
4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARIAN THEN
4515-11057-0076 HOW AM I TO LIVE MY HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS
4515-11057-0077 I DO SO WISH IT
4515-11057-0078 YOUR EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED
4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER LIFE FOR HER PARENTS
4515-11057-0080 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME AND
4515-11057-0081 AND IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY FATHER
4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIAN I CAN'T STAND YOU
4515-11057-0083 I WILL BE FAITHFULR TO YOU
4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENSE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HIM BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
4515-11057-0085 MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING OH
4515-11057-0086 IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHLINESS
4515-11057-0087 BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH ANXIETY AS THIS
4515-11057-0088 YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER OR THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
4515-11057-0089 HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY HER FATE
4515-11057-0090 IS IT IN MY OWN POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
4515-11057-0091 BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAD IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
4515-11057-0092 IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I DO BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU
4515-11057-0093 WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID HOW
4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES AGAIN THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO
4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST HER
4515-11057-0096 WHATEVER CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH
4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THIS TRUTH
4515-11057-0098 MARIANE WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME
4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH YOU
4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT THERE BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST
4515-11057-0101 JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY YOU
4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM YES SIR
4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARIANA YOU CAN'T WORK
4515-11057-0104 I MUST AND THEN I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
4515-11057-0105 GOOD BYE SHE GAVE ME HER HAND
4515-11057-0106 THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY ALONG
4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATIONS
4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TONES IN ASPECT
4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY THEM
4515-11057-0110 AND YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURELY YOU NEED NO FURTHER PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
4515-11057-0112 YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF YOUR OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY AND
4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TRAVELS TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THAT PROBLEM
4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE WESTERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDERY WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT ONE FROM CIVIL LIFE
4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION AND
4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH A RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTEED TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY PARTICULAR ISSUE
4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF EYES
4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A GRACEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOURS IT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
4570-14911-0003 BUT PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE LIFTED TO THEIR WORK
4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH A LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HOUND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS
4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLES
4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTER HOUNDS TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE

4831-25894-0033 LITTLE RONZIO WAS ACCEPTED WITH DELIGHT BY THE KIND LADY AND HER CHILDREN AND TESSA LEARNED THE SONG QUITE EASILY
4831-25894-0034 AROSE FROM THE CROWD OF CHILDREN GATHERED THROUGH THE FESTIVAL
4831-25894-0035 BEFORE THEY WENT HOME THE KIND EMMA TOLD TESSA SHE SHOULD BE HER FRIEND AND GAVE HER A MOTHERLY KISS WHICH WARMED THE CHILD'S HEART AND SEEMED TO SET A SEAL UPON THAT PROMISE
4831-29134-0000 THE SENATOR TOOK HIS SEAT ON THE PULPIT WITH THE MINISTER ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL ON THE OTHER
4831-29134-0001 SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE PRESENCE OF A LIVING UNITED STATES SENATOR THAT DURING THREE MINUTES NOT A SPIT BOWL WAS THROWN
4831-29134-0002 AFTER THAT THEY BEGAN TO COME TO THEMSELVES BY DEGREES BUT PRESENTLY THE SPELL WAS WHOLLY GONE AND THEY WERE RECITING VERSES AND PULLING HAIR
4831-29134-0003 THE USUAL SUNDAY SCHOOL EXERCISES WERE HURRIED THROUGH AND THEN THE MINISTER GOT UP AND BORED THE HOUSE WITH A SPEECH BUILT OF THE CUSTOMARY SUNDAY SCHOOL PLAN THEN THE SUPERINTENDENT PUT IN HIS OAR THEN THE TOWN DIGNITARIES HAD THEIR SAY

4831-29134-0012 ALWAYS LOVE YOUR TEACHERS MY CHILDREN FOR THEY LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN DO NOW
4831-29134-0013 AND BY AND BY THE PEOPLE MADE HIM EMPEROR AND HE SAID IT WAS ALL OWING TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
4831-29134-0014 WHY THE PEOPLE GAVE HIM A TOWERING ILLUSTRIOUS POSITION THE GRAND IMPOSING POSITION
4831-29134-0015 IT WAS SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES A
4831-29134-0016 THAT POOR LITTLE BOY THAT LEFT HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL BECAME THAT MAN AND MAN STANDS BEFORE YOU
4831-29134-0017 ABOVE ALL THINGS MY CHILDREN' BE HONEST
4831-29134-0018 WHEN SENATOR DILWORTHY DEPARTED FROM CADETVILLE HE LEFT THREE DOZEN BOYS BEHIND HIM ARRANGING A CAMPAIGN OF LIFE WHOSE OBJECTIVE POINT WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATE
5543-27761-0000 LO LETCHKA WAS A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
5543-27761-0001 THERE WAS NO OTHER SUCH CHILD THERE NEVER HAD BEEN AND THAT NEVER WOULD BE
5543-27761-0002 LUISCHKA'S MOTHER SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA WAS SURE OF THAT
5543-27761-0003 LULLETIEKA'S EYES WERE DARK AND LARGE HER CHEEKS WERE ROSY HER LIPS WERE MADE FOR KISSES AND FOR LAUGHTER
5543-27761-0004 BUT IT WAS NOT THESE CHARMS IN LAELETSKA THAT GAVE HER MOTHER THE KEENEST JOY
5543-27761-0005 SHE FELT COLD AND HER HUSBAND
5543-27761-0006 HE WAS ALWAYS FRESH AND COOL WITH A FRIGID SMILE AND WHEREVER HE PASSED COLD COMFORTS SEEMED TO MOVE IN THE AIR
5543-27761-0007 IT EVEN SEEMED TO SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER FUTURE HUSBAND AND THIS MADE HER UNHAPPY
5543-27761-0008 THAT BRIDE WAS ALSO GOOD LOOKING SHE WAS A TALL DARK EYED DARK HAIRED GIRL SOMEWHAT TIMID BUT VERY TACTFUL
5543-27761-0009 HE HAD CONNECTIONS AND HIS WIFE CAME OF GOOD INFLENTIAL PEOPLE
5543-27761-0010 THIS I MIGHT AT THE PROPER OPPORTUNITY PROVE USEFUL
5543-27761-0011 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MANNER OF SERGEY MOROSTOVITCH TO SUGGEST ANYTHING WRONG IN HIS WIFE
5543-27761-0012 LATER HOWEVER WHEN HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD SERGEY MOYSTOVITCH ESTABLISHED CONNECTIONS ELSEWHERE OF A LIGHT AND TEMPORARY NATURE
5543-27761-0013 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA FOUND THIS OUT AND TO HER OWN ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY HURT SHE AWAITED HER INFANTS WITH A RESTLESS ANTICIPATION THAT SWALLOWED EVERY OTHER FEELING
5543-27761-0014 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA DRIFTED FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM IT
5543-27761-0015 DOTCHKA THEN RAN AWAY STAMPING WITH HER PLUMP LITTLE LEGS OVER THE CARPETS AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR HER BED
5543-27761-0016 WHERE IS MY BABY GIRL THE MOTHER ASKED AS SHE LOOKED FOR A LUOLACHKA AND MADE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID NOT SEE HER
5543-27761-0017 THEN SHE CAME OUT A LITTLE FARTHER AND HER MOTHER AS THOUGH SHE HAD ONLY JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SEIZED HER BY HER LITTLE SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED JOYOUSLY HERE SHE IS MY LATCH
5543-27761-0018 HER SON'S EYES GLOWED WITH PASSIONATE EMOTION
5543-27761-0019 HER MOTHER WAS TO HIDE
5543-27761-0020 LUTCHKA TURNED AWAY AS THOUGH NOT TO SEE BUT WATCHED HER MAMMOUCHKA STEALTHILY ALL THE TIME
5543-27761-0021 WHERE'S MY MA MOCHKA ASKED LUETSHKA
5543-27761-0022 A SMILE OF ABSOLUTE BLISS PLAYED ON A RED LIPS
5543-27761-0023 A LETCHKA WAS GETTING NEAR HER MOTHER'S CORNER
5543-27761-0024 HER MOTHER WAS GROWING MORE ABSORBED EVERY MOMENT BY HER INTEREST IN THE GAME HER HEART BEAT WITH SHORT QUICK STROKES AND SHE PRESSED EVEN CLOSER TO THE WALL DISARRANGING HER HAIR STILL
5543-27761-0025 VALEDKA SUDDENLY GLANCED TOWARDS HER MOTHER'S CORNER AND SCREAMED WITH JOY
5543-27761-0026 THROUGH THE HALF CLOSED DOORS HE HEARD THE LAUGHTER OF THE JOYOUS OUTCRIES THE SOUND OF ROMPING
5543-27761-0027 EVEN PHODOSIA FELT ABASHED NOW FOR HER MISTRESS NOT FOR HERSELF
5543-27761-0028 HE LIKED COMING THERE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED THIS WAS DONE BY SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA WHO WISHED TO SURROUND HER LITTLE GIRL FROM HER VERY INFANCY ONLY WITH THE LOVELIEST THINGS
5543-27761-0029 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA DRESSED HERSELF TASTEFULLY THIS TOO SHE DID FOR LUOLETCHKA WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW
5543-27761-0030 ONE THING SERGEY MODOSTOVITCH HAD NOT BEEN RECONCILED TO AND THIS WAS HIS WIFE'S ALMOST CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN THE NURSERY
5543-27761-0031 IT'S JUST AS I THOUGHT I KNEW AND I'D FIND YOU HERE HE SAID WITH A DERISIVE AND CONDESCENDING SMILE
5543-27761-0032 MERELY YOU ASK THAT THE CHILD SHOULD FEEL ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY HE EXPLAINED IN ANSWER TO SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA'S PUZZLED GLANCE
5543-27761-0033 SHE'S STILL SO WELL SAID SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0034 I DON'T INSIST IT'S YOUR FREEDOM HERE
5543-27761-0035 I'LL THINK IT OVER HIS WIFE ANSWERED SMILING AS HE DID A COLDLY BUT GENIALLY
5543-27761-0036 THEN THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF THINGS ELSE
5543-27761-0037 THAT THE MISTRESS SAYS IT WELL THAT'S ONE THING BUT THAT THE YOUNG LADY DOES IT THAT'S BAD
5543-27761-0038 WHY ASKED FEDOSINA WITH CURIOSITY
5543-27761-0039 THIS EXPRESSION OF CURIOSITY GAVE HER FACE THE LOOK OF A WOODEN ROUGHLY PAINTED DOLL AND
5543-27761-0040 YES THAT'S BAD REPEATED AGATHYW WITH CONVICTION TERRIBLY BAD WELL
5543-27761-0041 IT'S THE TRUTH I'M SAYING AND REMEMBER MY WORDS AGATHEA WENT ON WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE AND SECRECY
5543-27761-0042 IT'S THE SUREST SIGN'
5543-27761-0043 THE OLD WOMAN HAS INVENTED THIS SIGN QUITE SUDDENLY HERSELF AND SHE WAS EVIDENTLY VERY PROUD OF IT
5543-27761-0044 MADAME MADAME SHE SAID KINDLY IN A TREMBLING VOICE
5543-27761-0045 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA GIVE A START
5543-27761-0046 FEDOSIA'S FACE MADE HER CONSCIOUS
5543-27761-0047 WHAT IS IT FEDOSYA SHE ASKED WITH GREAT CONCERN IS THERE ANY THING WRONG WITH LULLETSHKA
5543-27761-0048 NO MADAME SAID PHILDOSIA AS SHE GESTICULATED WITH HER HANDS TO REASSURE HER MISTRESS AND TO MAKE HER SIT DOWN
5543-27761-0049 LUDKA'S ASLEEP MAY GOD BE WITH HER
5543-27761-0050 ONLY I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING YOU SEE LULLETSHKA IS ALWAYS HIDING HERSELF THAT IS NO GOOD
5543-27761-0051 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BAD IT IS SAID FEDOXIA AND HER FACE EXPRESSED THE MOST DECIDED CONFIDENCE
5543-27761-0052 I I UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
5543-27761-0053 YOU SEE MADAM IT'S A KIND OF OMEN EXPLAINS FEDOSYO ABRUPTLY IN A SHAMEFACED WAY
5543-27761-0054 NO NONSENSE SAID SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0055 WHO TOLD YOU OF THIS ASKED SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA IN AN AUSTERE LOW VOICE
5543-27761-0056 THUS EXCLAIMED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA IN IRRITATION AS THOUGH SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HERSELF SOMEHOW FROM THIS SUDDEN ANXIETY
5543-27761-0057 WHAT NONSENSE AS THOUGH LULL LETCHKA COULD DIE
5543-27761-0058 SHE SAW CLEARLY THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE CONNEXION BETWEEN A CHILD'S QUITE ORDINARY DIVERSION AND THE CONTINUATION OF THAT CHILD'S LIFE
5543-27761-0059 SHE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT THAT EVENING TO OCCUPY HER MIND WITH OTHER MATTERS BUT HER THOUGHTS TURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO THE FACT THAT LO LETCHKA LOVED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0060 WHEN LUBOTSHKA WAS STILL QUITE SMALL AND HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HER NURSE SHE SOMETIMES SITTING IN HER NURSE'S ARMS MADE A SUDDEN ROGUISH GRIMACE AND HID HER LAUGHING FACE AT THE NURSE'S SHOULDER
5543-27761-0061 THEN SHE WOULD LOOK OUT FOR A SLY GLANCE
5543-27761-0062 THOUGH SHE REPROACHED HERSELF AT ONCE FOR THIS UNFOUNDED SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD NOT ENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF LUTCHKA'S FAVOURITE GAME AND SHE TRIED TO DIVERT LUETCHKA'S ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE
5543-27761-0063 SHE EAGERLY COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S MANY WISHES
5543-27761-0064 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA TRIED DESPERATELY TO AMUSE LOETCHKA
5543-27761-0065 PERHAPS THOUGHT SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA SHE IS NOT AS STRONGLY DRAWN IN THE WORLD AS OTHER CHILDREN WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY MANY THINGS
5543-27761-0066 IF THIS IS SO IS IT NOT A SOUND OF ORGANIC WEAKNESS
5543-27761-0067 SARAFIMMA ALEXANDROVNA HERSELF BEGAN THE GAME ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH SHE PLAYED IT WITH A HEAVY HEART
5543-27761-0068 SHE SUFFERED AS THOUGH COMMITTING AN EVIL DEED WITH SUCH CONSCIOUSNESS
5543-27761-0069 BUT IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA
5543-27761-0070 HIS MOTHER COVERED HER WITH A BLUE BLANKET
5543-27761-0071 LUDUTSKA DREW HER SWEET LITTLE HANDS FROM UNDER THE BLANKET AND STRETCHED THEM OUT TO EMBRACE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER BENT DOWN
5543-27761-0072 SHE SEEMED SO SMALL AND SO FRAIL UNDER HER BLANKET THAT COVERED HER
5543-27761-0073 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA REMAINED STANDING OVER LUETZKA'S BED A LONG WHILE AND SHE KEPT LOOKING AT LUETCHKA WITH TENDERNESS AND FEAR
5543-27761-0074 I'M A MOTHER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT HER SHE THOUGHT AS SHE IMAGINED THE VARIOUS ILLS THAT MIGHT BEFALL AATSHKA
5543-27761-0075 SHE PRAYED SO LONG THAT NIGHT BUT THE PRAYER DID NOT RELIEVE HER SADNESS
5543-27761-0076 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED LUSETZKA CAUGHT COLD
5543-27761-0077 HIS FEVER CAME UPON HER AT NIGHT
5543-27761-0078 WHEN SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA AWAKENED BY FEDOSYA CAME TO LUALETCHKA AND SAW HER LOOKING SO HOT SO RESTLESS AND SO TORMENTED SHE INSTANTLY RECALLED THE EVIL OMEN AND A HOPELESS DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS
5543-27761-0079 A DOCTOR WAS CALLED AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS BUT THIS INEVITABLE HAPPENED
5543-27761-0080 AND LU NOTCHKA GREW FEEBLER FROM HOUR TO HOUR
5543-27761-0081 NOTHING MADE HER SO UNHAPPY AS THE REITERATIONS OF FEDOSYA UTTERED BETWEEN SOBS SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF AROYLECHKA
5543-27761-0082 FEVER WAS CONSUMING LUILETCHKA AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND SPOKE IN DELIRIUM
5543-27761-0083 THREE DAYS PASSED TORTURING BY A NIGHTMARE
5543-27761-0084 SARAHIMA ALEXANDROVNA HID HER FACE BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR LULETSKA'S BED HOW TRAGIC
5543-27761-0085 WAIT MA MOTCHKA WHISPERED LULUTZKA
5543-27761-0086 MOMOTZKA'S WHITE FACE BECAME BLURRED AND EVERYTHING GREW DARK BEFORE LULLETSHKA
5543-27761-0087 SHE MET HER HUSBAND THEN
5543-27761-0088 SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA WAS STANDING BY THE COFFIN AND LOOKING DULLY ON HER DEAD CHILD
5543-27761-0089 SIYA MY DEAR DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF SAID SERGEY MOLOSTOVITCH IN A WHISPER
5543-27761-0090 WE MUST RESIGN YOURSELF TO YOUR FATE
5543-27761-0091 SHE'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE INSISTED SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA HER EYES FIXED ON THE DEAD LITTLE GIRL
5543-27761-0092 SERGEY MOOSTOOVITCH LOOKED ROUND HIM CAUTIOUSLY HE WAS AFRAID OF THE UNSEEMLY AND OF THE RIDICULOUS
5543-27761-0093 SIMA DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF HE RETURNED
5543-27761-0094 HE WAS CONFUSED AND ANNOYED THEN
5543-27761-0095 HER FACE SEEMED TRANQUIL AND HER EYES WERE DULL
5543-27761-0096 SHE WENT INTO THE NURSERY AND BEGAN TO WALK ROUND THE ROOM LOOKING INTO THOSE PLACES WHERE LUOLETCHKA USED TO HIDE HERSELF
5543-27761-0097 SHE WALKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND BENT NOW AND THEN TO LOOK UNDER THE TABLE OR UNDER THE BED AND KEPT ON REPEATING CHEERFULLY WHERE'S MY LITTLE ONE WHERE IS MY LUTLETCHKA
5543-27761-0098 AFTER SHE HAD WALKED ROUND THE ROOM ONCE SHE BEGAN TO MAKE HER CHOICE ANEW
5543-27761-0099 FEDOSYA MOTIONLESS WITH DEJECTED FACE SAT IN A CORNER AND LOOKED FRIGHTENED AT HER MISTRESS THEN SHE SUDDENLY BURST OUT SOBBING BUT SHE WAILED LOUDLY
5543-27761-0100 SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LUILATCHKA ER ANGELIC LITTLE SOUL
5543-27761-0101 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOR THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE BETWEEN HER AND LUTCHEDKA
5543-27761-0102 THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF HEAVINESS IN SARAFIMA ALEXANDROVNA'S HEAD AS SHE APPROACHED LALLETCHKA
5543-27761-0103 WOLLOTCHKA LAY THERE STILL AND PALE AND SMILED PATHETICALLY
5543-27761-0104 THEIR LITTLE ONE DID NOT REPLY
5543-27761-0105 SARAFINA ALEXANDROVNA STOOD UP ERECT SIGHED IN A LOST WAY SMILED AND CALLED LOUDLY LULEDCHKA
5543-27761-0106 LULESCHKA IS BEING CARRIED OUT
5849-50873-0000 CAP'N BALL THE COMMANDER OF A SMALL GARRISON AT SEBROOK PERMITTED HIM TO LAND BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO READ HIS COMMISSIONS BILL ORDERED HIM TO BE SILENT
5849-50873-0001 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MISTER PRINCE WADSWORTH ASKED FOR HE COULD SEE THAT THE MAN WAS GREATLY EXCITED GOVERNOR ANDROSE HAS COME AGAIN GASPED MISTER PRINCE WHY SHOULD THAT ALARM US THE FELLOW SO GIVEN TO BOASTING IS NOT DANGEROUS OR LIABLE TO PUT HIS THREATS INTO EXECUTION BUT HE HAS GROWN DANGEROUS DECLARED MISTER PRINCE THE LIBERTIES OF THE COLONY ARE INVOLVED
5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WALLSWORTH BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY THOUGH HE WAS STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THE MATTER LIGHTLY
5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF MY POLITICAL RIGHTS
5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VICREROY HAS COME TO HARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WANSWORTH BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD DECLARED HE SHALL NOT HAVE IT
5849-50873-0006 THIS DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN A HEATED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO AWAIT THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD GIVE THE CHARTER
5849-50873-0008 AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED A
5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY DOING ENGAGED INTO A DEBATE
5849-50873-0010 AND WILL HE WAIT UNTIL IT IS ENDED HE WAS PROMISED TO DO SO
5849-50873-0011 MISTER PRINCE FIXED HIS AMAZED EYES ON THE CAPTAIN'S FACE AND READ THERE A DESPERATE DETERMINATION CAPTAIN HE BEGIN
5849-50873-0012 MISTER KRINZ BOWED AND HASTILY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE THE ASSEMBLY WAS IN SESSION
5849-50873-0013 AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE FRANZ STEVENS SAID

5849-50873-0016 WHICH DO YOU INTEND DOING UNCLE WILL YOU FIGHT THEM
5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THE WORK TO BE DONE RIGHT AT THE TIME NOT TOO SOON NOR TOO LATE
5849-50873-0018 THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE CAPTAIN SAID HE
5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO MY ASSEMBLY
5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS AS I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR MISSION
5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PLACE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN WATERSWORTH
5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT AS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES' AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING SPECIAL ATTENTION
5849-50873-0023 THE DESTRUCTION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE IN TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATIONED NEARER THEM
5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHT THROUGH THE WINDOW THE FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOWED HIM AS RAPIDLY AS HE SHOULD
5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE ONE SEIZED HIS ARM
5849-50873-0028 BOY HAVE THAT CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WADSWORTH THE TRAIN VANCE CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THEIR SOLDIERS
5849-50873-0030 WHERE IS THE CHARSTER
5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HAVE THE TRAINBANDS ON CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
5849-50873-0032 WHO OF YOU HAS THE CHAR
5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY CRIED THE ENRAGED GRANDFATHER
5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY SHOOK THEIR LEGS
5849-50873-0035 AND WE DO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVE IN CONNECTICUT WHERE DOES HE LIVE
5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL ASSISTANT DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE YOUNG TREE HISTORIC
5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DONKEY WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARDS KNOWN AS THE CHARTER OAK
5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF SAND
5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER IN THE SEIZURE OF THE CHARTERS WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN THE ASSEMBLY OF RHODE ISLANDS SENT A MOST LOYAL ADDRESS TO THE KING SAYING
5849-50873-0040 HE FORMALLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND AT THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE FORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENSE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORNE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THEIR FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTER TO THE EXPULSION OF ANDROPS
5849-50962-0000 CALLED BERT WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGES
5849-50962-0001 IT'S THAT SCHOONER SAID MISTER BINGHAM TO MISTER MINTURN AND SHE HAS A VERY HEAVY CARGO

5849-50962-0004 THAT'S THE DIRECTION I SAID HAL
5849-50962-0005 THEY ARE PRINTED IN A COUPLE OF LANGUAGES AND THEY TELL THE CREW TO CARRY THE END OF THE CABLE HIGH UP TO THE MAST AND FASTEN IT STRONGLY THERE
5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BERT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BUOY WE WILL GO OUT ON A PULLEY
5849-50962-0007 IT WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MUCH OF THE WICKED STORE HAD PASSED
5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS AND WOMEN TO THE CHURCH
5849-50962-0009 MISSUS BOBBSEY MISSUS MINTURN NELLIE AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND NAN WERE ALL THERE FLOSSIE AND FREDDIE BEING OBLIGED TO STAY UP WITH DINAH AND SUSAN
5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT BERT AND HAL TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BUOY WAS PREPARING
5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER IT CAME UNTIL HERE A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMEN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO THEIR MOTHER
5849-50962-0014 A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFEGUARDS AND A MAN IN THAT CORK BELT BANDED UPON SHORE
5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND NELLIE WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HEART BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
5849-50962-0016 OH IT IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FALLING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
5849-50962-0017 BUT THAT HALF DROWNED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
5849-50962-0018 AND DOES GEORGE BINGHAM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED HER BROTHER
5849-50962-0019 FOR SAFE AND WELL CAME THE WELCOME ANSWER
5849-50962-0020 I GUESS OUR PRAYERS WERE HEARD LAST NIGHT AND
5849-50962-0021 HERE COMES ANOTHER MAN EXCLAIMED THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A BIG MAN DASHED INTO THE SANDS
5849-50962-0022 WHILE I'D DECLARE WE DID LAND UPON A FRIENDLY SHORE
5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BINGHAM HAD SAID THE LIFE SAVING WORK TURNED OUT TO BE A SOCIAL AFFAIR FOR THERE WAS A GREAT TIME GREETING NELLIE'S FATHER AND HAL'S UNCLE
5849-50962-0024 AND HAL AND HIS FATHER TOO PUT IN NANN
5849-50962-0025 WHAT A MORNING THAT WAS AT SUNSET BEACHER
5849-50962-0026 I'M SO GLAD WE PRAYED SAID LITTLE FLOSSIE TO FREDDIE WHEN THEY HEARD THE GOOD NEWS
5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THE DREADFUL STORMS
5849-50963-0001 AND HE WAS SO HAPPY
5849-50963-0002 THE NEPTUNE THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SAND BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROWBOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY LIKED
5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND WHEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A FEVER
5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT DELAYED US TWO
5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EVERY LOG LOADED ON THE SCHOONER AND WE STARTED BACK
5849-50963-0006 WE COUNTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORE STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE
5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE ASKED MISTER BOBBSY WHO WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY
5849-50963-0008 OF THE VALUE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
5849-50963-0009 WELL I'M A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY KATE MC GLAUGHLAN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
5849-50963-0010 NOW INDEED IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US A LIFETIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN THIS YEAR
5849-50963-0011 MAYBE AUNT EMILY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON OUR SHOPPING TOUR SUGGESTED NAN
5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERKS REMOVE ALL THE TRUCKS FROM THE AISLES AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE CITY FELL DOWN
5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FACED AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS FIRST EXERCISE
5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BYE TO YOU NELLIE TOLD DOROTHY AND NAN THEN NEXT MORNING
5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDIDLY DECLARED NAN
5849-50964-0002 YOU'RE QUITE RICH NOW AREN'T YOU REPLIED DOROTHY
5849-50964-0003 AND DOROTHY WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S BRIGHT SISTERS
5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE IN HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DOROTHY
5849-50964-0005 COME NELLIE CALLED MISSUS MC GLAUGHLAN I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAND
5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NELIE TOLD HIM
5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE ME THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
5849-50964-0008 MOST OF EM I GUESSES ANSWERED BERT
5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A LITTLE VACATION AND I AM WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED NANNI VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FREDDY AND FLOSSIE ARE BUSY PACKING UP
5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER OF THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT
5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL HER VACATION
6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL IN THE EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
6123-59150-0001 IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBER
6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF HUMOR
6123-59150-0003 CERTAINLY NOT THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL MORTAL
6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY'RE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT
6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LAST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LAST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
6123-59150-0007 DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE OF NEKHLUDOFF ON RESURRECTION
6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MAD HOUSE CRIED SOME ONE IN THE IDIERS
6123-59150-0009 ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION AND
6123-59150-0010 EVEN THOUGH TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
6123-59150-0011 HE SAW AS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SUCK
6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NEVER TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND AND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
6123-59150-0014 HE THEN PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY
6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ENNA CARRENNINA OR FATHERS AND SONS
6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THIS CRIME
6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY WITH PASSION
6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE THE ARTIST'S AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS THIS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES
6123-59150-0020 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BROTHER MANIACS
6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHFULLY
6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND TELL HIM
6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A PECULIAR AUTHOR
6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT THE INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
6123-59150-0026 DODSTAEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFFIEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEOKONSKI AGLAYA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VAYA FERUSHENKO NASTASYA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL VOLGAN
6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS IN CHARACTERS
6123-59150-0029 MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND HELPS THE DEFINITION
6123-59150-0030 TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT WAS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SOUTHERN DARKNESS
6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO LEARN
6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE THEY ARE PERMITTED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
6123-59150-0034 THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE AND
6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRIT OR CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL IN DESPAIR
6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CERTREVOS
6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MIND UNBELIEF
6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASS
6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MISHCHKIN IN THE IDIOT
6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF SUCH TERRIBLE CONFLICT
6123-59150-0041 THE NUMBERS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUVAY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIALS OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN OF THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS
6123-59150-0045 THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES AROUND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS
6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS US
6123-59186-0000 HE IS NOT BY THE TEMPERAMENT A SINGER
6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND THE STORM
6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDY HE IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL LINES OR IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0004 THUS HE WRITES IN AND I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
6123-59186-0005 THERE COULD NOT BE ANY UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE
6123-59186-0006 AND PERSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM OUT
6123-59186-0008 WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE HIS THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
6123-59186-0009 CATERING CARE IS AN APPALLED PHRASE
6123-59186-0010 IS THIS LINE OF GOOD POETRY
6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MATE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME
6123-59186-0012 THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUYLE MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
6123-59186-0013 HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT POSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
6123-59186-0014 ONE MAY REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW
6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN CROWNING'S TRAGEDIES
6123-59186-0016 HIS HEART IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY
6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENTS
6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDES'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWING COLD TO ME COULD LORNLY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY
6123-59186-0020 BUT THE TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDIER'S POEMS THE OXEN
6123-59186-0022 WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STORY PAN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN
6123-59186-0023 THE MOODS OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOOD
6123-59186-0024 YOU CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY
6123-59186-0025 HOW HARD HE CRIES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO
6123-59186-0026 WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWING GODLIKE SCORNED TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS
6123-59186-0027 BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION THE SENIOR SOULS FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE
6123-59186-0028 AND GENERAL HELLO HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES
6123-59186-0029 SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND IT NEW LOVES
6123-59186-0030 AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DWELLS THEY ON OUR DEEDS
6123-59186-0031 MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THAT GLORY OF WAR
6123-59186-0032 THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH THE WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE
6123-59186-0033 IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDEEA'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE
6123-59186-0034 THE FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH
6123-59186-0035 HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS SOUGHT IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY
6123-59186-0036 I LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH
6123-59186-0037 FROM BEYOND THE LAST LAMP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE
6123-59186-0038 NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE THE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL UNTO YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES
6123-59186-0039 THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER AS OUR OWN
6123-59186-0040 NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF ALL HUED DAYS
6267-53049-0000 IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T THAT
6267-53049-0001 PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE AULD SISTER WISTFULLY
6267-53049-0002 DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT NIGHT
6267-53049-0003 SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMIRED IT TO THE WORLD
6267-53049-0004 SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO SAY A NEW DEATH
6267-53049-0005 DORIS HUNTER I BELIEVE IT'S AN OLD QUIRK
6267-53049-0006 BUT LISTEN PENELOPE MY DEAR DORIS
6267-53049-0007 LOVE TO PENELOPE AND YOURSELVES
6267-53049-0008 YOURS AFFECTIONATE AUNT ADELA HUNTER
6267-53049-0009 I DON'T SEE THIS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A GREAT
6267-53049-0010 IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL DECIDED NOW
6267-53049-0011 TELL ME DO BERRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN
6267-53049-0012 IT WAS VERY KIND OF OUR AUNT ADELA TO SEND IT SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY
6267-53049-0013 WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT ONE EXCLAIMED PENELOPE
6267-53049-0014 WHAT LOVELY OLD TIMEY STUFF AND NOT A BIT FATED
6267-53049-0015 I DECLARE IT IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER
6267-53049-0016 WELL LET US GO AND HAVE CHIAT SAID PENELOPE I'VE DECIDEDLY HUNGRY
6267-53049-0017 BESIDES I SEE THE POVERTY BOGER COMING
6267-53049-0018 IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSES AND HISIR LOOM AFTER ALL
6267-53049-0019 PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEARTED COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY AND THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS THE POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET
6267-53049-0020 BUT PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE
6267-53049-0021 BUT PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER CHARMING
6267-53049-0022 SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE I SAID TO HERSELF
6267-53049-0023 MY AUNT ADELA GAVE ME GAVE US OUR MATERIALS SHE STAMMERED
6267-53049-0024 I'M NAMED AFTER HER MISSUS FAIRWATER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVELY OLD FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND KINDNESS
6267-53049-0025 THEN YOU ARE MY KIND NIECE SHE SAID
6267-53049-0026 WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT ROSE BUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN THIBETT
6267-53049-0027 PENELOPE SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER
6267-53049-0028 SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR COUNTRY HOLD WAS BROKEN UP
6267-53049-0029 MY DEAR I AM A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONG TO ME
6267-53049-0030 NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRMOUTHER'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY
6267-53049-0031 DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS CHANGED IN THE TWINED FLING OF AN EYE
6267-53049-0032 WHEN MISSUS FARWEATHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
6267-65525-0000 AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW HER
6267-65525-0001 AUNT JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH HER LAMP IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BABY CLANGING TO THE OTHER
6267-65525-0002 SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND VULGAR AS A SUNFLOWER WAS AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND ACTIONS
6267-65525-0003 I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISTER BIGGSBY IS THIS EVENING SIDDY AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK
6267-65525-0004 SYDNEY SIGHED AND WENT DOWN STEPS FOR THE BABY
6267-65525-0005 ALL HER DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM JOYFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
6267-65525-0006 BUT SHE DID REALLY RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER
6267-65525-0007 THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SYDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMART COUSINS
6267-65525-0008 HER BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL HER AVAILABLE SPACE
6267-65525-0009 JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A PIN AND THE MOUTH ZIGZAGGED FROM EAR TO EAR
6267-65525-0010 SYDNEY HATED THAT MIRROR AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE DID HATE ANYTHING
6267-65525-0011 HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SYDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THE DOUBLE FUNERAL HAVE BEEN PAID
6267-65525-0012 PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO WATCH WITH A FLUSH OF REAL EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE
6267-65525-0013 ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO ELLEN DOUGLAS AND THAT WAS FORWARDED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFFERING EDITOR OF THE MAPLELE LEAF
6267-65525-0014 HE WROTE THAT ALTHOUGH HIS AGE LABORED HIM FROM MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB HE WAS TWENTY AND THE LIMIT WAS EIGHTEEN HE READ THE LETTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH MUCH INTEREST AND OFTEN HAD THOUGHT OF ANSWERING SOME OF THE REQUESTS FOR CORRESPONDENCE
6267-65525-0015 IT NEVER HAD DONE SO BUT ELLEN DOUGLAS'S LETTER WAS SO INTERESTING THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO WRITE TO HER
6267-65525-0016 WOULD SHE BE KING ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND WITH HIM
6267-65525-0017 HE WAS TWO YEARS OUT FROM THE EAST AND HAD NOT YET RETURNED TO BE HOMESICK AT TIMES
6267-65525-0018 SYDNEY WATCHED THE LETTER AND ANSWERED IT
6267-65525-0019 BUT SHE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET JOHN LINCOLN NOR DID SHE WISH TO DO SO
6267-65525-0020 IN THE CORRESPONDENCE ITSELF SHE FOUND HER PLEASANT
6267-65525-0021 JOHN LINCOLN WROTE BREEZY ACCOUNTS OF RANCH LIFE AND ADVENTURES ON THE FAR WESTERN PLAINS SO ALIEN AND REMOTE FROM SNUG HUMDRUM PLAINFIELD LIFE THAT SYDNEY ALWAYS HAD THE SENSATION OF CROSSING A GULF WHEN SHE OPENED A LETTER FROM THE BAR AND AS FOR SYDNEY'S OWN LETTER THIS IS THE WAY IT READ AS SHE WROTE IT
6267-65525-0022 THE EVERGREENS ON PLAINFIELD DEAR MISTER LINCOLN
6267-65525-0023 I LOVE LIFE AND ITS BLOOM AND ITS BRILLIANCY I LOVE MEETING NEW PEOPLE I LOVE THE RIPPLE OF MUSIC THE HUM OF LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION
6267-65525-0024 THE MAN I HAD BEEN TALKING WITH WAS PAUL MOORE THE GREAT NATURALIST
6267-65525-0025 AS IT WAS I HAD CONTRADICTED HIM TWICE AND HE HAD LAUGHED AND LIKED IT BUT HIS BOOKS WOULD ALWAYS HAVE A NEW MEANING TO ME HENCEFORTH THROUGH THE INSIGHT HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN ME
6267-65525-0026 IT IS SUCH WRITINGS AS THESE THAT GIVE LIFE ITS SPARKLE FOR ME
6267-65525-0027 YOU'LL BE WEARY OF MY RHAPSODIES OVER HERE

6467-97061-0013 I AM AN APSYRAS BORN FROM THE RAYS OF THE MOON
6467-97061-0014 ONE DAY AS I WAS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR WEARING A WHITE DRESS A SWAN MISTAKING ME FOR A LOTUS FLOWER ATTACKED ME AND
6467-97061-0015 IN HIS ANGER HE CURSED ME SAYING O WICKED ONE FOR THIS OFFENSE YOU ARE CONDEMNED TO BE CHANGED INTO A PIECE OF FALSE METAL
6467-97061-0016 THE CHANGE TOOK PLACE IMMEDIATELY AND I FELL UPON THE GROUND TURNED INTO A SILVER CHAIN
6467-97061-0017 ON HIS WAY HE SAW THE SILVER FETTLE DESCENDED TO THE GROUND PICKED IT UP AND CONTINUED HIS FALL
6467-97061-0018 THE SLAYER OF GENDRAVAMBA HEARING THIS CAME OUT OF THE PALACE AND QUICKLY MOUNTING THE ELEPHANT WHO HELD DOWN HIS TRUNK TO RECEIVE HIM PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE PRINCE
6467-97061-0019 GREAT WAS THEIR MUTUAL ASTONISHMENT AND JOY WHEN THEY RECOGNISED EACH OTHER THE PRINCE EXCLAIMING IS HE POSSIBLE
6467-97061-0020 IS IT REALLY YOU MY DEAR FRIEND APOHARA ALMAH WHO HAVE DONE THIS DEED
6467-97061-0021 THROUGH THESE THEY FORCED THEIR WAY EMPLOYING WITH GOOD EFFECTS THE WEAPONS PLACED ON THE ELEPHANT FOR THE USE OF GENDRA RAMAN
6467-97061-0022 BEFORE HOWEVER THEY HAD GONE FAR THEY HEARD THE NOISE OF BATTLE AT A DISTANCE AND SAW THE SOLDIER IN FRONT OF THEM SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS
6467-97061-0023 WE HAVE JUST NOW ENCOUNTERED AND UTTERLY DEFEATED THE ENEMIES SO THAT THERE IS NO FEAR OF ANY FURTHER RESISTANCE
6467-97061-0024 RAJALMANHA AGREED TO THIS
6599-38590-0000 WHATEVER HAND IT WAS THAT SHOT DOWN BOURBON ROME AFTER HIS DEATH WAS PLUNDERED DEVASTATED AND RAVAGED WITH A BRUTAL GREEDY LICENTIOUS AND FANATICAL SOLDIERY

6599-38590-0006 GIVE IT ME OR RETURN AS THOU IST COME
6599-38590-0007 I AM QUITE WILLING SAID THE KING LET HIM HAVE YOU
6599-38590-0008 THE PIECE OF CAMBREY WAS CALLED THE LADY'S PIECE IN HONOUR OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO HAD NEGOTIATED IT THOUGH MORALLY DIFFERENT AND OF VERY UNEQUAL WORTH THEY BOTH HAD MINDS OF A RARE ORDER AND TRAINED TO RECOGNISE POLITICAL NECESSARIES AND NOT TO ATTEMPT ANY BUT POSSIBLE SUCCESSES
6599-38590-0009 ALL THE GREAT POLITICAL ACTORS APPEARED HURRYING AWAY FROM THE STAGE AS IF THE DRAMA WERE APPROACHING ITS END
6599-38591-0000 IN FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO AT THE BATTLE OF DRULL HE WAS AGED AND SO ILL THAT NONE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM ON HORSEBACK
6599-38591-0001 HE FULLY ARMED SAVE ONLY HIS HEAD ANSWERED HIM RIGHT WELL SIR THIS IS THE REAL MEDICINE THAT HATH CURED ME FOR THE BATTLE WHICH IS TOWARD AND A PREPARING FOR THE HONOUR OF GOD AND OUR CAMP
6599-38591-0002 THE LADY'S PEACE CONCLUDED AT CAMBRAI IN FIFTEEN TWENTY NINE LASTED UP TO FIFTEEN THIRTY SIX INCESSANTLY TROUBLED HOWEVER BY FAR FROM PACIFIC SENTIMENTS PROCEEDINGS AND PREPARATIONS
6599-38591-0003 AT LAST HE DECIDED UPON ENTREATING
6599-38591-0004 IT WAS GARSILLASO DE LA VEGA THE PRINCE OF SPANISH POESY THE SPANISH PATARCH ACCORDING TO HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN
6599-38591-0005 MONTMORENCY SIGNED A SIMILAR ONE FOR PIEDRO
6599-38591-0006 THEY ALL REPAIRED TOGETHER TO THE HOUSE PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND AFTER DINNER THE EMPEROR BEING TIRED LAY DOWN TO REST ON A COUCH QUEEN ELLINOR BEFORE LONG WENT AND TAPPED AT HIS DOOR AND SENT WORD TO THE KING THAT THE EMPEROR WAS AWAKE
6599-38591-0007 FRANCES WITH THE CARDINAL DE LORRAINE AND THE CONSTABLE OF MONTMORENCY SOON ARRIVED
6599-38591-0008 ON ENTERING THE CHAMBER HE FOUND THE EMPEROR STILL LYING DOWN AND CHATTING WITH HIS SISTER THE QUEEN WHO WAS SEATED BESIDE HIM ON HIS CHAIR
6599-38591-0009 YES SAID CHARLES I HAD MADE SUCH CHEER THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO HELP IT OFF
6599-38591-0010 FRANCIS HAD THE CONVERSE WITH HIS OWN COLLAR
6599-38591-0011 ONLY SEVEN OF HIS ATTENDANTS REMAINED IN THE EMPEROR'S CHAMBER AND THERE THE TWO SOVEREIGNS CONVERSED FOR AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THEY MOVED TO THE HALL WHERE A SPLENDID SUPPER AWAITED THEM
6599-38591-0012 THE GENTES PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE ATTACKED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE OR RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ACCESSION
6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF THE HABIT AND DROPPED BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON'S SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALL THE DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRALS
6841-88291-0002 SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S WOWL BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE RAMOUDO FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDON CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE COWS WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO GIVE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE SALT GRASS
6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO WOULD GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANCE
6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASEWOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILDING A FIRE IN THE FENCE
6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIDE GATE ENTERED
6841-88291-0008 I STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J H STAMPING IRONS IN HIS HAND
6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE FENCE SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTING TOGETHER AGAIN
6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUNLIGHT SLANTED ACROSS IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODER AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARDD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
6841-88291-0013 HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SET OVER HIM ONE STRIP TO AVOID THE TIGHTENED LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF BUT
6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE BEFORE THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULL DOGGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCE UPON THE VICTORY
6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLUPPED OUT ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
6841-88291-0018 THUS THE CALIF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY SHARP
6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULL DOGRS
6841-88291-0021 MARKY YELLED THE OTHER
6841-88291-0022 THE BREATHER PRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF BLAIDING A LITTLE LEST THE HEAT SCORCHED
6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOW CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOR TO INDICATE DEW PEELING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
6841-88291-0025 BUT HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOW TAIL ON THE OTHER
6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF GRANDON
6841-88291-0027 UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT NATURAL AND COULD SOME OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADOPT IT IN PREFERENCE
6841-88291-0028 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THE SPREAD OF THIS DOCTRINE THOUGH ARIZONA
6841-88291-0029 IMAGINE A PUNCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TAGS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR IN A ROUNDHOUSE
6841-88291-0030 A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEEDING OR TO GETTING IDLY ABOUT
6841-88291-0031 BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFE TIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORTER TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD OUR TEETH FILLED
6841-88291-0032 ONE OF THE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS BUT A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEGS BUT TOSSED HIS LOOP OVER ITS KNEES
6841-88291-0033 MISTER FROST'S BULL CALF ALONE IN PICTORIAL HISTORY SHOWS THE ATTITUDE OF
6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS A GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THE FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERPUTABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER
6841-88291-0035 AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND FELL
6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD CATCH HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE VIGOROUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING BACK FOR THE UPRIGHT
6841-88291-0037 YOU CAN IMAGINE WHICH HAPPENED NEXT
6841-88291-0038 THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME FUN IF IT ALLOWS
6841-88291-0039 BY NOW THE BRANDES WAS IN FULL SWING
6841-88291-0040 WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID THE CASTAL
6841-88291-0041 MEN RAN TO AND FRO BUSYING AND INTENT
6841-88291-0042 SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR CALVES WERE ON THAT GROUND AT ONCE
6841-88291-0043 DUSTERED AND DISSIPATED
6841-88291-0044 NO MORE NICK CALVS THEY ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0045 THEN HE WOULD SPIT OUT HIS HANDS AND GO AT IT ALONE
6841-88291-0046 IF LUCK ATTENDED HIS NEXT EFFORT HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND THERE'S YOUR LITTLE CALF SAID HE
6841-88291-0047 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THIS FAR WITH YOUR LITTLE FLOAT IRON
6841-88291-0048 TOWARD NOON THE SLACKED
6841-88291-0049 FINALLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMAN AND REPORTED THE BRANDEN FINISHED
6841-88291-0050 THE LATTER COUNTED THE MARKS IN MY TALLY BOOK
6841-88291-0051 ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIXTY SIX HE ANNOUNCED
6841-88291-0052 THE MARKERS SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS HOLD OVER THE BITS OF EARS THEY HAD SAVED
6841-88291-0053 THE TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT AN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
6841-88291-0054 FINALLY WINN DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HIP POCKET
6841-88291-0055 THEY HAD BEEN DOING A WRESTLER'S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNING FOR DID NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED
6841-88291-0056 I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN'S AND THAT IT'D EXERCISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF THE BODY
6841-88294-0000 AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THE STORM UPON THE ROOFS CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EAVES
6841-88294-0001 WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKING OUT AT A PARLOR GAME I SAW THEM ALL
6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEEL THROUGH CLIFF AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN MY LEFT LEG
6841-88294-0003 WHEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD CUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND
6841-88294-0004 IN PLACE OF IT HE WORE A SOFT STEEL HOOK
6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHIN HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DID N'T SOUND GOOD
6841-88294-0006 WHEN A MAN BREATHES THAT WAY HE'S MOSTLY OFF GONE
6841-88294-0007 MEN GO BATTED OVER THE HEAD OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
6841-88294-0008 SOUR WINE IS FINE TO PUT A WORM IN SHAPE TO HEEL BUT IT'S NO SOOTHIN SYRUP
6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRAVE THAT WAS THE SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEA DONE ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBAREE
6841-88294-0010 IT FAIR MADE MY HEAD RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH THE BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE AND THE QUIET MOONLIGHT IN THE SHADOWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZONING EACH SIDE HIS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER THE RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I HAD MADE OUT TO GET HIM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AND PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP
6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN HE'D SING THAT BARBARY SONG TILL I'D GO OUT AN LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWIN BY JIST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DIED AND GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE'D JUST TALK
6841-88294-0013 HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND HE GAVE HIS SIDE OF CONVERSATION AS PAUSING FOR REPLIES
6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THE HOUR BUT I NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE'D COME FROM OR WHAT HE'S DONE
6841-88294-0015 I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO EM BUT HE WAS QUIET
6841-88294-0016 USUALLY I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING ABOUT SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
6841-88294-0017 HE WAS LAIN ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES HE ASKED VERY STERN
6841-88294-0019 YOU ONE LITTLE SQUEEZE TALK ABOUT YOUR DEADLY WEAPONS
6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'D BEEN TOO SICK AND TOO LONG AN BED
6841-88294-0021 IN A MINUTE OR SO HE CAME TO US
6841-88294-0022 NOW YOU'RE A NICE SWEET PROPOSITION SAID HE AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
6841-88294-0023 THEY'RE SAFE ENOUGH LET ME HAVE THEM HE BOWED
6841-88294-0024 NOW LOOK HERE SAID I YOU CAN'T GET UP TO DAY YOU AIN'T FAT
6841-88294-0025 I KNOW HE PLEASED BUT LET ME SEE THEM
6841-88294-0026 JUST TO SATISFY HIMSELF I PASSED OVER HIS OLD DUDS
6841-88294-0027 I'VE BEEN ROBBED SHE CRIES
6841-88294-0028 WHERE'D MY COAT HE ASKED
6841-88294-0029 WE HAD NO COAT WHEN I PICKED YOU UP I REPLIED
6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED AT ME MIGHTY SUSPICION BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
6841-88294-0031 AFTER HE'D EATEN A BLACK MEAL HE FELL ASLEEP
6841-88294-0032 WHEN I CAME UP THAT EVENING THE BUNK WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE
6841-88294-0033 I DIDN'T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS
6841-88294-0034 THEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM JUST A WAYS OFF
6841-88294-0035 GUESS HE'S SUSPICIOUS I'VE STOLE THAT OLD COAT OF HIS THINKS I AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT
6841-88294-0036 HOWEVER HE DIDN'T STAY LONG IN HIS FRAME OF MIND
6841-88294-0037 I RAN UP PULLING HIS GUN
6841-88294-0038 MEX WAS FLAT ON HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHING OUT
6841-88294-0039 ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK HELD MY ONE ARMED FRIEND
6841-88294-0040 ANYWAY I THRUST THE MUZZLE OF MY COLTS INTO A SAILOR'S FACE WHAT'S THIS I ASKED
6841-88294-0041 I WEEN HIM ET MONTE OF ANTONIO CURVAZ SAID
6841-88294-0042 THE GLEAM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SNARLS LIFTED HIS LIPS
6841-88294-0043 IN ANY CASE HE THREW POCO PRONTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
6841-88294-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS HE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOSTLY DOIN ODD JOBS I SAW HIM OFF AN ON
6841-88294-0045 HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THAT TIME ALMIGHTY BUSY HOLDING DOWN MY CARD GAME
6841-88294-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I FOR YOU'D BETTER STAY RIGHT THERE
6841-88294-0047 I WANT TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE ANSWERED HE
6841-88294-0048 WHAT KIND OF THE GOOD THING I ASKED TREASURE SAID HE

6841-88294-0053 IT WILL MAKE US RICH FOR A DOZEN LIKE US AND YOU CAN KISS THE BOOK ON THAT
6841-88294-0054 THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT WHY DO YOU TAKE ME
6841-88294-0055 WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR TREASURE WITHOUT ANY NEED OF DIVIDING IT
6841-88294-0056 WHYMATE HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAIN GRATITUDE
6841-88294-0057 DIDN'T YOU SAVE YOUR LIFE AND NUSS ME AND TAKE CARE OF ME WHEN I WAS NOT KILLED
6841-88294-0058 LOOK HERE ANDERSON OR HANDY SOLOMON OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO CALL YOURSELF I REJOINED TO THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU'LL HAVE TO WALK STRAIGHT
6841-88294-0059 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY GRATITUDE BUT THAT DON'T COME WITH ME
6841-88294-0060 THAT DEVIL'S A PREACHER IF YOU AIN'T LOST YOUR PEN FEATHERS SAID HE
6841-88294-0061 WELL IT'S THIS THEN I GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GET IT THERE AND SHE MUST BE STOCKED
6841-88294-0062 AND I GOT TO HAVE HELP WITH THE TREASURE IF IT'S LIKE THIS FELLER SAID IT WAS
6841-88294-0063 IT'S MONEY I'VE GOT TO HAVE AND IT'S MONEY I HAVEN'T GOT AND CAN'T GET UNLESS I LETS SOMEBODY IN AS PAR'NER
6841-88294-0064 WHY NOW I ASKED WHY NOT HE RETORTED
6841-88294-0065 WE HAD TALKED THE MATTER OVER AT LENGTH
6841-88294-0066 I STOOD OUT FOR A LARGER BODY
6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS AS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT A HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY WE COMPROMISED
6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THEIR TREASURE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SCHEME DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
700-122866-0000 BUT JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE AGAIN
700-122866-0001 PERHAPS PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLE FOR EVERY DAY LIFE
700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARILLA DISAPPROVES OF HER
700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE SENSIBLE IF
700-122866-0004 I JUST LAY AWAKE AND I IMAGINE THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER THIS AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTS
700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAMME AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE I HAD TO DO PROPERLY
700-122866-0007 THE WINTER WEEKS SLIP OVER
700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THE CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON WRITE A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WORK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT
700-122866-0009 I CAN SCARCELY REALIZE THAT I'RE IN MY TEENS
700-122866-0010 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO KNOW THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT
700-122866-0011 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BEAUCS SAID ANNE DISDAINFULLY
700-122866-0012 SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ANY ONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN A TAKE NOTICES FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
700-122866-0013 I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLISON AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE'S PERFECT
700-122866-0014 IF I HAD ALICE BELL'S CROOKED NOSE SAID ANNE DETERMINEDLY I WOULDN'T BUT THERE
700-122866-0015 I'M AFRAID I' THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMPLEMENT ABOUT IT LONG AGO
700-122866-0016 YES DIANA LOOK THERE'S A RABBIT
700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING POOR DREAMS
700-122866-0018 SHE WROTE IT LAST MONDAY EVENING
700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR IN DEATH NOT DIVIDED IT
700-122866-0020 I READ IT TO MARILLA AND THEN SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF AND NONSENSE
700-122866-0021 IT'S A SAFE SWEET STORY
700-122866-0022 CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORNET OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DUSKLY FLASHING EYE
700-122866-0023 YOU SAY SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE
700-122866-0024 THEY GREW IN BEAUTY AS SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE SIXTEEN
700-122866-0025 I ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY TO BE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED
700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FRIEND IN THE SAME AS EVER
700-122866-0027 LET'S YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CLUB ALL OUR OWN AND WRITE STORIES IN PRACTICE
700-122866-0028 YOU OUGHT TO CULTIVATE THEIR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS STACY SAYS SO
700-122866-0029 ON WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT WAY
700-122866-0030 THIS WAS HOW THE STORY HAD CAME INTO EXISTENCE
700-122866-0031 NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MOTHER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK
700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO READ HER STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN WE TALK IT OUT
700-122866-0033 MINE IS ROSAMONDE MONTMORESYRE ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
700-122866-0034 I'M SURE THAT MUST HAVE A WHOLESOME OBJECT
700-122866-0035 THE MORAL WAS THE GREAT THING MISTER ALLEN SAYS SO
700-122866-0036 I READ ONE OF MY STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLEN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MORNING WAS EXCELLENT
700-122866-0037 JANE AND RUBY ALMOST ALWAYS CRY WHEN I TURN TO THE PATHETIC PARTS
700-122866-0038 AND MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE
700-122866-0039 I'RE SURE MISSUS ALLEN WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE
700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I FOUND THAT
700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE ALWAYS FELT SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANY ONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THERE WERE
700-122866-0042 NOW I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED THAT WAY
700-122867-0000 IN VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT
700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND MARILLA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEPS WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL GLADNESS
700-122867-0002 I MUST SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT NOR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW
700-122867-0003 PERHAPS YOU'RE JUDGING HER TOO HASTILY MARY
700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HER PART MATTHEWS BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU
700-122867-0005 DEMANDED MARILLA ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO THE BEDROOM
700-122867-0006 ANNEN COWERED DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOR EVER FROM MORTAL EYES NO
700-122867-0007 GET RIGHT UP THIS MINUTE AND TELL YE
700-122867-0008 THIS MINUTE I SAY THERE NOW WHY IS IT
700-122867-0009 ANNE HAD SLID TO THE WALL IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE
700-122867-0010 AH YES IT'S GREEN MOANED ANNE
700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS THEIR RED HAIR
700-122867-0012 YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR IT TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
700-122867-0013 NO THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR
700-122867-0014 MAN SHIRLEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO
700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED HANS
700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DADDED
700-122867-0017 AND MISSUS ALLISON SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANY ONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT
700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T THEN AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY I
700-122867-0019 WHO SAID WHO ARE YOU TALKING OF
700-122867-0020 NOW I DIDN'T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE
700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH THEIR BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE
700-122867-0022 OH PRISCILLA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTISED TO DECEIVE
700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO DOWN WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
700-122867-0024 WITH A DISMAL SIGH SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSOR
700-122867-0025 BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT A DIRTY COLOR IS THERE
700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO WEEP ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF I WON'T INTERFERE
700-122867-0027 IT APPEARED SUCH A TRAGIC THING
700-122867-0028 ANNE WEPT THEN AND LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UP STAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
700-122867-0029 AH YES I WILL TOO
700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURING
700-122867-0031 I EXPECT SOMETHING WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MY NOSE NEXT
700-122867-0032 ANN'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION AT SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCARE SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I DID N'T
700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOES N'T IT
700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS AND I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE MISERABLE AGAIN
700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE BUT
700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLAN AND MISS STACEY AND GROW UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU
700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON ON MY HEAD WITH A BOW AT ONE SIDE
700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL IT A SNOOD THAT IT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
700-122867-0040 MY HEAD IS BETTER NO
700-122867-0041 IT WAS TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON NO
700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE DAN SAID DIANA
700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW NOW THAT I COULDN'T KEEP STILL
700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A RED HEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNA
700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS A LILY LADY
700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU SET IT
700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY THAT BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANN'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATIZE ARAINE
700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WE WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT
700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING A CLEAN
700-122868-0009 THE BLACK SHELL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPED IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND ARMS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS THE HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
700-122868-0011 MADAME YOU ARRANGES
700-122868-0012 IT'S LOVELY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE'S DEAD
700-122868-0013 JANE ROSE AT THE OCCASION
700-122868-0014 AND LEFT BEHIND AT THE LANDING
700-122868-0015 ANNE GIVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
700-122868-0016 THERE IS ONLY CHANCE JUST ONE
700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWERY PRAYERS
700-122868-0018 THE FLAT DRIFTED UNDER THE BRIDGES AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MID STREAM
700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NO DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD COME DOWN WITH IT
700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY A SEEMING LIKE AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILYMAN
700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS BEEN
700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GLEESOME POSSIBILITIES TO HER
700-122868-0023 AND SHIRNEY
700-122868-0024 WHAT ON EARTH DID YOU GET UP THERE HE EXCLAIMED
700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE GAINED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
700-122868-0026 OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED ANNE
700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERTE TAKING UP HIS OARS
700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT AND THE BARGE I MEAN THE FO
700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT ANNE HESITATED THEN
700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK GREAT LITTLE BEAT
700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS THEN NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND THAT I DON'T WANT TO BE
700-122868-0033 ALL RIGHT'
700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN TOM SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL IN
700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIEND INTO A SCRAPE
700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO GO
700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANN GROANED MARILLA
700-122868-0039 I I DON'T SAY HOW SAID MARILLA
700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF HIS GREAT SHORTCOMING
7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT THAT IS DYING OF PAIN
7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IPSOPHYLICITIS SE NISCITEMPERAT PREMITE EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND TO CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE IS SOME PICTURE OF PLEASURE
7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND HE WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS BUT THE SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS
7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIVES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR A GREATER WEIGHT
7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLES AND SENT THEM TO EXHIBIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAIN WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE
7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE ILLS OF A LONG PEACE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WARS
7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF COTTON YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PAY
7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSE TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTERS OF YOUNG MEN WHAT PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE OFFERS DELAYED FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
7601-101622-0005 LET BEAST'S BLOOD STAIN THE INFAMOUS ARENA AND THEN NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND TO DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO INSOMUCH AS THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR DEATH
7601-101622-0007 THE VERY WORDS THEMSELVES SET THEM ON
7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING OF REVOLT HE
7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARD THE FOREWARD
7601-175351-0002 LIGHT THE FIRES EXCLAIMED A
7601-175351-0003 WHAT WITH ASKS OTHERS
7601-175351-0004 AND YOU STUFF THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED WARREN
7601-175351-0005 DID YOU HEARD ME
7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE CRIED HATTERIS
7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PENN ADVANCING TOWARDS THE DOCTOR
7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED PENN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND YOU WON'T GO ANY FURTHER
7601-175351-0009 YOU SHA'N'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEN THEY SHA'N'T LIGHT THE FIRES
7601-175351-0010 IF I REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN AND GUARDED
7601-175351-0011 A MURMUR WAS HEARD NOW
7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY A PLOVER AND WARREN WENT DOWN TO HIS POST
7601-175351-0013 THAT STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERED AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROW
7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BEHRING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWDING TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERRATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
7601-175351-0015 I'M BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WALLOW
7601-175351-0016 HATTERAS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL AS SAINT EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS AS APOCRYPHATE
7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH TWENTY FIVE HOURS IN THEM
7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK FELT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK BRAVING COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
7601-175351-0021 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO IMITATE THEM I SEE
7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAWBONNY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND THEY ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED BUT
7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WILL MISTER COLBONNY
7601-175351-0025 I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAD TWO
7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FOREWORD WAS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRENELL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITANNIA THE MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCYDIDES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THIS HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HINTS WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE A FAVOURITE THAT THIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE TRUE SUBJECTS FOR THAT HISTORIC PEN
7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TEMPLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE FINALLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES
7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES OF WHICH HE HAD MADE CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AND APOTHEGMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SPOLIA OPTIMA
7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOTS INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATUS
7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHERCOCKS THAT WENT AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONG HEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIVES IN QUEST OF TREASURES ON THE BOTTOM
7641-96252-0000 THUS WHEN DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS JUST THE SAME
7641-96252-0001 AND THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MORE MODIFIED THROUGH DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
7641-96252-0003 WITH A EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE WHEEL AND ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN THE LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS FASHION
7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BELONGS TO A FLEETING AND ELUSIVE PHILOSOPHY
7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY OFTEN IN THE SUFFERER
7641-96252-0008 BUT THE LATTER IS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE SYMPTOM IN THAT KNOWLEDGE
7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITE OF THE STAIN OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AT EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN A WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY TO WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOSS OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL ONE YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SERENITY OF DISPOSITION
7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON THE ONE
7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALISE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNES
7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO AUGHT BUT LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS WE CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERRING THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF SUCH INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTWEIGH THE REGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SOCRATES AND GIORDANO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THIS TRUTH SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HAND OF THE PRIESTS
7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES A SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE
7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPACITY FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON EXAMINATION
7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS I
7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMED TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHERE AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISH FOR DELIVERANCE
7641-96670-0000 THEY WAS IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SESASTRAS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF AJA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN HER RISING AND SETTING
7641-96670-0002 MEDIA TOO HIS WISER DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF KRETHEUS AND CREPTHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMIS THEIR GRANDFATHER
7641-96670-0004 JASON TAKE PELIAS AND TELAMON WITH HIM
7641-96670-0005 AS THEY CAME IN THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHRIXUS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
7641-96670-0006 THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PALACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THAT MORNING
7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KENNAEUS LIVED WITH OBSYRTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDEA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS
7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDIE SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FACISUS
7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF THE GREECE
7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SARMATI
7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR THEM
7641-96670-0013 ADARE'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
7641-96670-0014 AND AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID
7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL THAT HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YOU ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF A MORTALS
7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL HAVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU
7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE TALKING WITH HIM
7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN GOLD HAIR
7641-96670-0020 KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF EERIS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS
7641-96670-0021 THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH LIKE A DRAGON
7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT IT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE
7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF A BRAVE
7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE
7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS AID AS IT IS
7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAYS THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDIA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
7641-96670-0027 PHRONTIS AND MOLLUS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
7641-96684-0000 AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONG THE MEN
7641-96684-0001 AND AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING
7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THEIR QUEST
7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER ADMEINUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS SAW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS LIKE JOY
7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID I ADMETUS
7641-96684-0007 BUT THIS APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADEMETUS
7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NEVER MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS AD MEDIUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
7641-96684-0011 IF ANY WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS
7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN STONES
7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS STANDING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR
7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THAT PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH
7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE STRANGE WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
7641-96684-0016 ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOW TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
7641-96684-0017 THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THAT PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU HAVE THE KEEN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
7641-96684-0019 NOW THE FOOT SEEMED TO STOP
7641-96684-0020 IT WERE NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
7641-96684-0021 ON THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR EVER
7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR YO WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE
7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM HIS PALACE
7641-96684-0025 NO MORE SPEECH CAME THROUGH HER
7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BY THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DOING
7641-96684-0028 AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOUR WAS BEFORE HER
7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHO DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH HEALTH
7641-96684-0031 IN WHAT A NOBLE THEME IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
7641-96684-0032 SHE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
7641-96684-0033 YOU WERE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE FOUND PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM
7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS A VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
7641-96684-0036 HERE'S A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY
7641-96684-0037 THAT I CAN NOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PAINS ENOUGH
7641-96684-0038 THEN ADMETUS RAISE THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THAT HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I AM COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT GUION
7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THIS MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG HIS HEAD
7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES SHE MEAN
7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO THE LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MEN TO SWEEP IT
7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THOSE
7697-105815-0008 THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COMING IN TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAY IT LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAUCHE HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST RACED FROM THY SINS
7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CROSS BLESSED STONE
7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE WE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SISTERS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO WE GO
7697-105815-0014 FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT DJAIN FOR PRAISE
7697-105815-0015 KNOW YE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS THE THIEF
7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE OF THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF YOU
7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE'RE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE GUARDS
7697-105815-0019 IS NOT OUR CASE AS MUCH AS YOURS
7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THIS HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT OFF THE HILL
7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO WENT BY MIGHT REST THERE
7697-105815-0023 TIMARU SAID THAT ZAYING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE KNEW THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS
7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE WOMAN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
7697-105815-0026 HE FELT FOR IT BUT FIND IT NOT
7697-105815-0027 SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS FLOCK
7697-105815-0028 OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHIME HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS FLEET
7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR MUST I HAVE BEEN IN MY WAY BY THIS TIME
7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST HIS SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK
7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HATH GOT BACK HIS SCROW
7697-105815-0033 HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANK TO GOD
7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAMB THE HEELS
7697-105815-0035 HALF THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRINGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HAUL AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS MY STRENGTH SO SMALL
7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NOTHING
7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH THAT NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
7697-105815-0039 AND I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE A WATCHFUL DWELT
7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHICH HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT
7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS HER NAME
7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH THEM TO THE HOUSE
7697-105815-0043 HAIDEE COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK OF ME
7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MONTTHIAR
7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE A LORD
7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I SAY
7697-105815-0048 CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING US WITH YOU
7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE HER
7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAMES OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN
7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAIN AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH
7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIANA
7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANUOS LAND
7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORDS WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
7697-105817-0001 JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HADT TO SAY
7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THIS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRIN IN OUR TOWN
7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH FORTUNE
7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID CHRISTIANS LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SET OFF FROM THE FIELDS
7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FATHER I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE FOR NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD
7697-105817-0008 CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO DRAW BACK
7697-105817-0009 THEN SAID DRYING DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE
7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS I KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FORD
7697-105817-0011 AND BY THIS ACT WE CURE ALL SOULS AS WELL
7697-245712-0000 BEFORE WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THEIR ANIMALS
7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPY NOTHING DISBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
7697-245712-0003 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH ALWAYS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPREME
7697-245712-0004 THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OF OTHER ANIMALS
7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PATENT IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO A MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THE
7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NAMES
7697-245712-0009 SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT END OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT IN THE SAFE INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS FEARFUL WOULD HE HAVE ABATE MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE
7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEANIONS OVER PLANS
7697-245712-0013 NOW EMIN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF THE OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNI HAVE BEEN STERILE
7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BUSINESS DISPARITY
7697-245712-0016 INEQUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE IN THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE
7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF SCIENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN
7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO EVERY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER
7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE CONSISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS
7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF WHOLE AGE
7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED WAS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY A GENERATION
7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT OF BODILY SIZE AND POWER
7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT THEY SAID
8173-294714-0001 AND THEN I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS
8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN SHE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
8173-294714-0003 HIS REAL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENCE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I ANSWERED BITTERLY
8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN MAY INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH THEN STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE ASK
8173-294714-0008 YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW HOW MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL YOURS
8173-294714-0009 WHAT WRONGER ARE YOU TALKING OF
8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING SO
8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT IS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS A CHILD
8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND DAUGHTER I SAID
8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD PRIDE SHE INTERRUPTED
8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MINE I
8173-294714-0016 A HELPLESS GIRL WITH A MOCK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0017 WAS I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD AND SHELTER
8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF OUR CHILD
8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED OFF
8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THOUGHT ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THAT WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS HIS STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
8173-294714-0023 YES WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YE SPEAK OF IT
8173-294714-0025 THIS I YIELDED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD THAT SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS IF I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION
8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT BUT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
8173-294714-0029 O LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN
8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO BE YOUR ONLY THING
8173-294714-0031 THAT YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE SAID GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH
8173-294714-0033 MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEAR YET
8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED IT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN BUT MISTER VAN BRANDT
8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF HIM NOW MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
8173-294714-0037 WHY NEED YOU HESITATE
8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I CAN NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETIES
8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL TO YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH
8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS TAKING OUT OF PRISON
8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT APART FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURN TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR ME WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS
8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE IS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRIT A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF OUR POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS A MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD GIVE IT

8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE IT
8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT WERE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE

8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY YOUR GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERS ME AND
8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN A HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
8254-115543-0001 EVERY THING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF EXTRAORDINARY ORDERS
8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE CORRECTING AND SCOLDING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON
8254-115543-0003 THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION BUT AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY
8254-115543-0004 BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER AND HER DULY DECK A SORT OF A LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SOWN BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES
8254-115543-0005 BESIDES THIS FAMILY THERE WERE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THE SLOW MOVING WAGON
8254-115543-0006 THE COOK NOW WENT WITH THEM
8254-115543-0007 GOOD BYE SHOUTED LITTLE KNALL FROM HIS GARDEN WHILES THEY WENT BY GOOD BYE
8254-115543-0008 THEY SHOUTED GREETINGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE POTTER AS THEY PASSED HIM AND ALSO TO THE OLD FAKIR SMEARED ALL OVER WITH ASHES WHO SAT IN A LITTLE BRICK HUT BY THE BRIDGE AND PRETENDED TO GIVE WONDERFUL CURES
8254-115543-0009 THIS IS MORE FUN THAN GOING TO SCHOOL SAID COLA AS THE OXEN PLODDED ON THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
8254-115543-0010 THESE LOVELY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS RUN QUITE LARGE
8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS FINGERS
8254-115543-0012 AS THE WAGON CAME UP A YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THE HOLY MAN RAN UP AND HELD OUT A BEGGING BOWL SAYING GIVE O CHARITABLE PEOPLE TO THAT HOLY ONE
8254-115543-0013 NO COUNTRY ON THE WORLD HAS SO MANY BEGGARS AS INDIA
8254-115543-0014 MANY OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO HIM
8254-115543-0015 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEAR US
8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THEY HAD DOGS SAID MAHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CANE DOWN BY THE STREAM
8254-115543-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN BUY SOME FROM THE MAN THERE HE IS NOW PLOWING BY THE STREAMS SAID COLLA
8254-115543-0018 IT IS LOOKING FOR WATER SAID THE FARMER AS HE TOOK A LAST STOCK OF CAENE AND GENTLY GUIDED IT DOWN TO THE STREAM
8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS ANOTHER SACRED ANIMAL OF THE HINDOOS AND WE WOULD NOT KILL OR INJURE ONE FOR ANYTHING
8254-115543-0020 WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD
8254-115543-0021 IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING IN STATE ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJA OR RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MODERN INDIA HAD FORMERLY MADE UP
8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT ALL DECORATED WITH MILK AND GOLD AND SILVER
8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS THE HOWOUDAH WHICH WAS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS THE RAJA A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLORED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN
8254-115543-0024 BEHIND THE HOWDAH STOOD A SERPENT HOLDING A BIG UMBRELLA OF FINE FEATHERS OVER THE RAJAH'S HEAD
8254-115543-0025 THE DRIVER SAT UP ON THE NECK OF THE ELEPHANT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST BY PRODDING HIM ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN IRON SHOD STICK OR GOAD
8254-115543-0026 ISN'T IT FINE TO RISE LIKE THAT ON A BIG ELEPHANT
8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF THE DAY THE LITTLE FOLK TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE GREAT RAJAS AND HIS ESCORT
8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THE SUPPERS OR BARGAINING FOR FOOD AT THE LITTLE BOOTH
8254-115543-0029 THESE THEY USED FOR PLATES HEAPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICE AND CURRY AND FISH AND ALL SORTS OF PUTTINGS AND SWEETS
8254-115543-0030 A SUPPER WAS BEEN EATEN ANOTHER PARTY STOPPED AT THE PARRAL ENCAMPED NOT FAR AWAY
8254-115543-0031 AS THE LITTER WAS PUT DOWN A YOUNG BOY STEPPED OUT LOOKING VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY
8254-115543-0032 HIS FRIENDS AT ONCE SPREAD A HANDSOME RUG ON THE GROUND FOR HIM TO SIT ON AND RUSHED ABOUT WAITING ON HIM TAKING GOOD CARE TO KEEP EVERYONE AT A DISTANCE
8254-115543-0033 YES AND HOW HE DOES EVERY ONE ABOUT HIM
8254-115543-0034 AROUND THE LITTLE BRAHMIN'S NECK IS A THIN CORD OR THREAD WHICH IS A SIGN OF HIS HIGH CASTE
8254-115543-0035 MEANWHILE THE HAUGHTY LITTLE BRAHMIN ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HIS HEAD TURNED AWAY SO NO ONE COULD SEE HIM EAT AND THEN GROWING TIRED OF RESPECTFUL GLANCES IN THE CROWD AROUND HIM HE GOT INTO HIS LITTER AGAIN AND THE SERVANTS FASTENED THE CURTAINS TIGHTLY ROUND HIM
8254-115543-0036 EVERYBODY SLEPT SOUNDLY IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE SERVANTS WAS BEATING A DRUM MOST OF THE NIGHT WHICH THEY REALLY BELIEVED WAS THE WAY TO KEEP UP EVIL SPIRITS
8254-115543-0037 I THE THIEVES HE CRIED
