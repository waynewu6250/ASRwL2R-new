AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF A PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOUR OF HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY	(116-288047-116-288047-0022)

INDEED THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY	(116-288048-116-288048-0001)
WHY THAT IS DISCREPANCY IN THE HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION	(116-288048-116-288048-0002)

PETER PAUL JOHNS JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY	(116-288048-116-288048-0017)
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF ITS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM	(116-288048-116-288048-0018)
COULD THERE HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM	(116-288048-116-288048-0019)
HOW ELSE IS THIS UNANIMOUS ASSURANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR	(116-288048-116-288048-0020)
HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHAT OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES	(116-288048-116-288048-0021)

YET THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JUDAS MOUTH	(116-288048-116-288048-0023)
ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTIES WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION	(116-288048-116-288048-0024)
MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TO DAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLING CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG	(116-288048-116-288048-0025)
ARE THESE PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED	(116-288048-116-288048-0026)
HOW MANY SELF DELUDED PROPHETS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAD PRODUCED	(116-288048-116-288048-0027)
AND WHO CANNOT NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES	(116-288048-116-288048-0028)

STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR MEDIA AND MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0001)
IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0002)

HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SLOWER	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0011)
THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER AGAINST THE FIFTH WINDOW	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0012)
THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDDEN SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0013)
THE WINDOW WAS UP AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0014)
THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPEN OF THE WINDOW	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0015)

THERE ON THE NETS I SAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0014)
JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPPULETS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0015)
NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0016)
IT IS SO LATE THAT THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0017)
THE ISLANDS WAS AN ISLAND STILL	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0018)
THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THEIR ELEMENTS TILL NOW	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0019)
HE STEADIED HER SOFTLY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0020)
HE PITIED HIM AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0021)
THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE BOLT AND THEY STOOD IN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0022)
HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FAIR FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0023)
I WILL TELL THE PRESIDENT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0024)
HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0025)
BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH A LAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0026)
YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PAARSON	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0027)
HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATING DURING THE WALK	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0028)
THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD COME OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0029)
AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVAS CARROW	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0030)
SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES HE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0000)
HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINEAVANT'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0001)
AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT A PART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0002)
BUT WHICH WAS NOT ALL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0003)
BUT WAS THEY ABLE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0004)
IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DECLARED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0005)
HE DETERMINED TO COME IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0006)
SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE BUT HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0007)
BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELLPOON SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0008)
RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF WITH LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0009)
JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD EIRE HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0010)
SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS ABOVE THE WINDOWS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0011)
NOW I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0012)
DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY ON IT SOMETIMES OH NEVER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0013)
WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SEE SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0014)
IT IS RATHER UNCIVILL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0015)
AS A PUNISHMENT SHE WOULD NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0016)
I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANELLCLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0017)

SAID MISSUS PINEAVN WITH A START	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0020)
BUT JOSCELYN IS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0021)
LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICOLA PINE HAVEN	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0022)
THEN SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0023)
AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF AT THE EATING AND DRINKING	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0024)
HE HAD NOT BEEN WANTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0025)
THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND SHAVED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0026)
THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT A WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0027)
IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED THEM TO FILL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0028)
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURES OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0000)
THE WORK OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0001)
HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COSTS A PERSONAL SURRENDER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0002)
WHEN THE RESOLE IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGIS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0003)
POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD IN IT SOME CHECK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0004)
POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSALVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0005)
ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN RIGHT ENDING FAST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0006)
YET THE VERY VOGUEAL OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0007)
A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISES FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR THE STREET LINING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0008)
THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRING FOUND WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCES WAS INEVITABLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0009)
HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STAGES WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0010)
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY APPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SORT OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0011)
IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES AND THE LEADING CITIZEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0012)
THE OTHER STRONG AND OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0013)
THAT ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0014)
THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCLEYTE BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0015)
HERE AGAIN IS SEEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0016)
THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF SITTERS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PRODUCE ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0017)
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF TRUTH IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0018)
SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY MARRIAGE OF WHICH THERE WERE PLENTY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0019)
BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0020)
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE JANIE'S INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0021)
WE GOT IT AT THE GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM IN THE BALASTON WATTGAGE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0022)
WE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0023)
THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AN I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0024)
ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHERE WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0025)
AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAY I GOT A CLUE HOW TO DO IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0026)
I HAD THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0027)
INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO EDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING IN A CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HIM AND WANTED THE DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0028)
FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOWORKS STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0029)
TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE THE PARADES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON ULCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMBERLESS OTHER DETAILS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0030)
IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTE COMPANY LEASED E O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOWROOMS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0031)
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST ROOMS IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS THE PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0032)
THE EXPERIENCED WITH THE LETTER GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0033)
ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A RAMT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0034)
FOR THE NEXT FOUR O FIVE YEARS SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEEHIVE DAY AND NIGHT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0035)
THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARDERNACLET OF THE CLERK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0036)
I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK I WOULD BREAK IT OPEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0037)
HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGIRS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0038)
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I WOULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0039)
I KNEW NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0040)
SHE DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0041)
I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO DENOISE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0042)
SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMONEA	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0043)
HE WOULD TALK OF ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0044)
ONE TIME HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0045)

IT WAS WINTER AND IT WAS SOWING FIRST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0050)
I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE CUT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0051)
THEN THEY GOT PLEURACAN AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0052)
HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF THANKING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0053)

TO GLORIOUS LONDON	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0003)
SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS ONE ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEAT IN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0004)

IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEVER AND INEFFECTUAL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0000)
THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0001)
WE ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0002)
THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAS OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE VAST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0003)
THE VITALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0004)

I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED HER THIRST	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0014)
IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED YOU TO BLEED HER	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0015)

AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN AGAIN	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0018)
THAT VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL RUBBED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0019)
DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME IN ANOTHER DISORDER YET WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0020)

YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALIZE IT FEROCIOUS TYRANT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0042)
YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND THEY HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0043)
IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENT I	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0044)
MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE WOULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DYES FOR THAT MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0045)

NICCOLO DA MONTES GUTTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENCINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0048)
NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO PUT MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0049)
I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORWARDS TO MY BEST ABILITY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0050)
THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREATER CREDIT HE HAD GAINED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0051)
I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY BUT AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0052)
I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK FOR TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0053)
I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED IT WE MADE HASTE FOR ROME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0054)
WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURES	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0000)
TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE COULD COMPASS HIS PURPOSE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0001)
BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADES THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF CAUANA	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0002)
HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FERRY BOATS THAT STAND AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELERS EMBARKED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0003)
WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE RETURNED TO RESCUE HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0004)
WHEN HE SAW THIS THE ROAN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO COYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPEN TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0005)
NOW ALAS BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM ALONE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0006)
HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FIERCELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0007)
THEN THE ROAN SAID TO THE BOATMEN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0008)
WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE THREE TRAVELLERS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0009)
THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE ROINANT HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0010)
WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RON AND OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0011)
FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM CHILD	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0012)
SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN AND THIEF	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0013)
HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0014)

NO IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0016)
AND HIDING HIS HAIR UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0017)
THREE YEARS AGO AT THE TUANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0018)
HAPPILY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH IN MY HEART	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0019)
ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MARVELLOUS ALIMENT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0020)
THINKING I DID DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0021)
AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALIC	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0022)

TO SAY YOU DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0024)

THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY IN THE MOTHER AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0002)
VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS ALSO RESULT IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0003)
ALL THESE WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT THE CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SON	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0004)
AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS FOR LIFE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0005)
EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILFUL BALANCER OF PROSE AND KHANS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR TIME OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0006)

NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING THE NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0008)
AFTER THIS MANNER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE IS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION TO WHICH MUCH DEPENDS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0009)
OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHEN THE ROOF IS LAID	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0010)
THE HOUSEOWER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0011)
A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABOURERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE RIDGEPOLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCRAMBLED JOYFULLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0012)

NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES A SURVIVAL OF AN OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF CHINESE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0015)
AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE DEATHING OF THE CORPSE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0016)
THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIOUS MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0017)

LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE CEILING ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF TEA	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0023)
SO LONG AS THE COFFIN IS IN THE HOUSE IT SHOULD BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0024)
IT IS HER DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0025)
THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGES BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0026)
INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THESE SYMPTOMS ARE MODIFIED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0027)
A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUKHUZAWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0028)

JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY WAS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0031)
ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWER ARE SENT TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0032)
SOMETIMES WITH THE GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN A PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0033)
ANOTHER FAVORITE ONE AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0034)
IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN AS A BURIAL	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0035)

WHERE IS HE CATE MISS BILLY GASPED THE OLD MAN	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0001)
AUNT HANNAH'S CHEEKS TOO WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES STARRY BUT OF DISMAY AND ANGER THE LAST BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PETE HAD SAID MISS BILLY'S NAME	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0002)
IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO IT OF COURSE IT'S HE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0003)
RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHEN IS HE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0004)
INTERPOSED BILLY TELL MISTER BERTRAM I AM HERE OR WAIT I'LL GO RIGHT ON AND SURPRISE HIM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0005)

PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND THEN ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0010)
BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAY WHEN HE SPOKE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0011)
A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPENED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0012)
DONGLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH THE FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0013)
IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GRAY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS IN THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0014)
THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT IT WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0015)
AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USABLE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0016)

THOUGH SHE WROTE A LETTER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0023)
BILLY LAUGHED GAILY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND COULD NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0024)
AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CAREED FOR HIM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0025)
HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWEET LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0026)
BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LIFE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHTS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0027)
AFTER A MINUTE BILLY STIRRED AND SIGHED SOFTLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0028)

BILLIE PUT A SOFT FINGER UPON HIS LIPS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0031)
BERTRAM KISSED THE FINGER AND THEN SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0032)
WELL WHAT IS THIS IS THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0033)
THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN MISSUS BERTRAM STIRRED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0034)
WILLIAM I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0035)
I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL THEN YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM JANE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0036)

DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GOT READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0040)

BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAM CRAFT AGAIN	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0042)
THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGLE EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0043)
SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GOOD LEFT EYE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0044)
BILLY MY SIR	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0045)
IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAYS A LITTLE LATER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0046)
WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE HIM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0047)
WHAT YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE OCTOBER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0048)
AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER RATHER UNCERTAINLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0049)
YES LAUGHED BILLY DEMURELY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0050)
AH YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM MERRILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0051)
WE WANTED THAT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0052)
YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A STRANGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0000)
A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT THAT HE MUST NOW FULFIL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0001)
TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS EYES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0002)
BECAUSE IN HIS CELLARED DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THE RAW ATTACHMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0003)
AND UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0004)
HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS HATE'S INSTRUMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0005)
HE WROTE TO MARIAN AND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0006)
WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME AND TELL ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0007)
I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF GIFFON AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0008)
BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID I GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0009)
I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME MUSIC	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0010)
POVERTY I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0011)
BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BUFFIN FOR A LONG TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0012)
WAS HE ALSO SO VERY POOR	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0013)
ASKED AMINGY COMPASSIONATELY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0014)
I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED ENTIRELY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0015)
OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP THEM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0016)
PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTIBLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0017)
HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL I SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0018)
HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE FULLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0019)
I AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0020)
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLIND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0021)
IS IT SO SEVERE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0022)
EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS SON IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0023)
OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT HE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0024)
HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDENTIALLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0025)
I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF GOOD WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0026)
IN THERE WAS SILENCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0027)
THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN YOUR POSITION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0028)
RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST SEEN ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0029)
JUST HOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0030)
YOU DON'T NOTICE OF ANY FALLING OFF IN MY WORK RECENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0031)
SO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0032)
SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU FOR THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0033)
HER STORY IN THE GIRL'S PAPERS HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0034)
AND I COULD VERY EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0035)
I SURMISE THAT THE YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0036)
DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE POINTED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0037)
I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND OBJECTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVORABLE WHAT CAN I DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0038)
THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0039)
YES I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRIBBLING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0040)
AGAIN JASPER HELD THE WHITE AND SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0041)
YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND HIS REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0042)
MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLED ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0043)
SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF A HEART	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0044)
WELL HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0045)
HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN I ADDED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0046)
THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE NIGHT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0047)
I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIANA WHAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0048)
YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT ON YOUR WAY JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0049)
MORE OF THAT BRUTE YOU MEAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0050)
BUT YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DON'T	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0051)
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR OWN AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0052)
MISTER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0053)
WILL YE MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0054)
YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLY TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0055)
I SHOULD BE SORE AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0056)
SHE HAD PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0057)
YES I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0058)
HAS HAD ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0059)
WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHO WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0060)
AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT IS FOR HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0061)
SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND I REFLECTED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0062)
AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT NOTHING FROM YOU WHEN YOU WERE MY WIFE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0063)
IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND I WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0064)
ACCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I WILL FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0065)
DO YU THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0066)
THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN WE SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0067)
I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0068)
BUT SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILLING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0069)

WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT FOR THAT IS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0073)
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOUR DISTRUST YOURSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0074)
WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARRY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0075)
HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR INTO SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0076)
I DO ASK IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0077)
HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM AND THE VOICE TREMBLED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0078)
THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR THEIR PARENTS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0079)
DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0080)
IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING TO MY FATHER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0081)
GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIANE I CAN'T STAND IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0082)
I WILL BE FAITHFULL TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0083)
HE HAD MADE A PRETENSE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARTIN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0084)
MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUND OF SOBBING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0085)
IN WHAT CAN THERE BE A MORE SELFISHNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0086)
BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0087)
YOU DON'T LOVE HIM JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0088)
HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY OUR FATE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0089)
IS HE IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0090)
BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU HAD LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0091)
IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT HE DID LOVE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0092)
WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YE HAVE SAID NOW	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0093)
REMEMBER HIM AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0094)
SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WERE MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0095)
WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THEN THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0096)
IT'S A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0097)
MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET YOUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0098)
THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISHNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0099)
THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT HE BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0100)
JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED AS CALMLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0101)

SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE HOWEVER ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0001)
THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN A MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0002)

AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD IN SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSE THAT TIME BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEREFROM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0005)

SO AM I DECLARED NAN VACATION WAS SO LONG ENOUGH I THINK	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0010)
MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FERDY AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0011)
HERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0012)
AND SO OUR LITTLE THINGS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0013)
THEIR CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0000)
IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS OF VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0001)
LIKE ME HE IS A NOVELIST OF TORTURE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0002)
CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR THE DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0003)
HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL FATHER	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0004)
FOR THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0005)
EVEN THE LORD IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0006)
DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE OF NEKHLUDOFF IN RESURRECTIONS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0007)
THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIED SOME ONE IN THE IDIERS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0008)
ONE REASON OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0009)
IF THE TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0010)
HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SUCKER	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0011)
BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH AND A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMED NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0012)
HE TOOK A KNIFE BUT WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0013)
HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTED DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0014)
THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ENNA CORONNINA OR FATHERS AND SONS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0015)
YOU SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0016)
HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND POWER	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0017)
ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTISTER AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0018)
HE WHO INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0019)
IT WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BEARING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0020)
AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE BETRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS AND	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0021)
NOW SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0022)
IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AWAY AND KILL HIM	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0023)
IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POWERFUL AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0024)
NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE IN SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0025)
DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL AND AT ONCE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0026)
ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFFIEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEOKONSKI AGLAYA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VAYA FERUSHENKO NASTASYA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL IVOLGAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0027)
BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE OR THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0028)
MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THAT DEFINITION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0029)
TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORKS IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0030)
AND BOTH VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0031)
ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A CREATURE WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0032)
AS THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0033)
THIS IS ALL IN ONE MEASURE TRUE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0034)
TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRIT A CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0035)
THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CERTAMBOS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0036)
THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEFS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0037)
AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERINGS AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0038)
OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MISHKIN ON THE IDIOT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0039)
HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS A MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0040)
THE NOVELS HAVE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0041)
AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUQUET DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0042)
WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASS THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THEIR PRISON DOORS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0043)
AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN BY THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0044)
THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST BE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0045)
IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND PROPELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0046)
HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT THAT SINGER	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0000)
ITS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0001)
TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDEY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0002)
HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR ON IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0003)
THUS HE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF THE ONE WHO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0004)
THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN A LAST LINE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0005)
THEN PROSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0006)
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME FORM ABOUT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0007)
WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VALED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0008)
CATERING CARE AS AN APPALLING PHRASE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0009)
IS IT A LINE OF GOOD POETRY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0010)
YOU DID NOT COME AND SEARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YE DID NOT COME	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0011)
THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUYE MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0012)
HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT READERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0013)
ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MAY EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0014)
BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN DROWNING'S TRAGEDIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0015)
HIS MIND IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0016)
TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR A HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0017)
TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS OF MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0018)
FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD LONELI WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0019)
BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES ITS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0020)
AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDINGE'S POEMS THE OXEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0021)
WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STORY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING AGAIN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0022)
A MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOOD	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0023)
HE MAY ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0024)
HOW LONG HE CRIES WITH A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0025)
WHERE SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORNED TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0026)
BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION AS SENIOR SOUL'S FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0027)
AND GENERAL HELL HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0028)
SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM NO LOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0029)
AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DIE THEY ON OUR DEEDS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0030)
MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF A WAR	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0031)
THE REAL WORLD TO MISS HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0032)
IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDER'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0033)
FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES WITH BOTH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0034)
HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS WRAPPED IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0035)
LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN HEALTH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0036)
IN BEYOND THE LAST LAMP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRIES OVER SEVERANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0037)
NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON TO YOURS ON ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0038)
THEY WILL BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0039)

IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISNT IT	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0000)
PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER BUT SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE AULDER SISTER WISTFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0001)
DORIES DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0002)

IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL PAINTED NOW	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0010)
TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIR LOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GREAT MOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0011)
IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELA TO SEND IT IN SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0012)
WHY THE WRONG SIDE'S EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PENELOPE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0013)

IT IS NOTHING TO POSSES AND HEIRLOOM AFTER ALL	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0018)
PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY IN THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS THE POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOT OF BLACK VELVET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0019)
SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THEN	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0020)
PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER ENCHANTING	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0021)
SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SAID TO HERSELF	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0022)

AND THEN YOU ARE MY GRAND NIECE SHE SAID	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0025)
WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT ROSE BUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN THIBETTE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0026)
PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE HAD DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0027)
SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSE OLD WAS BROKEN UP	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0028)
OH MY DEAR I AM A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0029)
NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRWORTHER'S SOFT OLD HEAD AFFECTIONATELY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0030)
DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS ARRANGED IN THE TWINED CLING OF AN EYE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0031)
WHEN MISSUS FAIRSWETHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0032)
AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CALLING TO HER FROM BELOW	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0000)

ALL HER DAYS THEY WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0005)
BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHENEVER SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0006)
THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX LIKE THE KITCHEN WHICH SYDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0007)
HER BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED OUT ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0008)

SYDNEY HATED THAT HERO AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD HATE ANYTHING	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0010)
HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SYDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF HER DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0011)

ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KINNAEUS LIVED WITH OBSCERTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDEIA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0007)
AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDIAH SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0008)
WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FACSUS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0009)
WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MAYIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0010)
ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES AND SARAMATAI	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0011)
HE SAID HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0012)
ADA'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AND HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0013)
AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID HE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0014)
HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE SPOIL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0015)
IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE IMMORTAL	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0016)
AND IT MIGHT BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0017)
SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND WE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0018)
SHE HAD A DULL FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0019)
KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF EYAS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0020)
THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH FAITH OF A DRAGON	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0021)
IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS AS I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0022)
BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF SO BRAVE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0023)
THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES INTO THE GROUND	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0024)
I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUSS AS IT IS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0025)
AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDIA GROW WIDE AS WITH JOY	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0026)
PHRONTIS AND MELLISH WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0027)
THEN AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0000)
AFTERWARD SHE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0001)
THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THEIR ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0002)
THEREAFTER ADMETUS HAVING NO LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0003)
A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS BUT ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0004)
BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT GLORY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0005)
WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID IDMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0006)
BUT SO APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0007)
HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS IN THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0008)
ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO LONGER LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0009)
IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS AND ADMETUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0010)
IF WE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0011)
AND THEN HE CAME UPON THE ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0012)
THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF A COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0013)
HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GOETH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0014)
BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD LET DEATH COME NEAR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0015)
ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF YE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0016)
THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0017)
ONE SHOULD GET IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KEEN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0018)
NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STEP	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0019)
IT WAS NOT SO SLOW FOR HIM AS BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0020)
AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THEY HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0021)
DEATH WOULD SOON BE NEAR FOR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0022)
NO NOT HERE FOR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0023)
HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE HALL	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0024)
NO MORE SPEECH WENT FROM HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0025)
AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOVE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0026)
TO WHAT GOD IS THERE SACRIFICE DUE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0027)
AND THEN HERACLES THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER LABOUR WAS BEFORE HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0028)
I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOLD OF THE UNDERWORLD	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0029)
WHY SHOULD I NOT SRIVE WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0030)
AND WHAT A NOBLE THEME IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FEARFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0031)
HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMEGUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0032)
YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH BUT YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0033)
AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES SHOULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0034)
SHE WAS VEILED OR ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0035)
HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON FROM AN ENEMY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0036)
THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I'VE HAD PAIN ENOUGH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0037)
THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD DRAWN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0038)
HE NOW RAN ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0000)
CHRISTIAN I HAVE BEEN TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0001)
CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO SAINT ZION	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0002)
I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD GIVE ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0003)
HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MAN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HELD NEAR HIS HEAD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0004)
THAT CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0005)
AND HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0006)
CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0007)
AND YOU NEXT SAW A MAID COMING IN TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0008)
JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAUS HIS LOAD SLID FROM ITS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0009)
AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT WOMANS CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACED FROM THY SINS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0010)
CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IT IS THIS BLESSED CROSS BLESSED TOMB	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0011)
HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS OF THEIR FEET	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0012)
CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GET	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0013)
FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT DYIN FOR PRAISE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0014)
KNOW YER NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0015)
THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG NEWS HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0016)
YET SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0017)
AND IF WE'RE GETTING THE WORD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0018)
HAS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0019)
I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE HEAD OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0020)
NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK TO IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0021)
NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME IN MIGHT REST THERE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0022)
TIMARU SAID THAT TSUYING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0023)
YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY SHOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0024)
YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FELT IN THIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0025)
HE FELT FOR IT OR FOUND IT NOT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0026)
SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN HE WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0027)
OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHIUGH HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0028)
SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE DEATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0029)
HOW FAR SHALL I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0030)
NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SKULL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0031)
WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCROW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0032)
HE LAID IT OPEN IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0033)
WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAP THE HEEL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0034)
NOT THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRINGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0035)
THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HAUL AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0036)
FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NEITHER	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0037)
KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PAST AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0038)
THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY UNTIL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE A WATCHFUL DWELT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0039)
CHRISTIAN SIRE WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0040)
WHEN WATCHFALL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME HERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0041)
THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITHIN FROM THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0042)
HAIDEE COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0043)
CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD SAY IT OF ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0044)
PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MONTHIARN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0045)
THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVES THE LORD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0046)
CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES THEY HAVE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0047)
CHARITY AS WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0048)
BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME SEE THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0049)
THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN THE LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG HIS HYMN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0050)
AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JOHN BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAIN AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0051)
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIANE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0052)
THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANNIUS LAND	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0053)
MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD AND ARE NOW HIS JUDGE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0000)
JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAS TO SAY	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0001)
THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THIS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS BEEN SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0002)
THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO PRAY THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0003)
COME GOOD HELPFULL SAID CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0004)
SO THEY SET OFF OVER THE FIELDS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0005)
HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE ME A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0006)
HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR THY GOOD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0007)
CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO DOWN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0008)
THEN SAID DRYLY IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0009)
THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS WE KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FORT	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0010)
AND BY THIS ACT WILL CURE OUR SOULS AS WELL	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0011)
FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN COULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0000)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THEY HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0001)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DISBEARED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0002)
SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOW THIS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0003)
THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM THE PROBABILITY OF MEN AND OTHER ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0004)
NOW WHATEVER IS PARTICULAR IS PAID IT IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0005)
THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN AS PROVED TO BE NATURAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0006)
THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE ORDAINED ALL THIS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0007)
THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LEFT THE ANIMALS TO MAN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0008)
SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0009)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE SAFE INNOCENT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0010)
MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATE THEM IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0011)
THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THIS STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEANOR OVER PLANS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0012)
NOW HE MEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0013)
I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF THE OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNITY HAVE BEEN STERILE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0014)
THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN PROBABLY DISPARITY	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0015)
IN EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTS OF NATURE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0016)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN HIS STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0017)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE AND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0018)
IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRING IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0019)
SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND A MAN FOR TWO REASONS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0020)
BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WILDERNESS OF OLD AGE	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0000)
ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY A GENERATION	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0001)
THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0002)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0003)
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DOUBT I SAID	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0000)
AND I SAW TO MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0001)
HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SAVAGELY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0002)
HIS COOL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0003)
EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENCE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDINGLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0004)
I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER IF HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0005)
SHE PUT HER HAND ON MINE MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0006)
HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO TRUELY TO ME SHE ASKED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0007)
YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SHORT IS ALL YOURS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0008)
WHAT WERE YOU TALKING OF	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0009)
IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING TOO	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0010)
DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNES THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0011)
IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING BACK THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0012)
AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND CHILD I SAID	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0013)
IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF HE HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0014)
IN SUCH A POSITION AS MIND	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0015)
A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK COUSIN IN PRISON FOR DEBT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0016)
AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR ME FOOD AND SHELTER	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0017)
AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILDHOOD	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0018)
BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME AND HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0019)
BUT MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0020)
THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS ENOUGH WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0021)
THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS HER STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0022)
AND WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0023)
HOW CAN YOU HOW SHALL YOU SPEAK OF IT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0024)
I YIELDED AND SPOKE OF IT NEVER MORE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0025)
EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHO WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0026)
BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESSLY INFATUATION	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0027)
I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I THOUGHT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0028)
LET ME DESERVE OF TO BE FORGIVEN	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0029)
IT IS ANYTHING TO BE YOUR ONLY FRIEND	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0030)
YOU MUST HAVE MY PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0031)
COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED CHEERFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0032)
MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO THAT DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0033)
A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF THE LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0034)
I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRANDTS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0035)
DOES SPEAKING OF HIMSELF AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0036)
NOR NEED YOU HESITATE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0037)
YOU KNOW HOW THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETIES	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0038)
AND NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0039)
THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF A PRISON	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0040)
YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED A EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0041)
UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF THIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0042)
THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THE FOUR WORDS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0043)
IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN AND SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0044)
WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT A DIRECT INTEREST ON HER DEATH	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0045)
THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION MY ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0046)
I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE BUT HE WAS A MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0047)
YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN REPLIED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0048)
I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU BELIEVE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0049)
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON HER POLICY OF INSURANCE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0050)
I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SADLY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0051)
WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY LOVERS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0052)
THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHY AND EXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE IT CAN BE OF USE TO YOU	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0053)

I COULD HONESTLY PROMISE THAT A	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0056)
MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM OUR KNOWLEDGE THE COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0057)
HE ROSE TO GO WHILE MY RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0058)

THE OLD PORTER WAS HERE DIRECTING AND SCOLDING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0002)
THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION IN AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0003)
BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER IN HER DOLLY JACK A SORT OF A LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SEWN BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0004)
BESIDES THE FAMILY THERE WERE MANY FRIENDS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THE SLOW MOVING WAGON	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0005)

THESE HEAVY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS RUN QUITE WILD	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0010)
HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED OVER HIS HANDS	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0011)

NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MANY TRAVELLERS AS INDIA	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0013)
SOME OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0014)
WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE CAME TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEAR THEM	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0015)
PERHAPS THEY ARE DOGS SAID MAHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CANE DOWN BY THEIR STREAM	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0016)

AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST DOWN A ROAD	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0020)
IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING IN STATE ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJA OR RULERS OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MODERN INDIA WAS FORMERLY MADE UP	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0021)
FIRST THERE CAME A GREAT ELEPHANT ALL DECORATED WITH SILK AND GOLD AND SILVER	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0022)
ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS THE HAOUDAH WHICH WAS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS THE RAJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLOURED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0023)
