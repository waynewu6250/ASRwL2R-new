MY FATHER'S IS HIS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0008)
SO HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0009)
YOU'VE HEARD HERE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0010)
I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME NOTHING OF HIS AFFAIRS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0011)
MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING YOU FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0012)
WITH THAT THIS EVENING	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0013)
THERE ON THE NETS THEY SAID	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0014)
JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SONS OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0015)
NO I SHALL GET ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0016)
IT IS SO LOW THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0017)
THE ISLAND WAS AS AN ISLAND STILL	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0018)
THEY HAD NOT REALISED THE FORCE OF THE ELEPHANTS TILL NOW	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0019)
HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM WHEN SHE MADE NO OBJECTION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0020)
HE PITIED HER AND WELL HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0021)
THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOAT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GAS LIGHT OF THE PASSAGE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0022)
HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS AND IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0023)
I WILL ASK THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0024)
HE FOUND RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0025)
BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANTS CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0026)
YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GOOD GIRL SAID PEARSON	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0027)
HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THIS CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0028)
THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING I HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0029)
AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE ABBES CAROS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0030)
SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES US	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0000)
HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINEAVAN'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF THEIR OTHER FACIAL DETAILS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0001)
AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT A PART WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0002)
BUT HIS WAS NOT ALL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0003)
SO WAS HE ABLE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0004)
IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DECIDED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0005)
HE PROMISED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0006)
SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING AN HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0007)
BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POOL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO GO	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0008)
RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN A CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0009)
JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD HEIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS THE NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0010)
SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAVE BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0011)
YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME DAYS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0012)
DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES OH NOT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0013)
WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED AT SURPRISE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0014)
IT IS IT RATHER UNCIVIL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0015)
AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE MIGHT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0016)
I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANELPLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0017)
JOSCELYN PIERSSTONE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0018)
OH DIDN'T HE MEET HER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0019)
SAID MISSUS PINEAVANS WITH A START	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0020)
BUT JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S FACE WITH LONG STRIDES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0021)
LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMP LIGHT NICCOLA PINE HAVEN	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0022)
AS SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0023)
AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR HER EATING AND DRINKING	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0024)
HE HAD NOT BEEN AWAKENED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0025)
THE SPRING IN THIS PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0026)
THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER CALLING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0027)
IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR A POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0028)
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THIS STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0000)
THE WAY OF THIS INVENTOR IS HARD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0001)
HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST IN PERSONAL SURRENDER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0002)
WHEN THE RESOLVE IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGES OR FORBID ITS VERY USE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0003)
POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWED IN THE VERSION IS SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD AND YET SOME CHECK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0004)
POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVETICISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A WHOLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0005)
ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN RIGHTED FAST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0006)
YES THE VERY VOGULAR OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0007)
A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTNING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISES FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR THE STREET LINING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0008)
THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRING FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCES WAS INEVITABLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0009)
HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN FIFTY SEVEN PER CENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0010)
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY APPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMICAL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0011)
IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATIONS HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES AND THE LEADING CITIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0012)
THE VERY STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0013)
THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS FOUND	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0014)
THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE THE ARCLIGHT BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0015)
HERE AGAIN ARE GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0016)
THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRITS SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HUNDREDS OF SITTERS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0017)
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK LIFE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0018)
SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY HARVEST OF WHICH THERE WERE PLENTY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0019)
BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED AS ACTIVE ILL WILL	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0020)
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENIAL INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY EPATHETIC	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0021)
WE GOT IT AT THE GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM IN THE BALASTON WATGAGE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0022)
WE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0023)
THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY BACK IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0024)
ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0025)
AFTER FEELING ALONG FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLUE HOW TO DO IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0026)
WE THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0027)
INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO EDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING A CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWERS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0028)
FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTOR THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOWORTH STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0029)
TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE THE PARADES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON OORCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMBERLESS OTHER DETAILS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0030)
IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLY LIGHT COMPANY LEASED THE O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOWROOMS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0031)
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THIS CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0032)
THE EXPERIENCED WITH THE LITTLE GAS ENGINES WAS RATHER STARTLING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0033)
ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A MINT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0034)
FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY NINE WAS A VERITABLE BEE HIVE DAY AND NIGHT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0035)
THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARDERNACHLET OF THE CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0036)
I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY COULD BREAK IT OPEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0037)
HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SECTORS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0038)
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I CAN PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0039)
I THINK NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0040)
I DID N'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0041)
I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO DENO	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0042)
SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMOE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0043)
HE MIGHT TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0044)
WHAT NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0045)
AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE THIRTY AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0046)
ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIBRIGATE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0047)
HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FOUR LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0048)
SPEAKING OF TELL US DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN'S STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAMB FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0049)
IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS HAULING FIRST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0050)
I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE COVER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0051)
AND THEN THEY GOT PLEURACIAN HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0052)
HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF FACTTING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0053)
NOW NO ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0054)
LONDON IS GONE AND GLORY	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0000)

I GLORIOUS LONDON	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0003)
SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WONDERFUL ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEATEN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0004)
THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWN AT COUCHES	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0005)
WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERING AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE INFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR THE NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0006)
OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THE SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD IN GLOWING EXPECTATIONS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0007)
OFT EXPORTATION FOULTS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST E PROMISES AND OFT HE HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLIPS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0008)

THE BLACK JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE A WORD FOR IT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0011)
I HAVE SENT MY LIFE UPON THAT CASTE AND WILL WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0012)

IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I THOUGHT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0000)
THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WOODS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0001)
THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER INTO THEIR HANDS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0002)
THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE HIGHEST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0003)
THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS CRIMINAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0004)
HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS UPON HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0005)

HE HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT CONSTRUCTION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0009)

TO SPEAK THE TRUTH HE HAD WANTONLY INVOLVED HIMSELF IN A MULTITUDE OF SMALL BOOK DEBTS OF THIS STAMP WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING EUGENIUS'S FREQUENT ADVICE HE TOO MUCH DISREGARDED THINKING THAT AS NO ONE OF THEM WAS CONTRACTED THROUGH ANY MALIGNANCY BUT ON THE CONTRARY FROM AN HONESTY OF MIND AND A MERE JOCUNDITY OF HUMOUR THEY WOULD ALL OF THEM BE CROSSED OUT IN COURSE	(2506-169427-2506-169427-0002)

I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORWARD TO THE BEST ABILITY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0050)
THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR THEY USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0051)
I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT A VERY LITTLE RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0052)

IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO THAT OF COURSE IT'S SHE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0003)
RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER THERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE IS HE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0004)

AND PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0010)
BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GREY WHEN HE SPOKE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0011)
THE FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON HIS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0012)
DOGLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0013)
IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GREY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS IN THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0014)
THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL NOTHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0015)
AS THOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USABLE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0016)

DEMANDED BERTRAM ANGRY AND MYDIFIED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0018)
AS FOR MY NOT PAINTING AGAIN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE DEARS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0019)

AH SHE WROTE A LETTER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0023)
BILLY LAUGHED GAILY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND WOULD NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0024)
THEN YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0025)
HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF MY EYELIDS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0026)
BILLIE WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0027)
AFTER A MINUTE BILLY STIRRED AND SIGHED RAPIDLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0028)
YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARKWRIGHT AND	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0029)

THEY PUT A SOFT FINGER ON HIS LIPS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0031)
BERTRAM KISSED THE FINGER AND SUBSIDED HUMPHS HE COMMENTED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0032)
WELL WHAT WAS THAT IS THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0033)
THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERTRAM UTTERED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0034)
BILLY I'M GOING TO MEET YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0035)
I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL AND YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0036)
I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW I'LL GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUND THIS LAW I FORGOT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0037)
FIVE DAYS INDEED FOR	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0038)
I WONDER IF YOU THINK THAT I CAN GET READY TO BE MARRIED IN FIVE DAYS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0039)
DON'T WANT YOU TO BE READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0040)
IF WE REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE BUT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0041)
BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAM CRAFTIER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0042)
THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD THEIR OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0043)
SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GOOD LEFT HAND	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0044)
TO BILLY MY DEAR	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0045)
IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DRAWING A LITTLE LATER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0046)
WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAMS IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0047)
YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE OCTOBER I	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0048)
AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER EARNESTLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0049)
YES NODDED ALICE DEMURELY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0050)
YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM MERRIILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0051)
THEY WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0052)
YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND PLEASURE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0000)
A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT THAT HE MUST NOW FULFILL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0001)
TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE THEM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0002)
BECAUSE IN HIS SADDLED DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0003)
UNABLE TO SPEAK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0004)
HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIANO WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0005)
HE WROTE TO MARIANO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0006)
WILL YOU LET ME HEAR O COME AND SEE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0007)
I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFENCE AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0008)
BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THEN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0009)
I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING SOME NEWS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0010)
POVERTY I CAN ONLY SUFFER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0011)
BUT I WILL SEE WHELPSDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFEN FOR A LONG TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0012)
WAS HE STILL SO VERY POORLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0013)
ASKED AMY AND COMPASSIONATELY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0014)
I'M AFRAID SIR HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0015)
OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE NOTHING TO HELP HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0016)
PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WERE IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0017)
SHE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0018)
HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE PERFECTLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0019)
AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG CHRISTIAN WOMEN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0020)
SOMETIMES NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0021)
IS IT SO DEAREST	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0022)
EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS RIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0023)
OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT A	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0024)
HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FOLLOW DESPONDENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0025)
I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ATTEMPT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0026)
THERE THERE WAS SILENCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0027)
THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITIONS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0028)
CALLED WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0029)
AND JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0030)
BUT YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN MY WORK RECENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0031)
DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CARRIAGE AND SO ON GENERALLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0032)
SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0033)
HER STORY IN THE GIRL'S PAPER HAD ATTRACTED ATTENTION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0034)
AND WE COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0035)
I SURMISE THAT AND YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0036)
DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PULLED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0037)
I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND OBJECTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT CAN I DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0038)
THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I KNOW FOR MY ADVICE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0039)
WELL I'LL COME BACK TO MY SCRIBBLING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0040)
AGAIN JASPER KEPT THE WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0041)
YET THROUGH SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0042)
HENRY COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0043)
SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER HEARTS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0044)
HE BEGAN AN ABRUPTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0045)
HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED YET ADDED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0046)
THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN AT THE BATTLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0047)
I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN WHEN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0048)
YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPERY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0049)
MOST OF A BRUTE YOU MEAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0050)
YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DO DON'T	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0051)
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OTHER AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0052)
I	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0053)
WILL YOU MARRY ME TO LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0054)
YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR WIFE AT PRESENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0055)
I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECTS ON HIS HEALTH JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0056)
SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHEDLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0057)
HERE I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0058)
HAS ONE THING OCCURRED TO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0059)
WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A MAN WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0060)
AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN IT IS BEFORE HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0061)
SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0062)
AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU WERE A WIFE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0063)
IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WHILE THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0064)
ACCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS DAUGHTER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0065)
AND DO YOU THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0066)
THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THIS PLAIN TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0067)
I DON'T TRUST HERSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0068)
BUT SHALL YOU FACE ME WILLINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0069)
PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA M	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0070)
WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXPLAINED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0071)
EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK IT SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0072)
WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT WHEN THAT IS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0073)
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUSTS YOURSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0074)
WE MUST HEAR EACH OTHER AGAIN MARIAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0075)
HOW AM I TO LIVE FOR AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0076)
I DO WISH IT WERE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0077)
HER EMOTION HAS AN EFFECT ON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0078)
THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERY THING TO HER PARENTS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0079)
YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CANN'T YOU ADVISE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0080)
IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY POWER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0081)
GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIAN I CANN'T STAND IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0082)
I WILL BE FAITHFUL WITH YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0083)
HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING THIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0084)
MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING AND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0085)
IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESSES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0086)
THEN I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0087)
YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF LIFE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0088)
HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY FAINT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0089)
IS THERE IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0090)
BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REGRET	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0091)
IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I MAY LOVE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0092)
WHAT CAN YE SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0093)
REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE YOURSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0094)
SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0095)
WHY CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0096)
IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THE HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0097)
MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS FOR WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0098)
SO THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0099)
THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST AND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0100)
JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN HE ASKED CALMLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0101)

GOOD BYE SHE GAVE HIM A HAND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0105)
THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIANNE LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0106)
JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A BITTER HUMILIATION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0107)
HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN ITS TONES AND ASPECT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0108)
A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0109)
YESTERDAY MORNING THEY RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0110)
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND NOW SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0111)
YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE WITH MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0112)
SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A RETURN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0113)
I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL READ TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0114)
WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENTS WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0000)
TWELVE DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0001)
THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THEIR SURVEYS	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0002)
INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN AND ARTILLERY	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0003)

UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0005)
AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION MY VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0006)
THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTEE TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG BUT THAT HE HIS SON WAS A DEMOCRAT	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0007)
I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY PREVIOUS ISSUE	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0008)
NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE MORE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0000)
IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM THREE INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0001)
IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOR THIS IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0002)
BUT PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED AT THEIR WORK	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0003)
HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HOOP THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0004)
AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A WIND OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0005)
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH PEASANT OR OTTER HOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0006)
THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BRED BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HARRIER AND BEAGLES ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBOROUGH HOUND SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0007)

SHOULDERS ARE CLEAN AND SLIGHTLY SLOPING	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0013)
FORELEGS QUITE STRAIGHT WELL UNDER THE DOG OF A GOOD SUBSTANCE AND ROUND IN THE BONE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0014)
FEET ROUNDS WELL KNUCKLED UP AND STRONGLY PADDED	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0015)

ALL THINGS THAT FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTRIBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BE INFINITE OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE ETERNAL AND INFINITE THROUGH THE SAID ATTRIBUTE	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0000)
PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT THE SOMETHING IN SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD CAN FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THE SAID ATTRIBUTE AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE OR DURATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSING IN THE ATTRIBUTE THOUGHT	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0001)
IN ITS NATURE IN INFINITE	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0002)
WHO MUST NECESSARILY EXIST	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0003)
WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONSTITUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0004)
AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD IN SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSE THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEAS OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEREFROM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0005)
BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANYTHING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE MEASURE	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0006)
COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN SCHOLASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS ECCENDIARUM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0007)
COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MODES BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPECTED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0008)

YOU ARE BOTH RICH NOW AREN'T YOU REMARKED DOROTHY	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0002)
AND DOROTHY WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE A PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S PROUD SISTERS	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0003)
AN WE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DOROTHY	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0004)
COME NELLIE CALLED MISSUS MC GLAUGHLAN I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAIR	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0005)
SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NELLIE TOLD HIM	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0006)
MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN MAKE US THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0007)
MOST OF EM I GUESS ANSWERED BERTIE	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0008)
WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD VACATION AND I AM WILLING TO GO TO WORK	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0009)
SO AM I DECLARED NAN VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I KNOW	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0010)
MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND ON ALL HANDS EVEN FREDDY AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0011)
THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP OF THE CAT	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0012)
AND SO OUR GOOD FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0013)
HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL FROM EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0000)
AND IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0001)
LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF STORY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0002)
CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THIS LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0003)
HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL WARRIOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0004)
BUT THEY ARE EVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICTS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0005)
EVEN THE THOUGHT IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0006)
DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE AT NEKHLUDOFF IN RESURRECTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0007)
THIS IS A MAD HOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE IDIERS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0008)
THE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0009)
AGAIN THE TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0010)
HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HEAD BUT WITH THE SUCK	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0011)
BUT HE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMED NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0012)
HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSEDING HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0013)
HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE TO DOSTOEVSKY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0014)
THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ENNA GORENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0015)
WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO OR DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0016)
HE IS A GROTESQUE MAKE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0017)
ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST HIS ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0018)
HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUERS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0019)
WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CAPS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0020)
AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MENIACS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0021)
SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY AND	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0022)
IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I' WILL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0023)
IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0024)
NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE AND SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0025)
DOSTAEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW HIM ALL IN AT ONCE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0026)
ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFFIEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEOKONSKI AGLAYA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VAYA FERUSHENKO NASTASIA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL YVOLCAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0027)
BUT THAT SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0028)
MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THE DEFINITIONS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0029)
TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT WAS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0030)
AND THEN VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0031)
ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH TAUGHT TO KNOW	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0032)
BECAUSE THEY ARE SUGGESTED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0033)
THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE DUE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0034)
TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DEATH AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0035)
THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CERT AVOS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0036)
THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELPS THOU MINE UNBELIEF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0037)
AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING IN DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0038)
OR EVEN TO THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MISHKIN IN THE IDIOT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0039)
HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK IN THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0040)
THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE WOMAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0041)
AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VARGAS DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0042)
WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAS SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0043)
AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF ALL SLAVONIC SAINTS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0044)
THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM HER NOVELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0045)
IT IS HIS FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0046)
BUT HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0000)
HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STONE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0001)
TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE THE GREAT POET	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0002)
HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR OF IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0003)
THUS HE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THEN OF ONE WHO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0004)
THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN HIS IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0005)
AND PROSE INTRUDES IN HIS CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0006)
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED ON THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM ABOUT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0007)
WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE HER THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0008)
CATERING HOWEVER IS AN APPALLING PHRASE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0009)
IS A LINE OF GOOD PROPERTY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0010)
YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS A HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0011)
THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUULE MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0012)
HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSIBLE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0013)
ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF THIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0014)
BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWN'S TRAGEDIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0015)
HIS WORLD A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0016)
TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS BY BROWNING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0017)
TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED HIS SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0018)
FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEART'S GROWN COLD TO ME COULD LONELY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0019)
BUT ONLY TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0020)
AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HOSEA'S POEMS THE OXEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0021)
WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THAT STORY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0022)
THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDER'S PREVAILING MOOD	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0023)
HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE LONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0024)
SO LONG HE CRIES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0025)
WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LANDS AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORN TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0026)
BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION A SENIOR SOUL FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAD KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0027)
AND GENERAL ILL HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0028)
SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THAT NEW LOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0029)
AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY BLOW THEY ON OUR DEEDS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0030)
MISTER HARDY HAS TOO PRETTY A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0031)
THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS CAME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0032)
IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDYS'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0033)
FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE THE EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0034)
HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS ROSE IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0035)
LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE IN DEATH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0036)
IN BEYOND THE LAST GATE WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0037)
NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILST EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON TO YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0038)
THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OURS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0039)
NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDER'D PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0040)
IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER IS N'T IT	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0000)
PENELOPE HAS STARTED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE AULDER SISTER WISTFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0001)
DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ON THE NEXT DAY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0002)
SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMIRED HIM FOR THE WORLD	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0003)
SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO ASK A NEW DRESS	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0004)
YOURIS HUNTER I BELIEVE IT'S AN OLD QUILT	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0005)
THUS PENELOPE MY DEAR DORIS	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0006)
LOVE TO PENELOP AND YOUR SELF	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0007)
YOUR AFFECTIONATE AUNT ADELA COUNTESS	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0008)
I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A GAY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0009)
IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE AND IT IS ALL FADED NOW	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0010)
TO TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0011)
IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELA TO SEND IT SAID DORY DUTIFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0012)
WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS IT EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PENELOPE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0013)
WHAT LOVELY OLD THYMEY STUFF AND NOT A BIT FADED	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0014)
I DECLARE IT IS AS GOOD AS NO	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0015)
WELL LET US GO AND HAVE CHEESE SAID PENELOPE I'VE DECIDEDLY HUNGRY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0016)
BESIDES I SEE THE POVERTY BOGGER COMING	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0017)
IT IS SOMETHING TO BOSSES AND HEIR LOOM AFTER ALL	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0018)
PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEARTED COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY IN THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS THE POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0019)
SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS IS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0020)
PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER STRANGE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0021)
SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HIMSELF	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0022)
MY AUNT ADELA GAVE ME IT GAVE US THE MATERIAL SHE STAMMERED	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0023)
I'M NAMED AFTER HER MISSUS FAIRWATER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVELY OLD FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND HAPPINESS	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0024)
THEN YOU ARE MY GRAND BEAST SHE SAID	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0025)
WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT ROSE BUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN TRIBET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0026)
AND PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0027)
SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND A HOUSE HOLD WAS BROKEN UP	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0028)
BUT MY DEAR I AM A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0029)
NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRFORDER'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0030)
DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS CHANGED IN THE TWINED CLING OF AN I	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0031)
WHEN MISSUS FAIRBWETHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0032)
AS HE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0000)
AUNT JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND HER YEAR OLD BABY CLANGING TO THE OTHER	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0001)
SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND VULGAR AS A SUNFLOWER WAS UNCLE JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0002)
I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BIGGSBY IS THIS EVENING SIDDY AND WE MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0003)
SYDNEY SIGHED AND WENT DOWN STAIRS FOR HER BABY	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0004)
ALL OF HER DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0005)
BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO RIDE HER LETTER	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0006)
THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MARE BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SYDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0007)
OUR BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0008)
JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A BLUE AND THE MOUTH ZIG ZAGGED FROM EAR TO EAR	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0009)

FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF CRETHEUS AND CRETHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMIS THEIR GRANDFATHER	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0003)
JASON TOOK PELIAS AND TELAMON WITH HIM AND	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0004)
AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHRIXUS WENT INTO THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0005)
THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PALACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF A MORNING	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0006)
ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KINNAEUS LIVED WITH OBSYRTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDIA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0007)
AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDINA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0008)
WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FASCIUS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0009)
WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES IN GREECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0010)
ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SERMATAI	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0011)
HE WITH HIS COMRADES MIGHT SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0012)
ADAI'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0013)
AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID I	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0014)
HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF HIM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0015)
IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE MULTITUDES	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0016)
OR IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0017)
SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND THEN SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0018)
SHE HAD A DARK FACE WHO WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0019)
KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF EYIS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0020)
THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES AND WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0021)
IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU MY GOLDEN FLEECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0022)
BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITIES EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0023)
THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GRASS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0024)
I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS HEAD AS IT IS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0025)
AS HE SAID THIS I SAW THE EYES OF MEDIA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0026)
PHRONTIS AND MELLIES WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0027)
AND AS A MODEL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0000)
AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT MIND	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0001)
THIS WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0002)
THEREAFTER ADMEUDUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0003)
A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM THEN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0004)
BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT GRACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0005)
WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE OH APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID IDMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0006)
BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A VOICE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0007)
HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ALWAYS IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0008)
ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THAT GREEN EARTH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0009)
IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS AD MEDEUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0010)
IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU MAYST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0011)
AND THEN THEY CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0012)
THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST SHOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0013)
HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH IT	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0014)
BUT WHEN I HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0015)
ADMETUS TOOK A MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0016)
THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING TO HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES AROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0017)
ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KEENE AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0018)
WHEN THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0019)
IT WAS NOT AS TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0020)
AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONTENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0021)
DEATH WOULD SOON BE DONE FOR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0022)
NO NOT HERE FOR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE HOUSE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0023)
HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE VALLEY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0024)
NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM ME	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0025)
AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDES THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0026)
TO WHAT MAN IS THAT SACRIFICE DUE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0027)
AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER BLOW WAS BEFORE HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0028)
I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS BACK INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0029)
WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE HER DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0030)
AND WHAT A WONDERFUL THEME IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0031)
HE LEFT THE PALACE TO ADMETUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0032)
YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THAT TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0033)
AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF IT WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0034)
SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER CHEEKS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0035)
HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO A HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0036)
THIS I I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PAINS ENOUGH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0037)
THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS LIFE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0038)
HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOORS OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0000)
CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0001)
CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO COUNT ZION	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0002)
I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME ALL THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0003)
HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR PEACE AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0004)
SAID CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0005)
THEN HE TOOK ME TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0006)
CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS IS THIS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0007)
THEN YOU NEXT SAW A MAID COMING IN TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAY IT LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0008)
JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAUS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF A TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0009)
AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST REJOICED FROM THY SINS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0010)
CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CROSS BLESSED TONGUE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0011)
HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHINS ON THEIR FEET	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0012)
CHRISTIAN SISTERS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0013)
FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZIONN FOR PRAISE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0014)
YOU'RE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0015)
THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0016)
YES SIR SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0017)
AND IF YOU'RE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0018)
IS NOT OUR SENSE AS GOOD AS YOURS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0019)
I SAW THEN AND THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0020)
NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEY WENT UP THE HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0021)
NOW HALF WAY UP WAS THAT CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0022)
TIMARA SAID THAT TWYING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0023)
YES SAID MISTRUST AND JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0024)
THEN HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0025)
HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT OUT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0026)
SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CLOAK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0027)
OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHILO HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0028)
SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAYS OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS SLEEP	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0029)
HOW FAR MIGHT I HA BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0030)
NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP IN HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0031)
WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCROB	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0032)
HE LAID IT UP AT THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0033)
WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEPS DID HE NOW CLAMB THE HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0034)
HAH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRINGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0035)
THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT THE CHRISTIAN MADE HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0036)
FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE TEETH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0037)
KEEP IN THIS MIDST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0038)
AND I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE THE WATCHFUL DWELT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0039)
CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MIGHT I REST HERE TO NIGHT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0040)
WHEN WATCHFULLY TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0041)
THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITHIN TOWARD THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0042)
HIGHITI COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0043)
CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0044)
PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MONTHIAH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0045)
THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I MUST DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0046)
CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN ENOUGH I HAVE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0047)
CHARITY IN WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0048)
BUT THEY DID NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0049)
THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG AN HYMN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0050)
AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAYING AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0051)
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID TRISTRAM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0052)
THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANSUS LAND	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0053)
MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL TO YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0000)
I JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0001)
THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE US YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0002)
THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR A TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0003)
COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID THE CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0004)
SO THEY SET OFF FOR THE FIELD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0005)
HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT O THE RIGHT PATH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0006)
HOPEFULS SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0007)
CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TURN TO GO BACK	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0008)
THEN SAID DRY IN DESPAIR YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0009)
THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT WE WERE IN FORD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0010)
AND BY THESE ACT WE CURE OUR SOULS AS WELL	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0011)
FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0000)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OVER THE ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0001)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD HIS BAIT NOTHING DISBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0002)
SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWES GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0003)
THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PRINCIPLE OF MEN AND OTHER ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0004)
NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PARTED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0005)
THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE UNNATURAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0006)
THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS EITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0007)
THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET THE ANIMALS TO ME THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0008)
SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A LIVE MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0009)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE SIMPLE INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0010)
MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABED MEN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0011)
THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEANATION OVER PLANS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0012)
NOW EMMAN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0013)
I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEXES AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNITY HAVE BEEN STERILE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0014)
AND THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0015)
AND EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE IN THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0016)
ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0017)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO A MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0018)
IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING OR DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0019)
SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE CONSISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0020)
BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO HAPPINESS OF OLD AGE	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0000)
ON THE CONTRARY EVERY THING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THAT STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0001)
THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODIES AND POWER	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0002)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROFESSION IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0003)
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT SAID	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0000)
AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT YOU HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0001)
HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHERE HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0002)
HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAVE FALLEN ON US	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0003)
EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENCE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAYS BITTERLY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0004)
I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM HE LOVES	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0005)
SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE SHE COULD SAY ANY MORE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0006)
HOW CAN YOU THINK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE ASKED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0007)
YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART OF SECRET IS ALL YOURS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0008)
WHAT REASON ARE YOU TALKING OF	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0009)
IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH THE WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0010)
DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THAT MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0011)
IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I HAVE NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0012)
WHEN YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0013)
IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS OUR CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0014)
IN SUCH A POSSESSION AS MINE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0015)
A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A MOCKING HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0016)
AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR SOME FOOD AND SHELTER	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0017)
AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF A CHILD	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0018)
BAD AS HE IS HE WAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0019)
MY ONLY FEAR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0020)
THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO WOULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD IN THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0021)
THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS A STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0022)
THOUGH WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0023)
HOW SHALL YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF IT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0024)
I YIELDED AND SPOKE OF THIS NO MORE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0025)
EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0026)
BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE THIS HOPELESS INFATUATION	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0027)
I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU'VE FORGIVEN ME I SAID	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0028)
LET ME DESERVE HER TO BE FORGIVEN	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0029)
IT HAS SOMETHING TO BE YOUR ONLY FRIEND	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0030)
YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP THAT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0031)
COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN HE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0032)
MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF THE CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0033)
A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0034)
I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRAND	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0035)
DOES SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS THREATS I ASKED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0036)
WHY NEED YOU HESITATE TO	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0037)
YOU SAY THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETIES	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0038)
NEVER LET ME TELL YOU OF THE PLAIN TRUTH	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0039)
THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR THEIR GETTING OUT OF PRISON	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0040)
YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO DAYS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0041)
UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DOUBT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0042)
AND THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0043)
IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HIS OWN MISTRESS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0044)
WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER LIFE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0045)
THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN OUR REACH	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0046)
I CAN OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS THE MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0047)
YOU ARE NOT MISTAKEN I REPLIED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0048)
I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN TO RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0049)
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW THE MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0050)
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SAVAGELY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0051)
WILL YE LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYERS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0052)
THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHY AND EXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO ME	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0053)
CAUTIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSED MYSELF HER DELICACY TOOK THE CHARM	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0054)
PROMISE THAT YOU DON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU FROM MISTER VAN BRANDT SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0055)
I COULD HONESTLY PROMISE THAT IT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0056)
MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM MY KNOWLEDGE THE COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0057)
I ROSE TO GO WHILE MY RESOLUTION SOON SUSTAINED ME	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0058)
KISS HIM SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU GO	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0059)
IT IS ONLY YOUR GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERS HIM	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0060)
THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR HIS JOURNEY	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0000)
EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF GREAT ORDERS	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0001)
THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING AND CONDUCTING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0002)
THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION WHEN AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT THROUGH THIS GATEWAY	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0003)
BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER IN HER DOLLY DUCK A SORT OF A LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SOWN BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0004)
BESIDES THE PARTY THERE WERE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THE SLOW MOVING WAGON	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0005)

THEY LOVELY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS RUN QUITE WILD	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0010)
HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OR BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0011)

NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MANY BEGGARS AS IN INDIA	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0013)
MANY OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MADE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0014)
WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG MEN WENT TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEAR THEM	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0015)
PERHAPS THEY ARE DOGS SAID MAHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CANE DOWN BY THAT STREAM	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0016)

FIRST HERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT ALL DECORATED WITH SILK AND GOLD AND SILVER	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0022)
ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS THE HOWDAH WHICH WAS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS A RAJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLORED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0023)

AND ALL THE REST OF THE TIME THE LITTLE FOLK TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE GREAT RAJA AND HIS ESCORT	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0027)
OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS OR BARGAINING FOR FOOD AT THE LITTLE BOOTHS	(8254-115543-8254-115543-0028)
