THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0018)
THEY HAD NOT REALISED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0019)
HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARMS AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0020)
HE PITIED HER AND WHILST HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0021)
THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GAS LIGHT OF THE PASSAGE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0022)
HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0023)
I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU SOMETHING TO EAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0024)
HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SAT ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0025)
BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0026)
YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PIERSON	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0027)
HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF A CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0028)
THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF HIS ATTIRE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0029)
AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE ABBES CARRO	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0030)
HE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0000)
HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PANAVAN'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0001)
AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART AWHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0002)
THIS WAS NOT ALL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0003)
WAS HE ABLE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0004)
IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FARTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0005)
HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY UPON THE NEW INCARNATION	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0006)
SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTON SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0007)
BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELLPOOL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0008)
RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOKS SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0009)
JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD AIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0010)
SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0011)
YES I HAVE MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0012)
DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES O NEVER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0013)
WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MUTTERED IN SURPRISE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0014)
IT WAS RATHER UNCIVIL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0015)
AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL AND LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0016)
I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANELCLIFF'S OTHER NIGHT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0017)
JOSCELYN PIERTON	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0018)
O DIDN'T HE MARRY HER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0019)
SAID MISSUS PANAVAN WITH A START	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0020)
BUT JOCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0021)
LADY ARRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMP LIGHT NICOLA PINE HAVEN	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0022)
SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST RIVAL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0023)
AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR EATING AND DRINKING	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0024)
HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0025)
THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC RECOMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0026)
THE LADY ON JOSCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0027)
IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATE FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0028)
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0000)
THE WAY OF INVENTOR IS HARD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0001)
HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESS FOR COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0002)
WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOUR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGIS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0003)
POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD AND YET SOME CHECK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0004)
POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0005)
ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN BRIGHTENING FAST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0006)
YES THE VERY VOGUE OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0007)
A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR THE STREET LINING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0008)
THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRED IN FACT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0009)
HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WAS ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0010)
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY APPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0011)
IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES IN THE LEADING CITIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0012)
THE OTHER STRONGER OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0013)
THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHEWN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0014)
THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCLADE BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0015)
HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0016)
THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HUNDREDS OF CITIES THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0017)
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTERESTS IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0018)
SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WAS PLENTY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0019)
IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0020)
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0021)
WE GOT IT AT THE GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM AND THE BALLASTON WATTAGE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0022)
WE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0023)
THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT ON TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0024)
ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0025)
AFTER FEELING ROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLUE HOW TO DO IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0026)
I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THEIR WORK NICELY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0027)
INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO EDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING IN A CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0028)
FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOWORK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0029)
TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WORCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMBERLESS OTHER DETAILS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0030)
IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTE COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOWROOMS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0031)
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0032)
THE EXPERIENCE WITH A LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0033)
ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A RANT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0034)
FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEEHIVE DAY AND NIGHT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0035)
THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARNOCLET OF THE CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0036)
I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM OUT IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0037)
HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGRES AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0038)
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND OLD PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0039)
I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THAT MATTER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0040)
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0041)
I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO THE NOTICE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0042)
SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMONE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0043)
HE COULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0044)
ONE DAY HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0045)
AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLINS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0046)
ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0047)
HE WILL GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0048)
SPEAKING OF TELLERS DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAND FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0049)
IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS HAWING FIRST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0050)
I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE COLD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0051)
THEN THEY GOT PLEURACIAN AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0052)
HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF ACTING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0053)
NO ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0054)
LONDON ITS GOLD AND GLORY	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0000)

STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE OLD STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAMS STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UTTERED THE FOLLOWING ORRITORICAL FLIGHT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0002)
GLORIOUS LAND	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0003)
SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS ONE ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEATEN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0004)
THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR COUCHES	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0005)
WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERING AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE INFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0006)
OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THE SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WITH GLOWING EXPECTATIONS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0007)
OFT EXPORTATION FOULS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST E PROMISES AND OFT HE HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLITS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0008)
DUSIS ONE DABBLE WHEN SIX IS TREBACOY	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0009)
WILLEM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CENO POT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0010)
THE POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE A WORD FER IT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0011)
I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON THE CAST AND WILL WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0012)
I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT PAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0013)
IF HE HAD DROPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCCO	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0014)
THE PREEN'S SHOP WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVERN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0015)
JAMES BURRYBRIDGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS BLUFF MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0016)
IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAD BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0000)
THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLES OF THE WEST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0001)
THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE A SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0002)
THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE WEST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0003)
THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH THE MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0004)
HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MODEL RIGHT TO IT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0005)
HAD THEY ACQUIRED A TRUE LOVE OF FREEDOM	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0006)
THE GREAT EPOCH OF THE SOUL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHABARA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0007)
WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS STIRRED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTHS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0008)
IT HARDENED TO AN AGE OF INERT CONSTRUCTION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0009)
THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ODOUR WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0010)
LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR MENTAL FUNCTIONS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0011)
BY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GRIPE OF AN INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE AND GROWTH	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0012)

THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER SAYING IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED ON THE SPOT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0012)
AFTERWARD HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0013)
I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAVE ENTIRELY QUENCHED MY THIRST	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0014)
IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED HER TO BLEED HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0015)
IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED ON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0016)
YOU MIGHT HAVE BOASTED OF HIS CURE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0017)
AT THOSE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0018)
THE VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0019)
DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0020)
THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HANDS AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0021)
SO I MAKE MY MIND UP AND PREPARED TO TRAVEL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0022)
THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIERRE LANDIE WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0023)
NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE A GUTTO WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0024)
I HAD HARBOURED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0025)
MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DA MONTEVERCHI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0026)
THERE THEY STOOD ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0027)
MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THE WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0028)
AT THESE WORDS MAESTRA AGOSTINO THE DUKE'S TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0029)
GIORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MYASTHRO AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED THERE IS THE MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NOT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0030)
AS FIERCELY AS I COULD NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED GEORGIO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0031)
HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO AND THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THE SWORD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0032)
MAESTRO AGOSTINO RETORTED YOU GALLOWS BIRD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0033)
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT FOR CERTAIN	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0034)
GIORGIO MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0035)
THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY WHERE I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND HE HALTED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0036)
THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MARVELED I WAS STILL ALIVE AFTERWARDS HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0037)
WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTERETTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0038)
I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND TOLD HIM ALL THE AFFAIR OF THE MINT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0039)
HE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE YOUR VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECTED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0040)
I THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIETRO PAGOLO ADVICE ABOUT STAMPING THE COINS AND THEN WENT OFF ON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE DUKE OR ANYBODY ELSE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0041)
YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALISE THAT FEROCIOUS TYRANT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0042)
YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANY THING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0043)
IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS A SON OF POPE CLEMENT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0044)
MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DYE FOR THAT MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0045)
I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF HIM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0046)
I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENZINO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0047)
NICCOLO DA MONTE GUTTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENCINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0048)
NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON THIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0049)
I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A VERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0050)
THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0051)
I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECES READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0052)
I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CAN NOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0053)
I LIFTED MY HEAD AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0054)
WE HAD SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0000)
TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST WAS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0001)
BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADES THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF CUANNA	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0002)
HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELERS EMBARKED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0003)
WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIESTS STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0004)
WHEN HE SAW THIS THE ROAN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPEN TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0005)
NOW ALAS BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD I AM LEFT ALONE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0006)
HE SPOKE SO MEANINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0007)
THEN THE ROANIN SAID TO THE BOATMAN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0008)
WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELERS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0009)
THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONAND HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0010)
WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONON OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KYOTO	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0011)
FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0012)
SINCE THEN ALL HAD GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0013)
HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0014)
AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TO KOBAY FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERY MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0015)
NOW IT CHANCED THAT THIS STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0016)
AND HIDING HIS HAND UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0017)
THREE YEARS AGO AT THE KOANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0018)
HAPLY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0019)
ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MARVELOUS AILMENT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0020)
THINKING I COULD DIVINE THE CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0021)
WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALICE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0022)
REPENT THEREFORE AND ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAY	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0023)
TO SEE YOU SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0024)
BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TORMENT YOU	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0025)
IN THE FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROB YOU	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0026)
FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN AND THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOMEDAY OVERTAKE ME	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0027)
HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE UNTIL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0028)
BUT HOW YOU MANAGE TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0029)
A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF THE STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0030)
EVERY WELL ORDERED JAPANESE HOME OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTER OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOUSE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0000)
SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST AND ANNIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0001)
THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHER AS A SAFE GUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0002)
VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITION TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0003)
ALL THESE WERE PUT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT A CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SON	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0004)
AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0005)
EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILLFUL BALANCER OF PROSE AND KHANS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0006)

NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY COULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0008)
AFTER THIS MATTER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE IS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0009)
OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHEN THE ROOT IS RAISED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0010)
THE HOUSEOWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0011)
A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABORERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGE POLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCRAMBLE JOYFULLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0012)
ALL COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CAN NOT COME SEND SERVANTS OR PROVISIONS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0013)
ON THE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN A CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS THE STYLE COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0014)
NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES THE SURVIVAL OF AN OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0015)
AT THE APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0016)
THERE'S NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0017)
UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0018)
WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IT IS DRESSED IN WHITE AND SILK BABO TIE WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0019)
THE BODY TOO BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0020)
THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THE COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0021)
THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEED THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANKS OF THE RIVER OF DEATH	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0022)
LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED WITH BAGS OF TEA	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0023)
SO LONG AS THAT COFFIN IS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0024)
IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD OF THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0025)
THERE ARE A FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0026)
INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THE CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0027)
A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUKISWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0028)
IN HIS WILL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING AND THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0029)
THROUGH THIS GROWING FEELING IN THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0030)
JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THAT HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0031)
ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS WERE SENT TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0032)
SOMETIMES WITH A GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0033)
ANOTHER FAVOURITE PRESENT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0034)
IT SEEMED MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURIAL	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0035)
DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET UP IN THE DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0036)

MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ALLAN'S HORSE AND CARRIED THE GOODS	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0004)
ALLEYNE ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT OF HIS RETURN THEY WERE SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTLE'S WHO MARRIED PRISCILLA RAMSAY WITH A SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0005)

PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASKED IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0010)
HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN HE SPOKE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0011)
THE FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0012)

BILLY LAUGHED GAYLY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0024)
AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLIE THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0025)
HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THE SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0026)
BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHTS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0027)

WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0046)
WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS THERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0047)
YOU MEAN IT WILL BE BEFORE OCTOBER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0048)

YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE PUT IN BERTRAM MERRILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0051)
WE WANTED IT TOMORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0052)
YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN SPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0000)
A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFILL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0001)
TO SHUFFLE OUT OF HIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0002)
BECAUSE IN HIS CELLAR DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0003)
UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENTS PARK	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0004)
HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARION WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0005)
HE WROTE TO MARTIN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0006)
WILL YOU LET ME HERE OR COME AND SEE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0007)
I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFON AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0008)
BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT HERE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0009)
I HOPED HE WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0010)
I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0011)
BUT I WILL SEE WHELPSDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFIN FOR A LONG TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0012)
IS HE STILL SO VERY POOR	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0013)
ASKED ANDY COMPASSIONATELY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0014)
I AM AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0015)
O IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0016)
PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HOPELESS LOVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0017)
HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0018)
HAVING THE SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0019)
AMY MAY TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0020)
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER WAS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0021)
IS SO SERIOUS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0022)
EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0023)
OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0024)
HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FALL DESPONDENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0025)
I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND ON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0026)
THERE WAS A SILENCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0027)
THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAD MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0028)
RECOLLECT WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0029)
JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0030)
YOU DIDN'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN MY WORK RECENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0031)
DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CORNER AND SO ON GENERALLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0032)
SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHERE THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0033)
HER STORY IN THE GIRL'S PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0034)
I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0035)
I SURMISED THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0036)
DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH AN IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0037)
I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVORABLE WHAT CAN I DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0038)
THIS CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0039)
I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRIBBLING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0040)
AGAIN JASPER HELD A WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0041)
YET FOR SUCH FEELING HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0042)
MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE UPON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0043)
SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEAT OF HER HEART	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0044)
SHE BEGAN ABRUPTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0045)
HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED AND ADDED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0046)
THERE WERE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE BATTLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0047)
I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARION WHAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0048)
YOU'RE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0049)
MORE OF A BRUTE YE MEAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0050)
YE KNOW VERY WELL I DON'T	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0051)
I HAD MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0052)
YES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0053)
WILL YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0054)
YOU FELT YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0055)
I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT ON HIS HEALTH JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0056)
SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED AT HIM TOUCHINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0057)
DEAR I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAS BECOME BLIND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0058)
ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0059)
WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAINE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0060)
AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN IS BEFORE HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0061)
SHE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0062)
AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU ARE MY WIFE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0063)
IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0064)
EXCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0065)
DO YE THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0066)
THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARION YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0067)
I DIDN'T TRUST MYSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0068)
AND SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILLINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0069)
PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MARION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0070)

WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT THAT IS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0073)
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEANT BY SAYING YOU DISTRUST YOURSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0074)
WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MADAME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0075)
HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0076)
I DO WISH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0077)
HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT UPON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0078)
THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING TO HER PARENTS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0079)
YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THAT WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0080)
WAS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY FATHER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0081)
GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARY I CAN'T STAND IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0082)
I WOULD BE FAITHFUL TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0083)
HE HAD MADE A PRETENSE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0084)
MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY A SOUNDLESS SOBBING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0085)
IN WHAT COULD THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0086)
I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0087)
YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERY THING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0088)
HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY FAITH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0089)
IS IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0090)
IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0091)
IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE I DID LOVE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0092)
WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0093)
REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVES SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0094)
SOON ENOUGH YOU WILL THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0095)
WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0096)
IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0097)
MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0098)
THAT SEEMED TO ME CHILDISH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0099)
THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE THE AUTUMNAL MIST	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0100)
JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ANSWERED CALMLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0101)

GOOD BY SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0105)
THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREES OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0106)
JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO WAS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0107)
HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TONES AND ASPECT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0108)

YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED THE FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0110)
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0111)
YOU WERE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0112)
SEVEN DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0113)
I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CAN NOT TELL ME TOO MUCH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0114)
WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0000)
SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANISED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0001)
THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0002)

NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0000)
IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE WRITING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0001)

AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON THE LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0005)
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTERHOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0006)

MUST NECESSITY EXIST	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0003)
WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONSTITUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0004)
AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD IN SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSED THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEREFROM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0005)
BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANY THING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0006)
COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN SCHOLASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS ECCENDI REM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0007)
COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MODES BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPLAINED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0008)

MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FREDDIE AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0011)
THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDE DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0012)
AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATIONS	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0013)
HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL INTO EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0000)
IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISIONS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0001)
LIKE THEM HE IS THE NOVELIST OF TORTURE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0002)
SURELY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0003)
HE MAY NOT BE A TRUE AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0004)
BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICTS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0005)
EVEN THE LOSS IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0006)
DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE OF NEKHLUDOFF AND RESURRECTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0007)
THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIED SOME ONE IN THE ADIAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0008)
ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTIONS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0009)
EVEN THEIR TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0010)
HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH A SUCK	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0011)
BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMED NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0012)
HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0013)
HE NEVER PAINTS ANY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0014)
THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ENNA CORRENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0015)
WE SYMPATHISE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0016)
HE IS GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0017)
ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST'S AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0018)
HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUE AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0019)
WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0020)
AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0021)
SERVES HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0022)
IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0023)
IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAD BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0024)
NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS ON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0025)
DOSTAEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0026)
ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFFIEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEWKONSKI AGLEA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VAYA FERUSHENKO NASTASIA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL YVOLGAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0027)
THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0028)
MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS A DEFINITION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0029)
TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0030)
AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0031)
ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF THE MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0032)
IF THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0033)
THAT IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0034)
TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRIT OR CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0035)
THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CETEVOS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0036)
THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETERS LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0037)
AND BEYOND THAT DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0038)
OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MISHKIN AND THE IDIOT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0039)
HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF HIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0040)
THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0041)
AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUGUY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0042)
WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THEIR PRISON DOORS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0043)
AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THE LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0044)
THAT IS THE PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0045)
IT IS THE FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0046)
HE WAS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0000)
HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF NIGHT AND STORM	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0001)
TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDEE IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0002)
HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0003)
THUS HE WRITES I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0004)
THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE OF THE LAST LINE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0005)
AND PROSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0006)
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN A PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM ABOUT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0007)
WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THE THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0008)
CATERING IS AN APPALLING PHRASE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0009)
IS THE LINE OF GOOD POETRY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0010)
YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YE DID NOT COME	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0011)
THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUEL MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0012)
HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0013)
ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND BUST TO NAME A FEW	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0014)
WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0015)
THIS WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0016)
TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0017)
TO HAVE LIVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0018)
FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD LONELY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0019)
BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LETS PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0020)
AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARD'S POEMS THE OXEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0021)
WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THE STORY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0022)
THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDEY'S PREVAILING MOOD	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0023)
HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0024)
HOW LONG HE CRIED IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0025)
WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GOD LIKE SCORN TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0026)
BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION AS SENIOR SOUL FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0027)
AND GENERAL HELL HOLD OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0028)
SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND NEW LOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0029)
AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DO THEY ON OUR DEEDS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0030)
MISTER HARDY HAD TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0031)
THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS A WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0032)
IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARD'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0033)
FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATIONS ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0034)
HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS ROLLED IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0035)
LOVERS ARE ALWAYS REVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0036)
AND BEYOND THE LAST LAMP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0037)
NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL UNTO YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0038)
THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH A EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0039)

DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THE NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0002)
SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED IT FOR THE WORLD	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0003)

IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT'S ALL FADED NOW	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0010)
TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIR LOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0011)
IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELA TO SEND IT SAID DORA DUTIFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0012)
WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT SAID PENELOPE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0013)

IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSES AND HEIRLOOM AFTER ALL	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0018)
PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY IN THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS THE POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0019)
SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0020)
PENELOPE THOUGHT HER CHARMING	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0021)
SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HERSELF	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0022)

PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS AND WE WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0027)
SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSEHOLD WAS BROKEN UP	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0028)
MY DEAR I'M A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0029)
NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRWORTH'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0030)
DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS CHANGED IN THE TWIN CLING OF AN EYE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0031)

SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0006)
THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SIDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0007)
HER BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRLS SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0008)

HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN ON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0015)
IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE IMMORTALS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0016)
AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLD FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0017)
SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0018)
SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLD HAIR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0019)
KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ERIS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0020)
THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH THE TEETH OF A DRAGON	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0021)
IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLD FLEECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0022)
BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CAN NOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0023)
THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES ON THE GROUND	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0024)
I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS SAD AS IT IS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0025)
AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDEA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0026)
PHRONTIS AND MELLS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0027)
AND AS MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0000)
AFTERWARDS PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0001)
THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0002)
THEREAFTER ADMEUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0003)
A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO CAME TO HIM AGAIN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0004)
APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0005)
WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0006)
BUT APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0007)
HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THE CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0008)
ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK ON THE GREEN EARTH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0009)
IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS ADMETUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0010)
IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON TO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0011)
THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0012)
THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURT YARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0013)
HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0014)
BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME IN THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0015)
ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOETH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0016)
THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES AROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0017)
ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KING AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0018)
NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEM TO STOP	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0019)
IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE TO HIM AS BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0020)
IN THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0021)
DEATH WILL SOON BE HERE FOR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0022)
NO NOT HERE FOR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0023)
HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0024)
NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0025)
AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0026)
TO WHAT GOD IS THE SACRIFICE DUE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0027)
AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOR WAS BEFORE HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0028)
I'VE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0029)
WHY COULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0030)
AND WHAT A NOBLE THEME IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THAT FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0031)
HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMEUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0032)
YOU ARE HELD BY DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0033)
AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISE THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0034)
SHE WAS VEILED ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0035)
HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0036)
THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I'VE HAD PAINS ENOUGH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0037)
THEN ADMETUUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0038)
HE NOW WENT ON UNTIL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0000)
I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0001)
SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0002)
I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN WHO STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0003)
HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MAN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0004)
CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0005)
THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MEN TO SWEEP IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0006)
WHAT MEANS THIS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0007)
THEN YOU NEXT SAW A MAID COMING TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAID IT LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0008)
JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAUSE HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0009)
AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACED FROM THY SINS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0010)
CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CHRIST BLESSED TOMB	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0011)
HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0012)
CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO WE GO	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0013)
FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT DIEN FOR PRAISE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0014)
KNOW YOU'RE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0015)
THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG YOUTH HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0016)
YES SAID HE NO DOUBT OF IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0017)
AND IF WE'RE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ARTS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0018)
IS OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0019)
I SAW THEN THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0020)
NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0021)
NOW HALFWAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0022)
TIMARA SAID THAT TSING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0023)
YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0024)
YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0025)
HE LOOKED FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0026)
SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR HIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0027)
OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHILL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0028)
SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SLEEP	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0029)
HOW FAR MUST I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0030)
NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT ON HIS CLOAK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0031)
WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCROLL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0032)
HE LAID IT IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0033)
WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAMB THE HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0034)
HA THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRINGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0035)
THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS MY STRENGTH SO SMALL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0036)
FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HAVE NONE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0037)
KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0038)
THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE THE WATCHFUL DWELT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0039)
CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TONIGHT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0040)
WHEN WATCH TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0041)
THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITHIN INTO THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0042)
HAIDEE COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0043)
CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT SHE SHOULD ASK IT OF ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0044)
PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MONTHIAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0045)
THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVED THE LORD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0046)
CHARITY HAD YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0047)
CHARITY WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0048)
THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0049)
THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN THE LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0050)
AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAIN AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0051)
WHAT IS THE NAME OF HIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0052)
THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANIUS LAND	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0053)
MORE THAN THIS HE HAS BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0000)
CHURCH THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0001)
THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THUS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0002)
THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0003)
COME GOOD HELP SAID CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0004)
SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0005)
HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAD BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0006)
HOPEFUL SAID NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0007)
CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOT STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0008)
THEN SAID DRAKE IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0009)
THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FORT	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0010)
AND BY THIS ACT WE CURE OUR SONS AS WELL	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0011)
FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER A MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0000)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0001)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS BAIT NOTHING DISMAYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0002)
SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWEVER GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0003)
THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0004)
NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAID IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0005)
THEREFORE THIS SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0006)
THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON EXCEPT FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0007)
THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET THE ANIMALS TO MAN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0008)
SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BAD MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0009)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THIS SAFE INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0010)
MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATE MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0011)
THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEAN OVER PLANS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0012)
NOW IN MEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0013)
I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNITY HAVE BEEN STERILE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0014)
THERE MUST ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0015)
AN EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTS OF NATURE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0016)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0017)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0018)
IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED MASTER	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0019)
SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0020)
BUT IN THAT STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0000)
ON THE CONTRARY EVERY THING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0001)
