MY FATHER'S IS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE REGIMENT HARD BY	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0008)
BUT HE COULD AFFORD THE MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0009)
YOU'VE HEARD OH	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0010)
I I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0011)
MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR HER EXTRAVAGANCE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0012)
I WAS THAT THIS EVENING	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0013)
THERE ON THE NETS THEY STARTED	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0014)
JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUE TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPEULETS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0015)
NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH DOWN IF EVER I REACH IT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0016)
IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STABLE WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0017)
THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND SOON	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0018)
THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS NOW	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0019)
HE STEADIED HER QUIETLY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0020)
HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED THE DETERMINATION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0021)
THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD IN THE GAS LIGHT OF THE PASSAGE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0022)
HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF A YOUNG WOMANHOOD	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0023)
I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO IT AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0024)
HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE WOULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0025)
BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAIDS SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0026)
YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PEERSON	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0027)
HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD INITIATED DURING THE WALK	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0028)
THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING ABOUT HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0029)
AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVES CARROW	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0030)
SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES A	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0000)
HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PANAVIN'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0001)
SOMETIMES THEY KEPT APART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0002)
THEN THIS WAS NOT ALL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0003)
BUT WAS IT ABLE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0004)
IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTE DEMANDED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0005)
HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEXT INCARNATION	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0006)
SHE LIVES NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0007)
BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELLOOS SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0008)
RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER TO THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0009)
JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD AIRE HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0010)
SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A HORSE'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0011)
WELL I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0012)
DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES WHY NEVER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0013)
WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE EXCLAIMED IN SURPRISE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0014)
IT IS NEVER UNCIVIL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0015)
AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIGHT HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0016)
I SAW HIM AT LADY CHATELCLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0017)
JOSCELYN PIERCENT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0018)
OH DIDN'T I MARRY HER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0019)
SAID MISSUS PINEVENE WITH A START	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0020)
BUT JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING INTO THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0021)
LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICCOLA PINE HAVEN	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0022)
SHE HAD NOT BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0023)
AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM WHILE ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0024)
HE HAD NOT BEEN INVITED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0025)
THE SPRING IN THAT PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0026)
THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF ENGLAND WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0027)
IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS TELLING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0028)
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0000)
THE WAY OF THE INVENTER IS HARD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0001)
HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT THE DISTRESS OF COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0002)
WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIALS OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGIS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0003)
POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS VIEWED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD AND IT SOME CHECK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0004)
POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THEIR ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVETICISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A WHOLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0005)
ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN WORTHENING FAST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0006)
YES THE VERY VOUGAL OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0007)
A NUMBER OF PARENT ARCLINEING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR THE STREET LINING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0008)
THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRED IN THOUGHT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF FORCE WAS INEVITABLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0009)
HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WAS ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0010)
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SISTERS HAS DIED OUT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0011)
IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE PRESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES IN THE LEADING CITIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0012)
THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THAT GAS INDUSTRY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0013)
THERE ALSO THE MOST BRITISH FEELING WAS SHOWN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0014)
THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCLANDE BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0015)
HERE AGAIN IS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN BY ITS ENEMIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0016)
THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF CITIZENS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0017)
THIS MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0018)
SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY ARRIVAL OF WHICH THERE WERE PLENTY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0019)
BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE SELF WILL	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0020)
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE JEANIE'S INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0021)
WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AN ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM IN THE BALLASTON WATGAGE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0022)
WHO SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0023)
THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT ON TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY ABOUT IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0024)
ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GOOD CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0025)
AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I FOUND A CLUE HOW TO DO IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0026)
I THEN MADE ANOTHER CHAIN WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0027)
INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO ADAM THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING IN A CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0028)
FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOWORTH STREET NEW YORK AND THAT WAS ALSO EQUIPPED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0029)
TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE PARATHES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON OOCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMBERLESS OTHER DETAILS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0030)
IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLIGHT COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0031)
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THAT CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS THE PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0032)
THE EXPERIENCED WITH THAT LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0033)
ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A MART	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0034)
FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY THREE WAS A VERITABLE BEE HIVE DAY AND NIGHT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0035)
THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARDERNAACLET OF THE CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0036)
I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK HE WOULD BREAK IT OPEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0037)
HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGURES AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0038)
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND THE PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0039)
I THOUGHT NOTHING MORE ABOUT THE MATTER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0040)
I DIDNT REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0041)
I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO DEPOSE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0042)
SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMANEE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0043)
HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING THE VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0044)
ONE MORNING HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0045)
AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHT HIS VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0046)
ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF LONDON FIBRIGATE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0047)
HE WOULD GO OUT AMONGST THE FIRE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0048)
SPEAKING OF TELLERS DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LEN FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0049)
IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS NOWING FIRST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0050)
I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE CROWD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0051)
THEN THEY GOT PLEORACIAN AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0052)
HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF FASTING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0053)
NOW THE ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0054)
LONDON IS GREAT AND GLORY	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0000)

STANDING ON A BROKEN COLUMN OF THE OLD STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAMS STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UTTERED THE FOLLOWING ORRITORICAL FLIGHT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0002)
GLORIOUS LONDONS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0003)
SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WONDER ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEATEN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0004)
THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR LONGING COUCHES	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0005)
WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERING AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE ENFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHUS TILL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0006)
OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THE SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNES FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WITH GLOWING EXPECTATIONS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0007)
OFT EXPORTATION FOULTS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST HE PROMISES AND OFT HE HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLIPS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0008)
DUSIS ONE DEBIL WHEN SIX IS TREBACOY	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0009)
WILLEM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA ON THE CENOPOT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0010)
THE POLITE JACK SAID ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE A WORD FOR IT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0011)
I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON THE CASTE AND WILL WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DAY	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0012)

THE PREENY SHOP OF FOWL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVEN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0015)
JAMES BURRIBAGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS PLUMP MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0016)
IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECAME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0000)
THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THAT PEOPLE OF THE WEST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0001)
THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE NO SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0002)
THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE PRESENT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0003)
THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILLS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0004)
HE WHO DESIRES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0005)
HAVE THEY ACQUIRED A TRUE LOVE FOR FREEDOM	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0006)
THE GREAT EPOCH OF THE SOUL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHABAA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0007)
WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS STRUCK IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0008)
IT HARDENED THROUGH AN AGE OF INERT CONSTRUCTION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0009)
THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO THE CONVENTIONAL ODOUR WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0010)
LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR IDEAL FUNCTIONS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0011)

IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED YO TO BLEED HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0015)
IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING THREE FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0016)
THEY MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HIS CURE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0017)
AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACES AGAIN	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0018)
A VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0019)
DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME IN ANOTHER DISORDER THAT WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0020)

IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DICK ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0044)
MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DYLES FOR THAT MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0045)

NICCOLO DA MONTERE GUTTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LOREZCINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0048)
NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE BUT THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0049)
I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FURTHER TO MY BEST ABILITY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0050)
THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR HE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0051)
I HOWEVER DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0052)
I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT THE MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0053)
I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROMAN	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0054)
THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0000)
TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I WOULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0001)
BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADE'S THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF CUANNA	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0002)

WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0004)
WHEN HE SAW THIS THE ROIN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPEN TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0005)
NOT ALAS BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0006)
HE SPOKE SO KNOWINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0007)
THEN THE ROKAN SAID TO THE BOATMAN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0008)
WHICH THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0009)
THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONEN HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0010)
WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONON OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO QUIYOTO	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0011)
FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE CARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0012)
SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER SAID ASSASSIN NOR THIEF	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0013)
HE WOULD HAVE FLED IN THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0014)

AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVERLET HE SAT QUIVERING ALL OVER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0017)
THREE YEARS AGO AT THE CUANO FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0018)
HAPLY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLED THE WISH OF MY HEART	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0019)
ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF THEIR MARVELLOUS AILMENT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0020)
THINKING I COULD DIVINE SOME CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0021)
AND WOULD IT NOT STILL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALICE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0022)

TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THIS HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0024)

BUT HOW YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL ALIVE WAS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0029)

THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE FATHER AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0002)
VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES WITH RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0003)

AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME WELL USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0005)
EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILLFUL BALANCER OF PROSE AND KANTS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0006)

OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE WAY WHEN THE ROOF IS RAISED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0010)
THE HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER WAS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0011)
A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABOURERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE RIDGEPOLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SCRAMBLE JOYFULLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0012)

NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES A SURVIVAL OF AN OLD TYPE OF NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0015)
AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL OF THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0016)
THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES NOR ATTEND THE FUNERAL	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0017)

LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF HAY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0023)
SO LONG AS THE COFFIN IS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CAREFULLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0024)
IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GET OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0025)
THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING IS THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0026)
INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE BEST FEATURES OF THESE CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0027)
A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUCUMSAWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0028)
IN HIS WILL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE CARRIED WITHOUT WASHING IN THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0029)
WITH THIS GROWING FEELING AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0030)

SOMETIMES WITH A GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN HIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0033)
ANOTHER FAVOURITE PRESENT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHIST IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0034)
IT IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURIAL	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0035)

A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LONG CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0012)

THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOME THING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0015)
AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM AS WAS USABLE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0016)

WHEN SHE WROTE A LETTER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0023)
POLLY LAUGHED GAYLY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0024)
AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE JIMMY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0025)

IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THAT DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0046)
WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE US	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0047)

YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WELL CUT IN BERTRAM MERRILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0051)
WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO STAY ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0052)
YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD THAT SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0000)
A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH WE MUST NOW FULFILL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0001)
TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM QUITE IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0002)
BECAUSE IN HIS CELLARY DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0003)
UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THAT HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0004)
HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S INFANT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0005)
HE RODE TO MARIAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0006)
WILL YOU LET ME HEAR YOU COME AND SEE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0007)
I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFINE AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0008)
BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID SHE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0009)
I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME NEWS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0010)
POVERTY I CAN ONLY SUSPECT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0011)
BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFAN FOR A LONG TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0012)
WAS I STILL SO VERY POOR	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0013)
ASKED AMY COMPASSIONATEALLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0014)
I'M AFRAID SO HIS BROTHER FAILED UTTERLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0015)
OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO HELP HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0016)
PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOSS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0017)
HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HER ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0018)
HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE CLOSELY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0019)
AMY YOU MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0020)
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH A BLINDNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0021)
IS IT AS SERIOUS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0022)
EVEN IF MISTER ELE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0023)
OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT WE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0024)
HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND PLAY DESPONDENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0025)
I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF THE WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0026)
THERE WAS SILENCES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0027)
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0028)
TO RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0029)
JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF SOME LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0030)
YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN THE WORK RECENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0031)
DO YOU SEE MY THINGS AT THE CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0032)
SOMETIMES I WONDER I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0033)
HER STORY IN THAT GIRL'S FAVOR HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0034)
AND THEY COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0035)
I SURMISED THEN THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0036)
DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PRESENTED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0037)
I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MIGHT BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVORABLE WHAT CAN I DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0038)
THE CASE IS TOO DESPERATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0039)
WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SQUIBBLING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0040)
AGAIN JASPER HELD HIS WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0041)
AS FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0042)
WILLIAM COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0043)
SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE FIERCE BEATS OF HER HEART	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0044)
HE REMAINED ABRUPTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0045)
HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBSERVED THEN ADDED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0046)
THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLING IN THE BATTLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0047)
I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIANNE WHAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0048)
YOU ARE THE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0049)
MORE OF A BRUTE YOU THINK	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0050)
HE KNOW VERY WELL I DON'T	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0051)
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON HASTILY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0052)
AS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0053)
WILL YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR COUNSEL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0054)
YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHERS AT PRESENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0055)
I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH OF JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0056)
SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIS TOUCHINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0057)
BETTER I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0058)
HAS ONE THING OCCURRED TO HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0059)
WILL HE CONSENT TO ACCEPT AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0060)
AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHATEVER IS BEFORE HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0061)
SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND BREATHED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0062)
AS I HAVE SAID HERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU WERE MY WIFE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0063)
IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WELL WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0064)
ACCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER WAS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0065)
DO YE THINK EM INSURMOUNTABLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0066)
IT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0067)
I DON'T QUESTION MYSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0068)
SO SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILLINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0069)
PUT UP YOUR OWN UMBRELLA MARIAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0070)

WHY CAN YOU CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0073)
IS THAT THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUST YOURSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0074)
THEY MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARIAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0075)
HOW AM I TO SAVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0076)
I DO MEAN IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0077)
HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM AS HIS VOICE TREMBLED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0078)
THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER HIMSELF FOR HER PARENTS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0079)
YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADMIRE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0080)
IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR ME FATHER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0081)
GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL BEING I CAN'T STAND IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0082)
IT WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0083)
HE HAD MADE A PRETENSE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREES HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0084)
MOVING TO COVER HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0085)
FOR WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0086)
BUT SHE COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0087)
YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYONE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0088)
HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY THE FATE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0089)
IS IT IN THEIR POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0090)
BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I COULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0091)
IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I FEEL THAT I DID LOVE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0092)
WHATEVER CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0093)
REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDS PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0094)
SOON NOW YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0095)
WHAT CAN BE TRUER THAN THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0096)
IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS A COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0097)
MARIAN WOULD YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0098)
THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH HE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0099)
THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND AS IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0100)
JESPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0101)

THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0002)

AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD IN SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSE THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THIS IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEREFROM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0005)

ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KINNAEUS LIVED WITH OBSCERTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDIA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0007)
AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARDS HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDYA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0008)
WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FASCUS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0009)
WITH HIM THERE WENT THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0010)
ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE LARAMATAI	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0011)
HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR IT	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0012)
ADA'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0013)
AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KINGS IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0014)
HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD BRING THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0015)
IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE A MORTALS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0016)
AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR ME AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0017)
SHE ENTERED SOFTLY BUT SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0018)
SHE WAS A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0019)
KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF AYRIS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0020)
THEN I SOWED HER FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0021)
IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I MUST SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0022)
BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY FEET EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0023)
THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GARDEN	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0024)
I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS HOT AS IT IS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0025)
AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDEA GROW WIDE AND WITH FEAR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0026)
PHRONTIIS AND MELLUS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0027)
AND AS A MERCHANT APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0000)
EDWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0001)
THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THAT QUEST	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0002)
THEREAFTER ADMEADUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0003)
A HORRID FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0004)
BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOYS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0005)
WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID MEDMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0006)
BUT LITTLE APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0007)
HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT A CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0008)
ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT WAS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0009)
IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS AND MEDUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH TO YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0010)
IF I WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0011)
AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THAT COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0012)
THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARDS AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0013)
HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO AT DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0014)
BUT WHEN SHE SAW THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0015)
ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE HIS KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0016)
THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND IN THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0017)
ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KEEN AND HAVE MANY GOOD AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0018)
NOW THE FOOTSTEPS CEASED TO STOP	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0019)
IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0020)
AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BOUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0021)
DEATH WOULD SOON BE UP FOR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0022)
NO NOT HERE FOR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE COME INTO THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0023)
HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AS HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0024)
NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM IT	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0025)
AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN A CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0026)
TO WHAT GOD HAS THAT SACRIFICE DUE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0027)
AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT OTHER LABOR WAS BEFORE HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0028)
I HAVE DRAGGED IT FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0029)
WHY DID I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0030)
AND WHAT A NOBLE THE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0031)
HE LEFT THE PALACES OF ADMETUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0032)
YOU HAVE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0033)
AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE COULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0034)
SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0035)
HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I'M BRING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0036)
THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS FOR I HAVE HAD PAINS ENOUGH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0037)
THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN FROM THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0038)
HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK IF HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0000)
CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD WOMAN OF THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0001)
CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MT ZION	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0002)
I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE AND IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0003)
HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR A MAN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0004)
CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES HIS MEAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0005)
THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM WHICH WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MEN TO SWEEP IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0006)
CHRISTIAN WHAT WAS THIS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0007)
THAT YOU NEXT SAW A MAID COMING TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAID IT LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0008)
JUST AS CHRISTIAN WENT UP TO THE KRAUS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0009)
AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT NO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0010)
CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CRAFT BLESSED TOMB	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0011)
HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW TWO MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0012)
CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO HE GO	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0013)
FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZORIN FOR PRAISE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0014)
KNOW YOU ARE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0015)
HE TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0016)
YES SAID THEY NO DOUBTS OF IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0017)
AND IF WE ARE GETTING IN THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0018)
IS NOT OUR RACE AS GOOD AS YOURS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0019)
I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A PRISON	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0020)
NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN WENT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0021)
NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MUST REST THERE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0022)
TIMARA SAID THAT ZAYING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0023)
YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNOW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0024)
YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME EASE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0025)
HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0026)
SO HE WENT DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0027)
OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHIE HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0028)
SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SINS THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SLEEP	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0029)
FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0030)
NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BEACH HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0031)
WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAS GOT BACK HIS SCOW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0032)
HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREAST OF THE COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0033)
WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAMB THE HELL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0034)
O THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRINGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0035)
THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HOLD AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS MY STRENGTH SO SMALL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0036)
FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE BUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0037)
KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE BATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0038)
AND THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE WATCHFUL DWELT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0039)
CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE BE THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0040)
WHEN WATCHES TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0041)
AND CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITHIN TO THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0042)
HAIGTI COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0043)
CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL THEN I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0044)
PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MONTHIAC	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0045)
THERE I SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0046)
CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I KNOW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0047)
CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING HER WITH YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0048)
BUT THEY WOULD NOT GO WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0049)
THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG HIS HYMN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0050)
AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JOHN BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAIN AND THE STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLITH OF GATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0051)
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS HAND SAID CHRISTIAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0052)
THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANCHUS LAND	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0053)
MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW THIS JUDGE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0000)
JUDGE THOU JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0001)
THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE HIS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0002)
THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIGHT FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0003)
COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID CHRISTIAN LET US FALL ON THE GRASS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0004)
SO WE SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0005)
HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT TO THE RIGHT PATH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0006)
HOPEFUL SEE NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0007)
CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US WISH TO GO BACK	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0008)
THEY SAID DRY IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0009)
THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FORTS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0010)
AND BY THIS ACT WE CURE OUR HEARTS AS WELL	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0011)
OH WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0000)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP WITH THE ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0001)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DISMAYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECTED TO HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0002)
SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOW HAS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0003)
THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED OF A PROPERTY OF MEN AND OTHER ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0004)
NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAID AS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0005)
THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE GENERAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0006)
THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THE REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0007)
THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE WOULD GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0008)
SO ALL ANIMALS SHOULD HAVE A BIT MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0009)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE SAFE INNOCENCE MAN COULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0010)
MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATEMEN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0011)
THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEAN OVER PLANES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0012)
NOW IN MEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF THE MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0013)
I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STERILE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0014)
THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN GATHERED DISPARITY	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0015)
AND EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTS OF NATURE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0016)
OBJECTION IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0017)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE WOMEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0018)
IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THAT SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0019)
SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MEN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0020)
BUT IN HER STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0000)
ON THE CONTRARY EVERY THING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0001)
THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0002)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN UPON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0003)
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN A PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0000)
AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT THEY HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0001)
HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED LOUDLY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0002)
HIS CRUEL CREDITORS WERE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0003)
EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENCE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF THEM I SAID BITTERLY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0004)
I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAT A MAN CAN INFLICT UPON HER WHEN HE IS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0005)
SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH BUT STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0006)
HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO FREELY TO ME SHE ASKED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0007)
YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALWAYS YOURS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0008)
WHAT WRONG ARE YOU TALKING ON	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0009)
IS IT THIS WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0010)
DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNEASY OF YOU	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0011)
IT WAS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0012)
AND YOU TALKED OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0013)
IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD PRIDE SHE PLEADED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0014)
FOR SUCH A POSITION AS MINE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0015)
A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A DARK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0016)
AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD OR SHELTER	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0017)
AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF YOUR CHILD	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0018)
BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORESEEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0019)
MY ONLY FRIEND WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0020)
THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD WITH THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0021)
THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING HIM IN THAT WAY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0022)
I WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0023)
HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF THEM	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0024)
I YIELDED OR SPOKE OF IT NO MORE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0025)
EVERY WORD THEY UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0026)
AND BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0027)
I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I CRIED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0028)
LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN'	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0029)
IT IS SOMETHING TO HAVE YOUR ONLY FRIEND	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0030)
YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW WE CAN HELP YOU	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0031)
COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO DEATH	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0032)
TO MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0033)
A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED HOW DO YOU MEAN	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0034)
I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN IN MISTER VAN BRANDT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0035)
DOES SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I SAYS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0036)

NOTHING LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0039)
THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS KEEPING OUT OF PRISON	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0040)
YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE HAD OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0041)
UNHAPPILY HE HAD RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0042)
THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SENT FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0043)
IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN HE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0044)
WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT NO DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0045)
THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING IT LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0046)

AND YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN I REPLIED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0048)
I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER THIS PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0049)
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY FROM YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0050)
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HER SHE SAID SADLY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0051)
