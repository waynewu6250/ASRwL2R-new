IF YE WERE TO SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWERING TO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION	(116-288045-116-288045-0025)
I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN COMING TOWARDS HIM	(116-288045-116-288045-0026)
WILL HE NEVER BE HERE THIS MORNING	(116-288045-116-288045-0027)
WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPMERS I ASKED AGAIN	(116-288045-116-288045-0028)
WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASP HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLD LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS	(116-288045-116-288045-0029)

LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THIS EVIDENCE	(116-288047-116-288047-0021)
AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOURING HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY	(116-288047-116-288047-0022)

HERE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY	(116-288048-116-288048-0001)
WHY THAT DISCREPANCY IN THE HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION	(116-288048-116-288048-0002)
AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HOOD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH	(116-288048-116-288048-0003)
WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS AROUND JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES	(116-288048-116-288048-0004)
THAT IT IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR	(116-288048-116-288048-0005)
GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON LOWERS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAC AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON	(116-288048-116-288048-0006)

IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE NAMES OF JESUS	(116-288048-116-288048-0009)
THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS MYSELF	(116-288048-116-288048-0010)
HE WAS MATTHEW WHO WAS MARK	(116-288048-116-288048-0011)
HE WERE JOHN PETER JUDAS AND MARY	(116-288048-116-288048-0012)
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT WE EVER EXISTED	(116-288048-116-288048-0013)

HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW US	(116-288048-116-288048-0016)
PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGES ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY	(116-288048-116-288048-0017)
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF THEIR TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM	(116-288048-116-288048-0018)
COULD THEY HAVE BEEN CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM	(116-288048-116-288048-0019)
HOW ELSE HAS THIS UNANIMOUS SILENCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR	(116-288048-116-288048-0020)
HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONOURS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTE	(116-288048-116-288048-0021)

YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JUDAS MOUTHS	(116-288048-116-288048-0023)
ONLY A MYSTICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION	(116-288048-116-288048-0024)

HAVE ALL THESE PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED	(116-288048-116-288048-0026)
HOW MUCH SELF DELUDED PROFITS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED	(116-288048-116-288048-0027)
AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE CRIMES	(116-288048-116-288048-0028)

WOULD HE NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID	(116-288048-116-288048-0031)

IT WAS A NIGHT WHERE SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0000)
STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR MEDIA OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF A LEAF	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0001)
IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BELOW	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0002)

YOU'VE HEARD SOME	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0010)
I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF AFFAIRS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0011)
MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR OUR EXTRAVAGANCE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0012)
WAS THAT THIS AFTERNOON	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0013)
THERE ON THE NETS HE SAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0014)
JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO HIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0015)
NO I SHALL GO ON TO GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0016)
IT WAS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0017)
THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND SO	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0018)
THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ARGUMENTS TILL NOW	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0019)
HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WRIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0020)
HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT HE ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0021)
THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSIONS LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0022)
HE CAN SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0023)
I WILL TELL THE FRIEND TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0024)
HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS MUCH AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0025)
WITH THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0026)
WE ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PEARSON	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0027)
HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THIS WALK	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0028)
THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOME HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0029)
AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVIES CARRO	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0030)
SHE DRAWS CLOSE TO SATISFIES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0000)
HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE HAVEAN'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0001)
AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART FOR A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0002)
THAT THIS WAS NOT ALL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0003)
FOR WAS HE ABLE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0004)
IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY ADMITTED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0005)
HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON HER NEW INCARNATION	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0006)
SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LITTLE FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0007)
BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL PULLS SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0008)
RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK INTO HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0009)
JUST AS WE TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD HEIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0010)
SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ORNAMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0011)
YES I HAVE HAD MY HEALTH SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0012)
DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES OH THEN	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0013)
BUT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0014)
IT IS RATHER UNSCIVIL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0015)
AS A PUNISHMENT THEY DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0016)
I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANTECLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0017)
JOSCELYN PIERNE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0018)
ONLY DIDN'T HE MARRY HER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0019)
SAID MISSUS PINE AND WITH A START	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0020)
BUT JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY GIRL'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0021)
LADY ARRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMP LIGHT NICOLA PINE HAVING	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0022)
AND SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0023)
AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL THEY MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0024)
HE HAD NOT BEEN PERMITTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0025)
THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE IS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0026)
THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0027)
IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WANTED HIM TO FILL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0028)
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0000)
THE WAY OF THE INVENTORY IS HARD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0001)
HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT THE DISTRESS FOR COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0002)
WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OR MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGIES OR FORBID ITS VERY USE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0003)
POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING A HIGHER GOOD YET SOME CHECK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0004)
POSSIBLY THE LADDERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THEIR ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVETICISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0005)
ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN LESSENING FAST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0006)
YET THE VERY VOCAL OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0007)
A NUMBER OF PARENT ARCLINING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR THE STREET LINING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0008)
THUS IN THE CUREST MANNERS THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRED IN FACT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0009)
HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST HARDISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0010)
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY APPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SISTERS HAS DIED OUT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0011)
IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONGST THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES AND THE LEADING CITIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0012)
THE OTHER STRANGE OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0013)
THIS ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0014)
THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCLYTE BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0015)
HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN A MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0016)
THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HUNDREDS OF VISITORS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0017)
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS ACTIVITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0018)
SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY RISING OF WHICH THERE WERE PLENTY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0019)
BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA ARE NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0020)
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENIE'S INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0021)
WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AN ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM IN THE BALLASTON WATTGAGE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0022)
WE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS AND THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0023)
THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT ONTO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0024)
ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN I STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0025)
AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLUE HOW TO DO THAT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0026)
IT THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0027)
INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO ADDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING IN THE CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HAM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0028)
FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOEWORK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0029)
TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE THE PARADES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WORCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND OTHER DETAILS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0030)
IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLYLIGHT COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOWROOMS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0031)
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THIS CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS THE PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0032)
THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE A LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0033)
ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A MINE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0034)
BUT THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEE HIVE DAY AND NIGHT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0035)
THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARDNAACLET OF THE CLERK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0036)
I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK AND WOULD BREAK IT OPEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0037)
HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGR'S AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0038)
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND ON PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0039)
I THOUGHT NO MORE UPON THE MATTER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0040)
I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THIS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0041)
I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO A NOTICE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0042)
SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF KNIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMEE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0043)
HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING MY VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0044)
ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN AT ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0045)
AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AS NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0046)
ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIREWOOD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0047)
HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FAIR LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0048)
SPEAKING OF TELLS DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LINEN FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0049)
IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS THEWING FIRST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0050)
I HAD NOTHING TO PROTECT ME AGAINST A COAT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0051)
THEN I GOT PLEURACIA AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0052)
HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURES OF FACTING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0053)
NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION AS REQUIRED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0054)
LONDON IS COLD AND GLORY	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0000)

STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMN OF THE OLD STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAM STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHIONS AND UTTERED THE FOLLOWING ORRITORICAL FLIGHT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0002)
AND GLORIOUS LONDON	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0003)
SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WILD ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEATEN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0004)
THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR OUTING COUCHES	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0005)
WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERINGS AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE ENFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0006)
OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THE SUNSHINE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WERE GLOWING EXPECTATIONS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0007)
OFT EXPORTATION FOULTS AND MOST OFT THERE WHAR MOST E PROMISES AND OFT HE HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLITS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0008)
DESIS ONE DUBBLE WHEN SIX IS TREBACOY	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0009)
WILLEM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CENOPAT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0010)
THE POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE IT WORD FOR IT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0011)
I HAVE SET MY LIFE ON THE CASTE AND WILL WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0012)
I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BUW PAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0013)
IF HE HAD DROPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCATING	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0014)
THE PREENICE SHOP OF FOWL WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVERN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0015)
JAMES BURRIBRIDGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS PLOFF MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0016)
IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS THE IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0000)
THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH A PEOPLE OF THE WEST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0001)
THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT WE ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0002)
THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THIS IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE VAST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0003)
THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO THEIR COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0004)
HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS OWN RIGHT TO IT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0005)
HAVE THEY ACQUIRED A NEW LOVE OF FREEDOM	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0006)
THE GREAT EPOCH OF THE SOULS OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHABADA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0007)
WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY IS STIRRED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0008)
IT HEARTENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT CONSTRUCTION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0009)
THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ODOR WHICH FORMED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0010)
LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR VITAL AFFECTIONS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0011)

I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO BE APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0050)
THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HONOR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0051)
I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE BROUGHT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0052)

I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTILY FOR ROME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0054)
WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO THOUSAND OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0000)
TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I SHOULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0001)

WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS AND THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0004)

NOW ALAS BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY WIFE IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0006)
HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRY TO COMFORT HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0007)
THEN THE ROANN SAID TO THE BOATMAN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0008)
WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER SAILORS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0009)
THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONDANT HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0010)
WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONON OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WONDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0011)
FORTUNE FAVORING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM CHILD	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0012)
SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN WRONG I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0013)

AND HIDING ITS HEAD UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0017)

VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULTED IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0003)

OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHEN THE ROOM IS RAISED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0010)
THE HOUSEKEEPER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0011)
A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABOURERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGEPOLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCRAMBLED JOYFULLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0012)

FIRST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF TEA	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0023)
SO LONG AS THE COFFIN IS IN THE HOUSE IT MIGHT BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0024)

THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEARS THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0026)

SOMETIMES WITH A GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SET BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0033)

BY RUNNING ON THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO RAGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SUFFERING CONDITION ALMOST NAKED	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0007)
ALLEYNE MADE HIS TROUSERS HIMSELF AND THEN BUILT A RAFT ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MONTMOREY	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0008)
THERE AN INDIAN GAVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A BIG GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE BEARDSTOWN WHERE HE FOUND HIS SQUAW	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0009)
NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THAT PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GUARDDO	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0010)

PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTERS THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0010)
BUT THIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN HE SPOKE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0011)
A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S HANDS FLEW OPEN	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0012)
DONRLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0013)

AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE HIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USABLE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0016)

BILLY LAUGHED GAILY AND SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0024)
AND YOU EVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0025)
HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFTLY LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0026)
BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LAP INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT'S	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0027)

FIVE DAYS INDEED SINCE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0038)
I WONDER IF YOU THINK I CAN GET READY TO BE MARRIED IN SEVEN DAYS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0039)
WON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0040)

BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAND CRAFTILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0042)
THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES ARE NOT SLOW TO READ IT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0043)
SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GREAT ARM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0044)
BILLY MY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0045)
IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LOWER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0046)
WE MIGHT GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0047)
YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE OCTOBER THEN	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0048)
AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNCERTAINTLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0049)
YES SHOUTED BILLY DEMURELY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0050)
YES I KNOW THAT THAT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM MERRILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0051)
WE WANTED IT TO DAY BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0052)
YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING THE LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0000)
A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFIL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0001)
TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS STORY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0002)
BECAUSE IN HIS SUMMERED DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0003)
UNABLE TO THINK OF COURSE HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0004)
HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIANE WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0005)
HE READ TO MARIAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0006)
WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME SEE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0007)
I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BUFFIN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0008)
BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE COME ALL THE WAY OUT THERE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0009)
I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0010)
POVERTY YOU CAN ONLY SUPPOSE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0011)
BUT I WOULD SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFIN FOR A LONG TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0012)
WAS YOU STILL SO VERY POOR	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0013)
ASKED AMY COMPASSIONSATELY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0014)
I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0015)
NOW IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0016)
PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT FOOLISH LOVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0017)
HE SENT ME A COPY OF THE NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0018)
HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THESE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0019)
AMY I MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0020)
AND ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0021)
IS IT SO DANGEROUS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0022)
EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT WAS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0023)
OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0024)
HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FLOW DESPONDENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0025)
I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACCUSE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0026)
BUT THERE WAS SILENCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0027)
THE LAST SIX YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0028)
RECALLS WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0029)
JUST NOW I AM IN WANT OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0030)
YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF ON MY WORK RECENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0031)
DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THIS CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0032)
SOMETIMES I FEEL I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0033)
HER STORY OF THAT GIRL'S PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0034)
AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0035)
I SURMISE NOT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0036)
DON'T LOOK TO ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0037)
I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVORABLE WHAT COULD I DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0038)
A CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0039)
WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRIBLING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0040)
AGAIN JASPER HELD THIS WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0041)
YET BY SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0042)
MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TRAVEL ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0043)
SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE CONSCIOUS BEATS OF HER HEART	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0044)
HE BEGAN AGAIN ABRUPTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0045)
HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THAN ADDED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0046)
THERE WERE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THAT BATTLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0047)
I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF THE LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN WHAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0048)
YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT IN YOUR WAY JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0049)
MORE OF A BRUTE YOU SAY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0050)
WE KNOW VERY WELL I DON'T	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0051)
I HAVE MADE UP MY MINDS ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0052)
THESE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0053)
AND WILL YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0054)
YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR DAUGHTER AT PRESENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0055)
I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPERY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0056)
SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP ON HIM TOUCHINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0057)
WHY I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0058)
HAS ONE THING APPEARED TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0059)
WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A GIRL WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0060)
AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHY IS BEFORE HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0061)
WE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0062)
AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FOR YOU WHEN YOU WERE MY WIFE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0063)
IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIANNE AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0064)
EXCEPT JASPER AND IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0065)
DO YOU THINK THE INSURMOUNTABLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0066)
THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL BE THE PLAIN TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0067)
I DON'T TRUST IT MYSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0068)
BUT SHALL I FACE THEM WILLINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0069)

WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN HE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0071)
EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0072)
WHAT NEED YOU CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0073)
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU MISTRUST YOURSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0074)
WE SHALL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARIAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0075)
HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH AN UNCERTAINTY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0076)
I DO THINK IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0077)
HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM BUT HIS VOICE TREMBLED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0078)
THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING BEFORE HER PARENTS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0079)
YOU WHO KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0080)
IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY SON	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0081)
GOOD GOD THIS IS FEARFUL MARIAN I CAN'T STAND IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0082)
I' WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0083)
HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MADAME TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0084)
MOVING TO FOLLOW I SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0085)
ON WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0086)
BUT I COULDN'T SEE A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0087)
DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0088)
HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY RIGHT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0089)
IS IS IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0090)
BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE IT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0091)
IF I BELIEVE NOTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0092)
WHAT CAN YOU SAY OF ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0093)
REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT HE'S COME TO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0094)
SOON AFTER YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0095)
WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER FROM THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0096)
IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT GOD DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0097)
MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS THEN WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0098)
WHY THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0099)
THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0100)
JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY AND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0101)
ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM AGAIN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0102)
GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARIAN CAN'T WORK	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0103)
I MOST AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0104)

SO AM I DECLARED BEN VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0010)
MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND THEN ALL HANDS EVEN FREDDY AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0011)
THEY WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0012)
AND SO THE LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0013)
HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR TALK IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0000)
IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A STRINDBERG	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0001)
LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF LITERATURE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0002)
CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY A LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0003)
HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL BROTHER	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0004)
BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN PRESENCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICTS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0005)
EVEN THAT LOST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0006)
DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SIGN OF NEKHLUDOFF IN RESURRECTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0007)
THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE ATTIAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0008)
ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0009)
EVEN TO TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0010)
HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HANDS BUT WITH A SUCK	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0011)
BUT I HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0012)
HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF IN PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0013)
HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY AND A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0014)
THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ENNA CORENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0015)
WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT EXCEED THE CRIME	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0016)
HE IS GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSIONS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0017)
ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE THE ARTISTS AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0018)
HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES AND	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0019)
WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BURY THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0020)
AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE OLDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0021)
SERVE HIM RIGHT ANSWERED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0022)
IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KISS HIM	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0023)
IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0024)
NO MELODRAMATIST NEVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0025)
DOSTOEVSKY HAS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0026)
ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFFIEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEOKONSKI AGLAYA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VAYA FERUSHENKO NASTASIA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL YVOLGAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0027)
BUT THIS SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0028)
MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTIES AND ATTEMPTS THE DEFINITION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0029)
TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THAT STRUGGLE ITSELF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0030)
AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SERVANT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0031)
ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0032)
BECAUSE THEY ARE BELIEVED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0033)
THIS ARE ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0034)
TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRIT OR CONSENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0035)
THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CETERVOS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0036)
THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THAT MINE UNBELIEF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0037)
AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTAEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0038)
OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE MISSUS MISHKIN IN THE IDIOT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0039)
HIS WORK LIKE HIS LIFE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0040)
THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE DAY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0041)
AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUGUER DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0042)
WHEN HE BECAME SILENT ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0043)
AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CAUGHT THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0044)
THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF A MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0045)
IT IS A FIGURE IT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0046)
HE IS NEVER BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0000)
HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0001)
TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDYS IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0002)
HE DOES NOT EXPLAIN LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0003)
THUS HE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE THE ONE WHO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0004)
IT COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0005)
THAT PROSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0006)
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILE IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM ABOUT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0007)
WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE OUR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0008)
CATERING CHAIR IS AN APPALLING PHRASE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0009)
IS A LINE IN GOOD POETRY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0010)
YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGHER COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YE DID NOT COME	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0011)
THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUEL MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKES ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0012)
HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ANY BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0013)
ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO A FEW	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0014)
BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TORMENT THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0015)
HIS WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF PROPERTY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0016)
TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER AND THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0017)
TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED A SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0018)
FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD PLAINLY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0019)
BUT TIME TO MAKE ME FORGIVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0020)
AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDET'S POEMS THE OXEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0021)
WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STORY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING DOWN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0022)
THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF DEATH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOOD	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0023)
HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONIC DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0024)
HOW LONG HE COMES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0025)
WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORNED TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS THAT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0026)
BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION AS A SENIOR SOUL FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0027)
AND GENERAL HE WILL HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0028)
SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND HER NEW LOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0029)
AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DO THEY OF OUR DEEDS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0030)
MISTER HARDING HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0031)
THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ACTUAL HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0032)
IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDEE'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0033)
FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE ALWAYS RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0034)
HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS WROUGHT IN THE GRAVE DEFECTED OF THEIR GLORY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0035)
LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERE AND BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0036)
IN BEYOND THE LAST LAMPS WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0037)
NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL OUT TO YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0038)
BUT THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0039)
NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED EYES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0040)
IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER DIDN'T IT	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0000)
PENELOPE HAS STOOD SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE AULDER SISTER WISTFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0001)
DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THIS NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0002)
SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD HAVE ADMIRED IT FOR THE WORLD	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0003)
SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO TRY A NEW DRESS	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0004)

I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A QUICK	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0009)
IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT THIS IS ALL FADED NOW	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0010)
TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN OUR GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0011)
IT WAS SO KIND OF AUNT ADELA TO SEND IT SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0012)
WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS NEVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PENELOPE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0013)

IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSES AND HERE LOOM AFTER ALL	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0018)
PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY IN THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG IN THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS A POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0019)
SO PENELOPE CAME TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0020)
PENELOPE THOUGHT THE ALTOGETHER CHARMING	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0021)
SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAMES OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HERSELF	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0022)

WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT ROSE BUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN THABET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0026)
PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE TWO WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0027)
SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSES HOLD WAS BROKEN UP	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0028)
MY DEAR I AM A VERY LONELY YOUNG WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0029)
NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRBLE'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0030)
DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS CHANGED IN THE TWINNED CLING OF AN EYE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0031)
WHEN MISS FAIRWEATHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0032)
AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER FRIEND CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0000)

ALL HER DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM BEAUTIFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0005)
BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER HER BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0006)
THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MER BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SYDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0007)
HER BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THAT AVAILABLE SPACE	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0008)

AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARDS HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDEIA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0008)
WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE VASUS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0009)
TO HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0010)
ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF OUR BITTER FOES THE SARAMATAI	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0011)
WHO WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0012)
ADA'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON HIM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0013)
AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON ASKED	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0014)
HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE HIM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0015)
IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF A IMMORTALS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0016)
AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIALS OF YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0017)
SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE TWO WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0018)
SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT IS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0019)
KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ERIES YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0020)
THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER BRINGS BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0021)
IF WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0022)
BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY BODY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0023)
THUS JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0024)
I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS ABSURD AS IT IS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0025)
AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDEA GROW WILD AS WITH FEAR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0026)
PHRONTIS AND MELLOS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0027)
AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO THOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0000)
AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND ALWAYS RADIANT BEING	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0001)
THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THEIR COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0002)
THEREAFTER ADMETUUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0003)
A WRETCHED FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0004)
BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT CHEER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0005)
WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE OH APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIPS FOR ME SAID ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0006)
BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT CHOICE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0007)
HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0008)
ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON A BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0009)
IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS AD MEDIS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0010)
IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE FOR DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0011)
AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0012)
THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUSK OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0013)
HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH THAT	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0014)
BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CALLED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0015)
ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AN GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0016)
THEN ADMETUS WENT TO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0017)
ONE SHOULD GO INTO YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KEEN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0018)
WHILE THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0019)
IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HER AS BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0020)
AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE COULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0021)
DEATH WOULD STILL BE HERE FOR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0022)
NO NOT HERE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0023)
HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND WE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0024)
NO MORE SPEECH CAME UPON HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0025)
AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BEFORE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0026)
TO WHAT GOD IS THY SACRIFICE DUE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0027)
AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER WAY WAS BEFORE HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0028)
I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE SAID THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0029)
WHY SHOULD SHE NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0030)
AND WHAT A NOBLE THEORY IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0031)
HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AS HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0032)
YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET TO GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0033)
AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THAT TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0034)
SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0035)
HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO THE HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0036)
THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS AND I HAVE HAD PAINS ENOUGH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0037)
THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEILS OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0038)
HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSES AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0000)
CAPTAIN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0001)
CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT SCION	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0002)
I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GREAT THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0003)
HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FROM MAN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0004)
CHRISTIANA WHAT DOES THIS MEAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0005)
THEN HE TOOK IT TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0006)
CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0007)
THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COMING TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEMED MADE CLEAN AND LAID IT LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0008)
JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0009)
AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT ALONE THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0010)
CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CROSS BLESSED	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0011)
HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND ASLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0012)
CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YE AND WHERE DO YOU GO	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0013)
FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT DRYIN FOR PRAISE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0014)
KNOW YO NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0015)
THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THIS SCORE FOR LONG YOUTH HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0016)
YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF THIS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0017)
AND IF WERE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ARTS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0018)
IS NOT OUR CAUSE AS GOOD AS YOURS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0019)
I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THAT HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0020)
AND WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0021)
NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO COME BY MIGHT REST THERE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0022)
TIMARA SAID THAT TSUING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0023)
YES SAID MISTRUST FROM JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0024)
YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THAT MAN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0025)
HE FELT FOR HER BUT FOUND IT NOT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0026)
SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT OUT TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0027)
OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHIIL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0028)
SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS LETTER	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0029)
HOW FAR DO I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0030)
NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE FENCE HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0031)
WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAS GOT BACK THE SCROLL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0032)
HE HELD IT UP IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0033)
WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAMB THE WINDOW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0034)
AH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS RESTING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0035)
THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS OUR STRENGTH SO SMALL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0036)
FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE THEM AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0037)
KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATCH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0038)
THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE THEY WATCHFUL DWELT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0039)
CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE OF THIS MAY I REST HERE TONIGHT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0040)
WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0041)
THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT AWAY INTO THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0042)
HOTEE COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0043)
CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU MUST ASK IT OF ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0044)
PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MATTHIAM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0045)
THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE MY LORD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0046)
CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0047)
CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING ME WITH YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0048)
BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME TO ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0049)
THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN THE LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE WHERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0050)
AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JOHN BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAYING AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0051)
IT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0052)
THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN A MANUS LAND	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0053)
MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL IN YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0000)
JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US SEE WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0001)
THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KING'S SPOKE THIS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0002)
THUS WHILST ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0003)
COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID CHRISTIAN LET US TALK ON THE GRASS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0004)
SO THEY SET OFF TO THE FIELD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0005)
HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE WRONG PATH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0006)
HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS OUR GOOD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0007)
CHRISTIANS WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0008)
THEN SAID DRY IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IT IS MINE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0009)
THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FORS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0010)
AND WITH THIS ACT WE CURE OUR SOULS AS WELL	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0011)
FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OR MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0000)
THEREFORE IN HIS STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0001)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPEDE NOTHING DISMAYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0002)
SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0003)
THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROBABILITY OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0004)
NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAINTED IT IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0005)
WHEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0006)
THEY WILL NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0007)
THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD PUT THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0008)
SO ALL ANIMALS COULD HAVE A BIT MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0009)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THEIR SAFE INNOCENCE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0010)
MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABED MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0011)
THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAS NO DEMEANOUR OVER PLANS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0012)
NOW EMEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0013)
I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THAT PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNI HAVE BEEN STERILE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0014)
THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN POSITIVE DISPARITY	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0015)
AN EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE IN THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTS OF NATURE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0016)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THIS STATE OF INNOCENCE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0017)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE GOD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0018)
IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0019)
SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN FOR TWO REASONS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0020)
BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0000)
ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS AT FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0001)
THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY POWER	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0002)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORNE ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS OF GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0003)
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDY IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0000)
AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT ME HELPLESS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0001)
HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH ME WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0002)
HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FROM THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0003)
EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENCE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY TO HIM I SAID BITTERLY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0004)

THAT WRONG ARE YOU TALKING OF	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0009)
IS NOT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0010)
DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY YOU	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0011)

AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND MOTHER I SAID	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0013)
IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS HIS CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0014)
IN SUCH A POSITION IS MINE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0015)

HAD I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD AND SHELTER	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0017)
AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BOUNDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0018)
BAD AS IT IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0019)
MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE THEIR WIFE	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0020)
THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO SHOULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0021)
THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THESE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0022)
