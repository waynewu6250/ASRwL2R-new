MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT PRESENTLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0012)
IT WAS THAT THIS EVENING	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0013)
THERE AT THE NETS THEY SAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0014)
JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0015)
NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACHED IT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0016)
IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WONT CARE TO STAY	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0017)
THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND WELL	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0018)
THEY HAD NOT NOTICED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0019)
HE STEADIED HER RAPIDLY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0020)
HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT HE ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0021)
THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHTS OF THE PASSAGE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0022)
HE COULD SEE NOW THAT SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0023)
I WILL CALL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0024)
HE SEEMED RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0025)
BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM A CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0026)
YOU ARE SLEEPING MY GIRL SAID PEARSON	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0027)
HE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0028)
THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING OUT HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0029)
AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE ABBES CARRIE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0030)
SHE DRAWS CLOSELY AND SATISFIES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0000)
HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PENAVAN'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0001)
AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART A WHILE IN A DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0002)
WAS NOT ALL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0003)
BUT WAS I ABLE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0004)
IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO THITHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0005)
HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THEIR NEW INCARNATION	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0006)
SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPDENSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0007)
BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELLS SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0008)
RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN THE CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0009)
JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD HELL HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0010)
SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEHOW IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0011)
YES I HAD HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0012)
DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES OH NO	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0013)
WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE OBSERVED IN SURPRISE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0014)
IT IT IS RATHER UNCIVIL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0015)
AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THAT BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0016)
I SAW HIM AT LADY CHARNELCLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0017)
JOSCELYN PIERTION	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0018)
BUT DIDN'T HE MARRY HER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0019)
SAID MISSUS PINEAKAN WITH A START	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0020)
BUT JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE GREAT WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0021)
LADY ARRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICOLA PINE HAVEN	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0022)
SHE HAD BEEN THE NEXT ARRIVAL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0023)
AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF BY THE EATING AND DRINKING	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0024)
HE HAD NOT BEEN ACQUAINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0025)
THE RING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0026)
THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THIS TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0027)
IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISH HIM TO FILL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0028)
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF A STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0000)
THAT WAY OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0001)
HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESS FOR COSTS OF PERSONAL SURRENDER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0002)
WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN WAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGES OR FORBID ITS VERY USE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0003)
POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD YET SOME CHECK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0004)
POSSIBLY THE LATTER WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0005)
ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN RIPENING FAST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0006)
YES THE VERY VOGUEAL OF THE ELECTRIC ARTLIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0007)
A NUMBER OF PARENT ARCLIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR STREET LINING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0008)
THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDING FOUND WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0009)
HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADAMISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0010)
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY APPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMICAL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0011)
IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES OF THE LEADING CITIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0012)
THE OTHER SMALL OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0013)
THERE ALSO THE MOST PURE FEELING WAS SHOWN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0014)
THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCLITE BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0015)
THERE AGAIN IS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0016)
THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HUNDREDS OF SITTERS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0017)
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLES OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0018)
SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE ARE PLENTY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0019)
BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA HAS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0020)
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE THE GENIE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0021)
WE GOT IT AT THE GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM IN THE BALLASTON WATTGAGE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0022)
IT SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0023)
THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0024)
ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED SOME OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0025)
AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME YEARS I GOT A CLUE HOW TO DO IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0026)
I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID HER WORK NICELY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0027)
INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO ADDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING IN A CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HAM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0028)
FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOWORK STREETS NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0029)
TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE PARADES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON OORCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMEROUS OTHER DETAILS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0030)
IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTRO LIGHT COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0031)
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS THE PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF A FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0032)
THE EXPERIENCE WITH A LITTLE GAS ENGINES WAS RATHER STARTLING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0033)
ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A ROT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0034)
FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY FOUR WAS A VERITABLE BEE HIVE DAY AND NIGHT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0035)
THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARDERNACLET OF THE CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0036)
I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK OPEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0037)
HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGURS AND WHO WOULD SHOW HIM A TRICK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0038)
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND OTHER PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0039)
I HAD THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0040)
I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT HIM	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0041)
I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO DENOTE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0042)
SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF KNIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMONI	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0043)
HE DID TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0044)
ONE NIGHT WHO CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0045)
AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALLED AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0046)
ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF A LONDON FIRE BRIGADE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0047)
HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE TREES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0048)
SPEAKING OF TELL US DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN'S STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAND FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0049)
IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS TOWING FIRST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0050)
I HAVE NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST A COAT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0051)
THEN HE GOT PLEURACY AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0052)
HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF PAINING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0053)
NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATIONS WAS REQUIRED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0054)
LONDON ITS GOAT AND GLORY	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0000)

GLORIOUS WONDER	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0003)
SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS FINE ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEATEN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0004)
THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWN IN COUCHES	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0005)
WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERING AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TINY BODIES LAY IN THE ENFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0006)
OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THE SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD BUT GLOWING EXPECTATIONS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0007)
OFT EXPORTATION FOULTS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST HE PROMISES AND OFT IT HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLITS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0008)

THE POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKES A WORD FOR IT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0011)
I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON THE CAST AND WOULD WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0012)

IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUTWARD FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0000)
THAT SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0001)
THEY ARE FLATTERED IN BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0002)
THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE MASS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0003)
THE MENTALITY AS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0004)
HE WHO CARES TO BE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0005)

WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS STIRRED AND OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0008)
IT HARDENED INTO THE AGE OF INERT CONSTRUCTION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0009)
THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO THE CONVENTIONAL ODOR WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0010)
LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH ALL VITAL FUNCTIONS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0011)

OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WOULD NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OR OF MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAS GONE	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0020)
IT WAS A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED LIRA ONE HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS HA	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0021)
HE WAS MUCH PASSED IN A GREAT HURRY	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0022)
DIRECTLY HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED THE DEVILS	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0023)

THERE WERE STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE OPONENTS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0005)
ONE OF THE MOST DISTINCT WAS THE GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATES SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR SMOKING AMONG OFFICERS OF THE ARMY	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0006)

THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT THE PRINCE MAJOR APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0000)
SEAS WERE BROUGHT IN AND SO WAS THE TEA	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0001)

SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AS THE PHYSICIANS KNOW NOTHING	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0011)
THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER SAYING IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MURDERED UPON THE SPOT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0012)
THEREFORE HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0013)
I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I WAS ENTIRELY QUENCHED MY THIRST	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0014)
IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED ME TO BLEED HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0015)
IF HE KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0016)
YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF THE CURE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0017)
AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHEWED HIS FACE AGAIN	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0018)
THAT VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM A COLD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0019)
DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME WITH ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0020)
THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO BRING ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0021)

THERE THEY SEATED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUCK WENT BY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0027)
MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN HAVE VISITED THE DUKE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0028)
AT THESE WORDS MAESTRO AGOSTINO THE DUKE'S TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHOULD KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0029)

GEORGIN MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0035)
THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS MAJESTY AND HE HALTED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0036)
THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MARVELLED THAT I WAS STILL ALIVE AFTERWARDS HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0037)
WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTE AR GUTTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0038)

YOU WANTED THEM TO IMMORTALIZE THAT FEROCIOUS TYRANT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0042)
YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0043)
IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENTE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0044)
MESSAR FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DYES FOR THAT MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0045)
I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT HE WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0046)
I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENZENO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0047)
NICCOLO DA MONTE GUTTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENCIO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0048)
NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HAND AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0049)
I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVENGE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0050)
THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT MERIT HE HAD GAINED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0051)
I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECES READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH THE SINGLE BALL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0052)
I NEVER SEEMED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0053)
I LEFT MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0054)
WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I PROMISE TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0000)
TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSES	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0001)
BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADES THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF KOANA	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0002)
HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED ON FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0003)
WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT CAN BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0004)
WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RONIN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPEN TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0005)
NOW ALICE BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0006)
HE SPOKE SO FAMILIARLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0007)
THEN THE ROANANT SAID TO THE BOATMAN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0008)
WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER PROFESSORS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0009)
THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE ROANS HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0010)
WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONON OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTA	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0011)
FORTUNE FAVORING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WOMAN WHO BORE HIM A CHILD	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0012)
SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOT THIEF	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0013)
HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHOSTINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0014)

NOW IT CHANCED THAT THEIR STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0016)
AND HIDING HIS FOOT UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0017)
THREE YEARS AGO AT THE CUANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBERED IT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0018)
HAPLY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNT TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0019)
ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE LEARNED OF YOUR MARVELLOUS AILMENT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0020)
THINKING I COULD DIVINE YOUR CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0021)
AND HAD IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALICE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0022)

VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULTS IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0003)

OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHEN THE GROUP IS RAISED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0010)
THE HOUSE OWNNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0011)
A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABOURERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGE POLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SCRAMBLED JOYFULLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0012)

LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFINS ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF TEA	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0023)
SO LONG AS THE COFFIN IS IN A HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0024)

THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO PROMPTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0026)

SOMETIMES WITH THE GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN HIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0033)
ANOTHER FAVOURITE PEASANT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0034)

YES I KNOW THAT WAS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM MERRILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0051)
WE WANTED IT TO MORROW AND WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0052)
YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM RICH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0000)
A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST FULFILL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0001)
TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WILL MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0002)
BECAUSE IN HIS SAILORED DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0003)

OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0016)
PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS HOPE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0017)
HE SEND ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0018)
HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0019)
AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT MEN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0020)
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT OUR FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0021)
IS IT SO MYSTERIOUS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0022)
EVEN IF MISTER YULL RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0023)

SOMEHOW I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0033)
HER STORY ON THAT GIRL'S PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0034)
THAT I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0035)
I SURMISE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELVES WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0036)
DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE CONTINUED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0037)

WELL I'LL GO BACK TO YOUR SCRIBBLING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0040)
AGAIN JASPER BEHELD THE WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0041)
YET OF SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0042)
VIRGINIA COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0043)
SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE HAD APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER HEART	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0044)

STILL I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0058)
AS ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0059)
WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A LADY WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0060)
AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES IT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0061)
SHE LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND REFLECTED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0062)
AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU WERE YOUR WIFE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0063)
IT ISN'T MY FAULT MARIAN AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0064)
ACCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS CARELESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0065)

SURE ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0095)
WHAT CANNOT BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0096)

SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES PROPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0001)
THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT IN EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0002)

AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY UPON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0005)
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTER HOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0006)

MUST IT NECESSARILY EXIST	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0003)
WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONSTITUTING AND THEREFORE AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0004)
AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD IN SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSE THAT THOUGHT BEING TAKEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEREFROM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0005)

COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN SCHOLASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS ECCENDI RERAM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0007)
COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD NOR MODES BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0008)

THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOW THIS FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE	(5849-50873-5849-50873-0025)

MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FRED AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0011)
THERE ARE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0012)
AND SO OUR OLD FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0013)
HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL AND EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0000)
IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD THIS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0001)
LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF TORTURES	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0002)
CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS ON DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0003)
YOU MAY NOT BE A CRUEL AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0004)
BUT THEY WERE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0005)
EVEN THE LOST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LOSS OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0006)
DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SCENE OF NEKHLUDOFF AT RESURRECTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0007)
THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE IDIAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0008)
ONE RESULT OF THIS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0009)
EVEN OUR TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0010)
HE SAW HIS FINAL DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SUCK	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0011)
BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH UPON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0012)
HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED THEM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0013)
HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY ONE HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0014)
THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ENNA CORENNINA OR FATHERS AND SONS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0015)
WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT PRECEDE THE CRIME	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0016)
HE IS GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY OF PASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0017)
ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST OR AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0018)
HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS PREVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0019)
WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BARING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0020)
AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PATRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0021)
SERVE HIM RIGHT SAID DMITRI BREATHLESSLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0022)
IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL GO AGAIN AND KILL HIM	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0023)
IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY IS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0024)
NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE WITH SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0025)
DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW ALL IN AT ONCE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0026)
ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFFIEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEWKONSKI AGLEA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VAYA FERUSHENKO NASTASYA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL YVOLGAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0027)
BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS OR CHARACTERS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0028)
MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THIS DEFINITION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0029)
TO HIM DOSTAEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0030)
AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN THE SURROUNDING DARKNESS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0031)
ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE AND OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0032)
BECAUSE THEY ARE POSSESSED AND ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0033)
THIS IS ALL IN THE MEASURE TRUE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0034)
TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITICAL CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0035)
THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CETIVOS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0036)
THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S GOD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0037)
AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHTS OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0038)
OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE MISS MISHKIN IN THE IDIOT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0039)
HIS WALK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0040)
THE NOBLES ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0041)
AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUDAIS DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0042)
WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT HE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0043)
AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED A LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0044)
THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVEL	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0045)
IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS IT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0046)
HE HAS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0000)
HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MIDNIGHT AND STORM	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0001)
TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDLEY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0002)
HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LOVE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0003)
THUS HE WRITES IN I FOUND THE OUT THERE OF ONE WHO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0004)
THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THIS IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0005)
AND POSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0006)
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE POEM ABOUT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0007)
WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THE CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0008)
HATERING CARE IS AN APPALLING PHRASE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0009)
IS A KIND OF GOOD POETRY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0010)
YE DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0011)
THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUAL MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKES ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0012)
HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN OR PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0013)
ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDEE TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0014)
BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TROUBLE THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0015)
YOUR WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0016)
TO BE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0017)
TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR WAS IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0018)
FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWING COLD TO ME COULD LONG WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0019)
BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRAVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0020)
AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDES'S POEMS THE OXEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0021)
WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR DREARY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0022)
THE MOOD OF FATE HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOOD	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0023)
HE CANNOT ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0024)
HOW LONG HE ASKED IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0025)
WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GOD LIKE SCORN TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEA	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0026)
BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION A SENIOR SOUL OF FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0027)
AND GENERAL HELL HOLD OUT THEIR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0028)
SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM NEW LOVERS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0029)
AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DWELL THERE ON OUR DEEDS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0030)
MISTER HARDY HAS TOO VIGOROUS A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0031)
THE REAL WORLD OF MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0032)
IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDIES'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0033)
FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE NEVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0034)
HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS WROUGHT IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED THEIR GLORY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0035)
AND LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0036)
ON BEYOND THE LAST LAMP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0037)
NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON TO YOUR'S ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0038)
THEY BRINGS US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0039)
NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS WAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0040)
IT'S A SAD THING FOR THE BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T IT	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0000)
PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE AUDER SISTER WISTFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0001)
DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT EM ALL THE NEXT DAY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0002)
SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ATTRIBUTED IT FOR THE WORLD	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0003)
SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO SET A NEW DRESS	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0004)
DORIS HUNTER I BELIEVE IT'S A OLD QUILT	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0005)
LISTEN PENELOPE MY DEAREST DORIS	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0006)
LOVE TO PENELOP AND HERSELF	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0007)
YOUR AFFECTIONATE MISS ADELA HUNTER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0008)
I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A QUEER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0009)
HE MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL FADED NOW	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0010)
TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER THE HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0011)
IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELA TO SEND THAT SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0012)
WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT DECLARED PENELOPE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0013)
WHAT LOVELY OLD DIMY STUFF AND NOT A BIT FAT	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0014)
I DECLARE IT IS AS GOOD AS A NEW	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0015)
WELL LET US GO AND HAVE CHEAT SAID PENELOPE I'LL DECIDEDLY HUNGRY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0016)
BESIDES I SEE THE POVERTY BLOCKER COMING	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0017)
IT'S SOMETHING TO POSSES AND HEIRLOOM AFTER ALL	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0018)
PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HURT COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY IN THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS THE POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0019)
SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCH'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0020)
PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0021)
SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAYS TO HERSELF	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0022)
MY AUNT ADELA GAVE ME GAVE US THEIR MATERIALS SHE STAMMERED	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0023)
I'M NAMED AFTER HER MISSUS FAIRWATER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER BEAUTIFUL OLD FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND TENDERNESS	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0024)
NOW YOU ARE MY GRAND NIECE SHE SAID	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0025)
WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT ROSE BUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN THABET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0026)
PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHERS	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0027)
SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSEHOLD WAS BROKEN UP	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0028)
MY DEAR I IS A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0029)
NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRLANDER'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0030)
DORIS AND PANELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS CHANGED IN THE TWINED CLING OF AN EYE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0031)
WHEN MISSUS FAIRWESTER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0032)
AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS THE AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0000)
AUNT JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND THE YEAR OLD BABY CLINGING TO THE OTHER	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0001)
SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND VULGAR AS A SUNFLOWER WAS AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASION	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0002)
I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BIGGSBY IS THIS MORNING SIDDY AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0003)
SYDNEY SIGHED AND WENT DOWN STAIRS TO THE BABY	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0004)
ALL HER DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED HIM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0005)
BUT SHE WOULD RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0006)
THE ROOM WAS SMALL A SQUARE BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SYDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0007)
HIS BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0008)
JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A PENNY AND THE MOUTH ZIG ZAGGED FROM EAR TO EAR	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0009)
SYDNEY HATED THAT MARRIAGE AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD HATE ANYTHING	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0010)
HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SYDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THIS DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0011)
PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO WRITE WITH A FLUSH OF RED EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0012)
ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO ELLEN DOUGLAS AND THAT WAS FORWARDED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFFERING EDITOR OF THAT MAPLE LEAF	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0013)

EDA'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0013)
AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE MASON SAID	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0014)
HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TROUBLE HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0015)
IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE MORALS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0016)
AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO WEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0017)
SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE DREW AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0018)
SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY LARGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0019)
KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ERAS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0020)
THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED WHICH DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0021)
IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU TO GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0022)
AND IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0023)
THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS FACE UPON THE GROUND	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0024)
I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS GLAD AS IT IS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0025)
AS HE SAID THAT HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDIA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0026)
PHRONTIS AND MES WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0027)
AND SO A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0000)
AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEINGS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0001)
THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON A ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0002)
THEREAFTER ADMESTUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0003)
A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT IT WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0004)
BUT APOLLO TURNING TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0005)
WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAYS ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0006)
BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH THE FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0007)
HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE IS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0008)
ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK AT THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0009)
IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS AND MEDEUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0010)
IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE TO DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0011)
AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT MAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0012)
HERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0013)
HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE QUEEN AND GO WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0014)
BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME ON THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0015)
ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THAT KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0016)
THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE THIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0017)
ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE YOUNG AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0018)
NO THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0019)
IT WAS NOT SO CHEERFUL FOR HIM AS BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0020)
OF THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0021)
DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE OF HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0022)
NO NOT HERE FOR YE WOULD NOT HAVE COME INTO THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0023)
HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0024)
NO MORE SPEECH FROM HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0025)
AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN HIS CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0026)
TO WHAT GOOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DUE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0027)
AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER PRAYER WAS BEFORE HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0028)
I ARE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0029)
WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH FAITH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0030)
AND WHAT A NOBLE THEIN IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0031)
HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GOD	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0032)
YOU ARE HELD BY ME YET AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0033)
AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD THEM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0034)
SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FINGERS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0035)
HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I'M BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0036)
THIS I WILL NOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PAINS ENOUGH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0037)
THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0038)
HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO A HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0000)
CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MEN OF THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0001)
CHRISTIAN SIRE I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0002)
I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN AS STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0003)
HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR IT AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0004)
CHRISTIAN WHAT DO THIS MEAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0005)
THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND THE INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MEN TO SWEEP IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0006)
CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS HIS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0007)
AND YOU NEXT SAW A MAID COMING TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0008)
JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAUSE HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0009)
AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT WOMANS CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0010)
CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT OH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CROSS BLESSED TOMB	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0011)
HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE COME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0012)
CHRISTIAN SIRS WHITHER COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0013)
FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZUIN FOR PRAISE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0014)
KNOW YE'RE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0015)
THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THEIR SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0016)
YES SAID THAT NO DOUBT OF IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0017)
AND IF WE'RE GETTING TO THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0018)
IS NOT YOUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0019)
I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE WAS A SPRING	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0020)
NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT TO THE HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0021)
NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A GRAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0022)
TIMARA SAID THAT TSAYING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0023)
YES SAYS MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0024)
YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PIECE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0025)
THEY FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0026)
SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS COW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0027)
OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHILI HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0028)
SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS DEATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0029)
HOW FAR WILL I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0030)
NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT INTO HIS CLOAK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0031)
WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAS GOT BACK HIS SCRAW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0032)
HE LOCKED IT UP IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0033)
WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAMB THE GATE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0034)
AH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRINGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHALL I FLY FROM THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0035)
THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE OUT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0036)
FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH DONE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0037)
KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM WILL COME TO THEE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0038)
THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE IT WATCHFUL DWELT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0039)
CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO DAY	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0040)
WHEN WASHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0041)
THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT OVER TO THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0042)
HIGHEE COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0043)
CHRISTIANS WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0044)
PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MONTHIAHEN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0045)
THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THEIR LORD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0046)
CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0047)
CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING WITH YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0048)
BUT THEY WILL NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0049)
THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THEN HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0050)
AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE GIANT BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAIN AND THE STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0051)
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAST SAID CHRISTIAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0052)
THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MAN'S LAND	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0053)
MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HURT TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0000)
JUDGE MY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0001)
THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THEN YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0002)
THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRIST	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0003)
COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GROUND	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0004)
SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH FIELDS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0005)
HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THAT RIGHT PATH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0006)
HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR MY GOOD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0007)
CHRISTIAN WE MUST THEN STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0008)
AND SAID DRY IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0009)
THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FORNED	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0010)
BUT BY THIS ACT WE CURE OUR SOULS AS WELL	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0011)
FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0000)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THESE ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0001)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DISOBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0002)
SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF A DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWEVER GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0003)
THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PRODUCT OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0004)
NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS MADE IT IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0005)
THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMAL TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0006)
THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THAT ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0007)
THIS WAS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0008)
SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A GREAT MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0009)
OBJECT ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE SAFE INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0010)
MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATE MEN IN THIS STATE OF INNOCENCE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0011)
THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEANIN OVER PLANS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0012)
NOW HIM MEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0013)
I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS ON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNI HAVE BEEN STERILE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0014)
THERE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0015)
AN EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE IN THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0016)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN HIS STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0017)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0018)
IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING THREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0019)
SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THAT STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MEN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0020)
