IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND THE HISTORIANS OF THIS TIME DID NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM	(116-288048-116-288048-0018)
SHOULD THEY HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM	(116-288048-116-288048-0019)

STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR METEIA OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAVES	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0001)

HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE GLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0023)
I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO TAKE THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0024)

BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH THE DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0026)
YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PEARSTONE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0027)

BUT THIS WAS NOT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0003)
BUT WAS YOU ABLE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0004)
IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH OTHERWISE SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0005)
HE DETERMINED TO DRAW IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0006)
SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM HER LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0007)
BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POOL SEEMED COLD THOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0008)
RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0009)

SHE HAD SEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0023)
AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED IN A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0024)
HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM AND AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0025)
TO SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0026)
THE LADY ON JOSCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF THE LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0027)
IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POSTS IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0028)
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THEIR EVENTS CAN BE SEEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0000)
THE WAYS OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0001)
HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST OR PERSONAL SURRENDER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0002)
WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APAREGIS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0003)
POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVEALED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING A HIGHER GOOD AND IT SOME CHECK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0004)
POSSIBLY THE LADDERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVETICISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0005)
ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS OF ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN RIGHTENING FAST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0006)
YES THE VERY VOGUAL OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF INCANDESCENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0007)
A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LINEING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR THE STREET LINING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0008)
THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND ACCORDING FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCES WAS INEVITABLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0009)
HENCE THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0010)
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMAL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS THE SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0011)
IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES AND THEIR LEADING CITIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0012)
THE OTHER STRONGLY OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0013)
THERE ALSO THIS MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0014)
THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCOLDE BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0015)
HERE AGAIN IS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ANIMALS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0016)
THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY THE HUNDREDS OF CITIZENS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0017)
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST WAS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0018)
SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THEY WERE PLENTY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0019)
BUT IT MIGHT BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0020)
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE JANIE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0021)
WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM IN THE BALASTON WATTAGE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0022)
WAS SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0023)
THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0024)
ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN YOU STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0025)
AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I HAD A CLUE HOW TO DO IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0026)
I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NEATLY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0027)
INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO ADDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING IN THE CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0028)
FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GORWORTH STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0029)
TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE PARADES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON OORCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMBERLESS OTHER DETAILS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0030)
IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTE COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0031)
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN A CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS THE PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0032)
THE EXPERIENCES WITH THE LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0033)
ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A ROUND	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0034)
FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEAR SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEEHIVE DAY AND NIGHT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0035)
THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARDONAIS OF THE CLERK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0036)
I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM OFF IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0037)
HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEGRS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0038)
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND OR PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0039)
I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT A MATTER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0040)
I DIDN'T REMEMBER ABOUT IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0041)

HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING A VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0044)
ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH THE VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0045)

IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS ALLING FIRST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0050)
I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THAT COAT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0051)
THEN THEY GOT PLEURACINE AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0052)
HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF CATCHING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0053)

WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERING AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE INFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHEUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0006)

THIS POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE A WORD FOR IT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0011)
I HAVE SENT MY LIFE UPON THE CASTE AND WOULD WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0012)

IN MY RECENT TRAVELS ON THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0000)
THE SAME THING HAS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0001)
THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0002)
THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE WORLD	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0003)
THE PRINCIPALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0004)
HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FROM OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0005)

IT HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT CONTRADICTION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0009)
THE ORGANIC UNITY OF HER VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ODOR WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0010)
LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND IS IN HARMONY WITH OUR VITAL FUNCTIONS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0011)

JUST THEN THE OTHER MISTER BERNARDINO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAD REFUSED TO BLEED ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0009)
MAESTRO FRANCESCO THAT MOST AMIABLE MAN EXCLAIMED OH POWER OF NATURE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0010)
HE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE PHYSICIANS KNOW NOTHING	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0011)
THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER SAID IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED UPON THE SPOT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0012)
AFTERWARDS THEY TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0013)
I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED YOUR THIRST	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0014)
IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THAT POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED HER TO BLEED HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0015)
IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DIDN YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0016)
YOU COULD THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HIS CURE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0017)
AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUAKER SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0018)
THAT VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREATER PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0019)
DO NOT COMMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME IN ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0020)
THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO IS PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0021)
SO I HAD MADE MY MIND UP AND PREPARED TO TRAVEL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0022)
THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIERRE LANDES WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0023)
NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUT WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0024)
I HAD HARBOURED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN BUT THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0025)
MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DE MONTEVERQUI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0026)
THERE THEY CENTRED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0027)
MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED ON THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0028)
AT THESE WORDS MAESTRO AGOSTINO THE DUKE'S TAILOR MADE HIS WAY TO ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0029)
GEORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MYASTHRO AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED THERE IS THAT MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NOT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0030)
AS FIERCELY AS I COULD BUT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED GIORGIO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0031)
HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO AND THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THIS SWORD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0032)
MAESTRO AUGUSTINO RETORTED YOU GALLOWS SPIRIT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0033)
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT FROM MOST CERTAIN	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0034)
GEORGIUS MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0035)
THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND WE HALTED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0036)
THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MARVELLED I WAS STILL ALIVE OTHERWISE HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0037)
WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTERA GUTTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0038)
I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND TOLD HIM ALL THE AFFAIR ABOUT THE PINT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0039)
HE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE THEIR VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0040)

DO YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALIZE THAT FEROCIOUS TYRANT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0042)
YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOES AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0043)
IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENTS	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0044)
MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DYES OF THAT MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0045)
I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WILL TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0046)
I THEN SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENCIO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0047)
NICCOLO DA MONTERE GUTTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENCHINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0048)
NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAVE FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0049)
I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORTH TO MY BEST ABILITY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0050)
THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOR THEY USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0051)
I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND IN A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0052)
I NOW USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0053)
I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR GAME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0054)
WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIRE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0000)
TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I SHOULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0001)
BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADE'S THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF CUANA	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0002)
HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THOSE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0003)
WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM A DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0004)
WHEN HE SAW THIS THE ROAN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE IS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPEN TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0005)
NOW ALAS IN THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0006)
HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT THEM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0007)
THEN THAT ROANON SAID TO THE BOATMAN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0008)
WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAITORS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0009)
THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONDA HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0010)
WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONON OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOSTO	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0011)
FORTUNE FAVORING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED THE WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0012)
SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME IT HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0013)
HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN COULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0014)
AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TOKOBAY FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERY MISERY THE WONDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0015)
HOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0016)
AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THEIR COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0017)
THREE YEARS AGO AT THE CUANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL REMEMBER IT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0018)
HAPLY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WALKING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0019)
ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF MY MARVELLOUS AILMENT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0020)
THINKING I COULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND THAT I WAS NOT MISTAKEN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0021)
AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME HIM TO BEAR MALICE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0022)
REPENT NOT THEREFORE AND ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAYS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0023)
TO SEE YOU DIE SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0024)
BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU SHALL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TORMENT YOU	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0025)
IN A FIT OF MADNESS HE WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROB YOU	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0026)
FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOMEDAY OVERTAKE ME	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0027)
HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD HER SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0028)
BUT HOW YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND ARE ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0029)
A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WINDS OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0030)
EVERY WELL ORDERED JAPANESE HOME OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTER OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THAT HOUSE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0000)
SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY OR ANNIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0001)
THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHERS AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0002)
VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT ON ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0003)
ALL THESE WERE PUT TOGETHER BY THE POWERFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT THE CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SON	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0004)
AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES FALL OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0005)
EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILLED BALANCER OF PROSE AND KHANS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0006)
FOR THE GREATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE THE HOME PROPHECIES ARE THOUGHT TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN AND THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED IN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0007)
NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHICH DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0008)
AFTER THIS MANNER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE AS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0009)
OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS THE DAY WHEN THE ROOF IS RAISED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0010)
THE HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY A BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0011)
A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABOURERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGEPOLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SCRAMBLED JOYFULLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0012)
ALL COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CANNOT COME SEND THEIR SERVANTS OR PROVISIONS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0013)
ON THE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN A CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS A STILL COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0014)
NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES THAT SURVIVAL OF AN OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0015)
AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE AT THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0016)
THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES WHICH ATTEND THE FUNERAL	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0017)
UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL THOSE LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0018)
WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IT IS DRESSED IN WHITE AND SILK HABA TIE WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0019)
THE BODY TOO BEING PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0020)
THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THAT COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THAT THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0021)
THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METHOD IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEED THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0022)
LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF CHEESE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0023)
SO LONG AS THE COFFIN IS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE PASSED OVER CONTINUALLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0024)
IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFIN IS NOT ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0025)
THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE HEART THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0026)
INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THIS CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0027)
A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUKKISWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0028)
IN HIS WILL HE BELIEVED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING IN THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0029)
TO THIS GROWING FEELING AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0030)
JUST BEFORE THIS PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0031)
ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEATH EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0032)
SOMETIMES WITH A GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS ON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0033)
ANOTHER FAVORITE VISITOR AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0034)
IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0035)
DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE AND A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET UP IN A DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0036)
HE TARRIED AT KENESHAW A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP TO GAADO WHERE I THEN RESIDED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE WINTER CAME ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS STAY	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0000)
THE ENRAGED HUSBAND WELL KNOWING THAT HE SHOULD FEEL A BLOW IF HE WAITED TO HEAR THE ORDER APPOINTED INSTANTLY RETREATED AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS CATTLE	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0001)
WE PROTECTED THE POOR NANTICOKE WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUALS AND ALLAN SYMPATHISED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES TILL SPRING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE PROMISED A REFORMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OF RENEWAL OF HER AFFECTIONS	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0002)
THE INDIANS WERE ALSO ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN OFFICER THAT THE WAMPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS ARDENTLY WISHED FOR	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0003)

PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETER'S LIPS TWITCHED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0010)
BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN SHE SPOKE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0011)
A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COACH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0012)
DON KLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0013)
IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GREY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK ON HILLSIDE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0014)
THEN SO GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0015)
AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE HAND THAT WAS USABLE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0016)

BELLIE LAUGHED GAILY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0024)
AND YOU NEVER DO THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0025)
HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK A SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0026)
BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THIS QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT'S	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0027)
AFTER A MOMENT BILLIE STIRRED AND SIGHED HAPPILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0028)
YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MAJOR ARKWRIGHT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0029)
AND AND YOU DIDN'T CARE SPECIALLY TO FOR MISS WINTHROP	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0030)
BILLY PUT A SOFT FINGER ON HER LIPS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0031)
BERTRAM KISSED THAT FINGER AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0032)
BUT WHAT IS THAT IS THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0033)

BILLY I' AM GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0035)

I WONDER IF YOU THINK I MAY GET READY TO BE MARRIED IN FIVE DAYS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0039)
DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIA GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0040)

BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAM CRAFTLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0042)
THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WAS NOT SLOW TO READ IT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0043)
SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS LITTLE LEFT ARM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0044)
LADY MY DEAR	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0045)
IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE NEARER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0046)
WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE ME	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0047)

YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE SHUT IN BERTRAM MERRILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0051)
WE WANTED IT TO NIGHT BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0052)
YET SO STRONG IS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0000)
A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MIGHT NOW FULFILL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0001)
TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM VERY IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0002)
BECAUSE IN HIS CELLAR DAYS HE DALLIED WITH THE GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0003)
UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK THEY LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0004)
HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY THE MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0005)
WE WROTE TO MARIAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0006)
WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME OR SEE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0007)
I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFINS AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0008)
BUT WHY THE DEUCE DOES HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0009)
I HAD HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0010)
POVERTY I CAN HARDLY SUPPOSE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0011)
BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFF FOR A LONG TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0012)
WAS THEY STILL SO VERY POOR	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0013)
HE ASKED AMY COMPASSIONATELY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0014)
I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOT FAILED UTTERLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0015)
OR IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0016)
PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN HOPELESS LOVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0017)
HE SENT ME A COPY OF A NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0018)
HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE EQUALLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0019)
AMYS MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0020)
ESPECIALLY NOT THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0021)
IS IT SO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0022)
EVEN IF MISTER YOULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0023)
OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO BRAVE THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0024)
HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0025)
I HAVE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0026)
THIS WAS SILENCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0027)
THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MAKE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0028)
RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN WE FIRST KNEW ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0029)
BUT JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0030)
YOU DON'T NOTICE ANYTHING FALLING OFF IN MY WORK RECENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0031)
DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE FRONT AND SO ON GENERALLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0032)
SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED IT WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0033)
THEIR STORY IN THAT GIRL'S PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0034)
AND I COULD SO EASILY HAVE PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0035)
I SURMISE AND THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0036)
DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE LIFTED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0037)
I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVORSABLE WHAT CAN I DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0038)
THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY HEALTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0039)
WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRUBBLING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0040)
AGAIN JASPER HELD THE WHITE SOFT HEAD FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0041)
YES FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0042)
MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HIS COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0043)
SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HIS HEART	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0044)
HE CAME ABRUPTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0045)
HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN ANSWERED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0046)
THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS IN THE BATTLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0047)
I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN BUT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0048)
YOU' ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0049)
MORE OF THE BRUTE YE MEAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0050)
YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DONT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0051)

GUESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0053)
WILL YOU MARRY ME BUT LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0054)
YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR BROTHER AT PRESENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0055)
I SHOULD NOT BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0056)
THEN SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0057)
DEAR I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAVE BECOME BLIND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0058)
HAS THIS ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0059)
WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE THE ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0060)
AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0061)
SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND RESPECTED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0062)
AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER MY FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU WERE MY WIFE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0063)
IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT WILLIAM AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0064)
SAID JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0065)
DO HE THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0066)
THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THAT PLAIN TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0067)
I DON'T TRUST TO MYSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0068)
OR SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILLINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0069)

IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DESTROYED YOURSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0074)
WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN DIANA	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0075)
HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0076)
I DO LOOK IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0077)
HER EMOTION HAD SOME EFFECT ON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0078)
THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER SOMETHING FOR HER PARENTS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0079)
YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0080)
IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR OUR FATHER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0081)
GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIAN I CAN'T STAND THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0082)
I MUST BE FAITHFUL TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0083)
HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER AND MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0084)
MOVING TO FALL HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0085)
WITH WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0086)
BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT DID SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0087)
YOU DIDN'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0088)
HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY SAINT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0089)
AND IS IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0090)
FOR IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0091)
IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I CAN LOVE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0092)
WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO HIM MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0093)
REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS OURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0094)
SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND IF I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0095)
WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTHS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0096)
IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMEN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0097)
MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT THEIR MEETING DURING THAT TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0098)
THAT SEEMS TO ME A CHILDISH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0099)
THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MYSTERY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0100)
JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ALMOST CALMLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0101)

GOOD BYE SHE GAVE HIM THE HAND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0105)

SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0001)
THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT TO EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0002)

NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIERS AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0000)
IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USUAL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0001)

AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON OUR LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0005)
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE IS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTER HOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0006)

I MUST NECESSARILY EXIST	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0003)
WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS A ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONSTITUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0004)
AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD IN SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSE THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWS THEREFROM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0005)
BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANYTHING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTELY NATURE	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0006)
COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN SCHOLASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS ECCENDI ERUM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0007)
COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MOTIONS BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0008)

HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL TO EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0000)
IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LAST VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0001)
LIKE THEM HE IS THE NOVELIST OF CULTURE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0002)
CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DISTINCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0003)
HE MAY NOT BE A ROYAL AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0004)

DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED THE SCENE OF NEKHLUDOFF IN RESURRECTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0007)
THIS IS A MAD HOUSE CRIED SOME ONE IN THE IDIAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0008)
ONE RESULTS OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0009)
EVEN THEIR TALK WAS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0010)
HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE TUCK	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0011)
BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH IN A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0012)
HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD BELIEVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0013)
HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY NIGHT HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0014)
THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ANA KARENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0015)
WE SYMPATHIZED INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0016)
HE IS GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY IN PASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0017)

HE INVENTS VICARIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0019)
HE WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CUTS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0020)
AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE MORTAL MANIACS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0021)

IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0024)
NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE THROUGH SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0025)
DOSTIEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0026)
ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL A'PANCHAN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETTA PROKOFFIEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RODONSKY PRINCESS BELLEOKONSKI AGLAYA PRINCE MISHKIN KOLYA IVOLGAN IPPOLYTE VAYA FERUSHENKO NASTASIA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA TITZIN N GENERAL VOLGAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0027)
BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE SOLITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0028)
MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ADMITS THE DEFINITION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0029)
TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF HIS STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0030)
AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0031)
ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRE TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0032)
BESIDES THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0033)
THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE SURE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0034)

THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CERTEVOS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0036)
THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE OWN UNBELIEF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0037)
AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATION THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0038)
OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MISHKIN IN THE MIDNIGHT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0039)
HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE WEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0040)
THE DEVILS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0041)
AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUGUES DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0042)
WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN THE POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THEIR PRISON DOORS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0043)
AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND TENDER MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0044)
THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVEL A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0045)
THERE IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0046)
AND HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0000)
HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND SUMMER	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0001)
TRUTH TO TELL MISSUS HARDY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0002)
HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE WHOLLY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0003)
THEN HE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0004)
THERE SHOULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0005)
AND PROSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS ON IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0006)
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POLE ABOUT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0007)
WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THAT THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0008)
CARTERING CARE IS AN APPALLING PHRASE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0009)
AND A LINE OF GOOD POETRY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0010)
YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YE DID NOT COME	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0011)
THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUAL MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVEL OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0012)
HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT THE FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0013)
ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST PRINCESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0014)
BUT WHAT A CHANCE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0015)
A WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0016)
TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER AND THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0017)
TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDE'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0018)
FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD SURELY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0019)
BUT TIME TO TAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0020)
AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDI'S POEMS THE OXEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0021)
WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN OUR STORY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0022)
THE MOOD OF DEATH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOOD	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0023)
HE COULD ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0024)
HOW LONG HE CRIES IN HIS POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0025)
WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORNING TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0026)
BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION AS SENIOR SOUL FLAMES AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0027)
AND GENERAL HELL HOLD OFF OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0028)
SOME FICKLE AND SWEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM NEW LOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0029)
AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DULL THEY ON OUR DEEDS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0030)
MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BUSY A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0031)
THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A SERIOUS IRRELEVANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0032)
IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDIER'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0033)
FUTITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0034)
HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS BROUGHT IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0035)
LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERE TO BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0036)
IN BEYOND THE LAST LENGTH WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0037)
NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON TO YOURS ONE RAVEN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVATURES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0038)
THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE IMMENSER THAN OUR OWN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0039)
NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSELIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLACKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0040)
IT'S A SAD THING FOR A CHILD TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T IT	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0000)
PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYHOW THOUGHT THE AULDER SISTER WISTFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0001)
DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND TALKED ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0002)
SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THO SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMIRED IT FOR THE WORLD	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0003)

I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH HER GREAT	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0009)
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL FADED NOW	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0010)
TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER MOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0011)
IT WAS VERY KIND OF OLD ADELA TO SEND IT SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0012)
WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT SUGGESTED PENELOPE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0013)

IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSES IN HEIRLOOM AFTER ALL	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0018)
PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HURT COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY AND THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS A POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0019)
SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY CREATURE THERE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0020)
PENELOPE HAD THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER CHARMING	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0021)
SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF A FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HERSELF	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0022)

SOON AFTER THAT OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSE HOLD WAS BROKEN UP	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0028)
MY DEAR I WAS A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0029)
NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FARWORTH'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0030)
DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LEAVES AND PLANTS CHANGED IN THE TWINED CLING OF THE EYE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0031)
WHEN MISSUS FAIREWETHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0032)
AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CAME TO HER FROM BELOW	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0000)

BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHERE SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0006)
THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX ABOUT THE KITCHEN WHICH SYDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0007)
HER BED AND THE COT WHERE A LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0008)

SYDNEY HATED THAT MEASURE AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD HATE ANYTHING	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0010)
HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SYDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME TO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THE DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0011)
PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO FIGHT WITH A FLUSH OF REAL EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0012)

AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEADA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0008)
WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FASSES	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0009)
WITH ME THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0010)
ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SRAMATTAI	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0011)
HE WITH HIS COMRADES SHOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0012)
ADAIR'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0013)
AND NOW SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0014)
HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER FOR THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0015)
IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE NOBLES	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0016)
THEN IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0017)
SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE KEEPING WITH HIM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0018)
SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HEAD	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0019)
KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF EIS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0020)
THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH AND A DRAGON	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0021)
IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THAT GOLDEN FLEECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0022)
BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM OUR CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0023)
THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS ARMS UPON THE GROUND	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0024)
I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS AS IT WAS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0025)
AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDIA GROW WIDE AND WITH FEAR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0026)
PHRONTIS AND MELLUS WENT WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0027)
AND AS A POET APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0000)
AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETIS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0001)
THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED TO ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0002)
THEREAFTER ADMEETUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0003)
THE RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0004)
THE APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0005)
WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE OH APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID NEDMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0006)
BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE IT WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0007)
HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ALMOST IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0008)
ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU WILL NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0009)
IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS ADMEDUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0010)
IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE UPON GO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0011)
AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON THE STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0012)
THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN ON HER MATTED HAIR	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0013)
HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO AND DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0014)
BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANXIOUS WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0015)
ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THIS KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0016)
THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0017)
ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE HUMAN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0018)
NOW THE BOOKS SEEMED TO STOP	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0019)
IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE WITH HIM AS BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0020)
AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO TO DEATH IN HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0021)
DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR THEM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0022)
NO NOT HERE FOR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0023)
SHE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0024)
NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM THEM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0025)
AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BEHIND THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0026)
TO WHAT GOD IS THAT CIRCUMSTANCE DUE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0027)
AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER WAR WAS BEFORE HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0028)
I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GUARD OF THE UNDERWORLD	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0029)
WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE HIS DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0030)
AND WHAT A NOBLE THEME IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE TO HER HUSBAND	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0031)
HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND THEY WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0032)
YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM HIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0033)
AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING IT WITH HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0034)
SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS WOULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0035)
HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGIN BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0036)
THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I NEVER HAD PAINS ENOUGH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0037)
THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOME	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0038)
HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THEN HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0000)
CHRISTIAN I HAVE GONE TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0001)
CHRISTIAN SIRS I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0002)
I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATES THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0003)
HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR GOD AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0004)
A CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0005)
THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS SON TO SWEEP IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0006)
CHRISTIAN THAT MEANS THIS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0007)
THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COMING TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAY IT LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0008)
JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAUS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHEN IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0009)
AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRAVE ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0010)
CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CHRIST'S BLESSED TOMB	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0011)
HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WAS IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0012)
CHRISTIAN SIRS WHITHER COME YOU AND WHERE DO WE GO	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0013)
FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT DALIN FOR PRAISE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0014)
KNOW YE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS THE THIEF	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0015)
THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE THE LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0016)
YES SAY THEY NO DOUBT OF IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0017)
AND IF WE'RE GETTING IN THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ARTS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0018)
IS NOT OUR AGE AS GOOD AS YOURS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0019)
I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE IS A SPRING	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0020)
NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT ON THE HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0021)
NOT HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0022)
TIMARU SAID THAT TSAYING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0023)
YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0024)
YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS COAT FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0025)
YOU FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0026)
SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS ARROW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0027)
OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHIUGH HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0028)
SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS HOPE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0029)
HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THAT TIME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0030)
NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHEN FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0031)
WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCRO	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0032)
HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREASTS OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0033)
WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAMB THE HILLS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0034)
I THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRINGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0035)
THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HAUL AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0036)
FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE SENT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0037)
KEEP IN THE MIST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0038)
THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE THE WATCHFALL DWELT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0039)
CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO MORROW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0040)
WHEN WATCHON TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0041)
THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITHIN IT TO THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0042)
HIGHTI COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0043)
CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU COULD ASK IT OF ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0044)
PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT THIAR	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0045)
THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEPTH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0046)
CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABE'S CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0047)
CHARITY NOW WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0048)
BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR LET ME LEAVE THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0049)
THUS DID CHRISTIAN WALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN THE LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0050)
AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JOHN BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAIN AND THE STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIETH OF GATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0051)
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIANS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0052)
THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANNUS LAND	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0053)
MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD YOU ARE NOW HIS JUDGE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0000)
JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT SO LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0001)
THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THIS YOU SEE THE MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0002)
THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM ITS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0003)
COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID CHRIS AND LET US WALK ON THE GRASS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0004)
SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE STREETS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0005)
HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT IN THE RIGHT PATH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0006)
HOPEFUL SAYING NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0007)
CHRISTIAN WE MUST ALL STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0008)
THEN SAID WE IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0009)
THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN THE FORT	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0010)
AND BY THIS AID WE CURE OUR SOULS AS WELL	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0011)
FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER A MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0000)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE UNIVERSE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0001)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE A MAN HAD ITS SPADE NOTHING DISMAYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0002)
SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWEVER GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0003)
THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PRACTICE OF MEN AND OTHER ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0004)
NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAGE IT IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0005)
THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF THOSE ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0006)
THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0007)
THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET THE MOUNTAINS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0008)
SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BIT MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THEIR PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0009)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE SAFE INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE A MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0010)
MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATE MEN IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0011)
THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DEMEANEN OVER PLANS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0012)
NOW I MEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0013)
I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNIC HAVE BEEN STERILE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0014)
THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITYS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0015)
IN EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTS OF NATURE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0016)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0017)
THEREFORE IN THIS STATE OF INNOCENCE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0018)
IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MAN CAN BE CALLED MASTER	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0019)

AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE'S NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0018)
BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOW FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0019)
MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR HUSBAND	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0020)
THIS WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0021)
