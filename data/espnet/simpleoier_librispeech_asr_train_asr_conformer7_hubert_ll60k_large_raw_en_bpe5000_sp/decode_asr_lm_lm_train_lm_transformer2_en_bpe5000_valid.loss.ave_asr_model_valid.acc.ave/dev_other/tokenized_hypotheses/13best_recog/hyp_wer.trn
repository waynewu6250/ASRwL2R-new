AND WILL HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING	(116-288045-116-288045-0027)
WILL HE NEVER SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN	(116-288045-116-288045-0028)
WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CAST HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS	(116-288045-116-288045-0029)
I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER AND MY FACE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT	(116-288045-116-288045-0030)

A MYTH IS A FANCIED EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON	(116-288047-116-288047-0000)
THAT MIND CRAVES FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN INBORN DESIRE TO KNOW	(116-288047-116-288047-0001)
NOW AND THEN WE CAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER	(116-288047-116-288047-0002)

AND YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY	(116-288048-116-288048-0001)
WHY IS DISCREPANCY IN THE HISTORICAL DOCTRINE TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION	(116-288048-116-288048-0002)
AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANTS JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH	(116-288048-116-288048-0003)

AND WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDAS AND MARY	(116-288048-116-288048-0012)
THERE IS UTTERLY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED	(116-288048-116-288048-0013)

PETERS PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY	(116-288048-116-288048-0017)
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND OF HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM	(116-288048-116-288048-0018)
COULD HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM	(116-288048-116-288048-0019)
HOW ELSE IS THIS UNANIMOUS SENSE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR	(116-288048-116-288048-0020)
HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THEIR NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES	(116-288048-116-288048-0021)

HOW MANY SELF DELUDED PROTESTS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED	(116-288048-116-288048-0027)
AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSE BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES	(116-288048-116-288048-0028)

IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MERCY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0000)
STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR METEOR OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF A LEAF	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0001)
IF ANYTHING WOULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0002)

THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED OPEN	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0005)
THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0006)

MY FATHER'S IS JUST A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0008)
FOR HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0009)
YOU'VE HEARD TOO	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0010)
I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T KNOW ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0011)
MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALMOST SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0012)
WAS THERE THIS EVENING	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0013)
THERE ON THE NETS THEY SATE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0014)
JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE FRIEND OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0015)
NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING AT BUDMOUTHTOWN IF EVER I REACH IT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0016)
IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHEN YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0017)
THE ISLAND WAS IN ISLAND STILL	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0018)
THEY HAD NOT THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0019)
HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM THEN SHE MADE NO OBJECTION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0020)
HE PITIED HER BUT WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0021)
THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A VAULT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0022)
HE WOULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0023)
I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU ABOUT SOMETHING TO EAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0024)
HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND AT THE SAME TIME	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0025)
BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVING TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0026)
YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRLS SAID PEARSON	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0027)
HE THEN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0028)
THAT WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0029)
AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE ABBES CAROL	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0030)
SHE CALLS CLOSE AND SATISFIES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0000)
HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS SPINAVAN'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0001)
AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART THE WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0002)
YET THIS WAS NOT ALL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0003)
BUT WAS HE LATE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0004)
IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN ALTHOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0005)
HE TURNED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0006)
SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LAST	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0007)
BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELLPOOLS SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0008)
RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HER AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0009)
JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD MARE HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0010)
SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED IN GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0011)
YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY DAY	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0012)
DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES OH EVER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0013)
NOT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0014)
IT IS ALSO UNCIVIL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0015)
AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY BACK AS HE COULD	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0016)
I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANLLCLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0017)
JOSCELYN PIERDEN	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0018)
WELL DIDN'T HE MARRY HER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0019)
SAID MISSUS PINEAM WITH A START	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0020)
BUT JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S EYES WITH LONG STRIDES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0021)
LADY ARRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICOLA PINE AVEN	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0022)
SHE HAD BEEN THE LAST ARRIVAL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0023)
AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO THE SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0024)
HE HAD NOT BEEN ABOUT TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0025)
THE SPRING OF THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0026)
THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF THE APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0027)
IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMAN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0028)
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH TILL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0000)
THE VOICE OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0001)
HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST OF A PERSONAL SURRENDER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0002)
WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OR MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOUR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGES OR FORBID ITS VERY USE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0003)
POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVEALED IN THE VENSION IS SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD AND IT SOME CHECK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0004)
POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVETISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A WHOLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0005)
ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN RIGHT AND FAST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0006)
YET THE VERY VOGAL OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0007)
A NUMBER OF PARENT ARCLIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR THE STREET LINING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0008)
THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRED IN FELT WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0009)
HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0010)
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMIC ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0011)
IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE PRESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES AND THE LEADING CITIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0012)
THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT COMES FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0013)
WHERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0014)
THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE THE ARC LIGHT BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0015)
HERE AGAIN HAS GIVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0016)
THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF SITTERS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0017)
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF HIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0018)
SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY ORIGIN OF WHICH THERE WERE PLENTY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0019)
YET IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0020)
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENIA INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0021)
WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AN ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM IN THE BALLASTON WATTAGE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0022)
WOULD SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0023)
THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DONE TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0024)
ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN THEY STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0025)
AFTER FEELING OUT FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLUE HOW TO DO IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0026)
THEY THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0027)
INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO EDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING IN THE CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HAM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0028)
FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GORWORK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0029)
TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONE PARADES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON OOCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND NUMBERLESS OTHER DETAILS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0030)
IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLYD COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR HIS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOWROOMS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0031)
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND HIS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0032)
THE EXPERIENCE WITH A LITTLE GAS ENGINE IS RATHER STARTLING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0033)
ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND IT WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING A RAND	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0034)
FOR THE FIRST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEE HIVE DAY AND NIGHT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0035)
THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARDNACKLET OF THE CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0036)
I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM OUT OF MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0037)
HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SEIGURS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0038)
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE AB WITH HAIR AND NO PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0039)
WE THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0040)
I DIDN'T REMEMBER NOTHING ABOUT IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0041)
I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO GET NOTICE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0042)
SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF NIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS RAMONE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0043)
HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO SING HIS VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0044)
THAT NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0045)
AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE EIGHT AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0046)
ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRESHIP	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0047)
HE COULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0048)
SPEAKING OF TELLERS DORIS I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LINEN FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0049)
IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS COWING FIRST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0050)
I HAD NOTHING TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE COLD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0051)
THEN THEY GOT PLEURISY AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0052)
HE HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND A PERILOUS PLEASURE OF FACTING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0053)
NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REGARDED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0054)
LONDON IS GOUT AND GLORY	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0000)
THEY SAY BEST MEN ARE MOLDED OUT OF THOUGHT AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0001)
STANDING ON THE BROKEN COLUMNS OF THE OLD STEEPER THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAM STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UTTERED THE FOLLOWING ORRITORICAL FLIGHT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0002)
GLORIOUS GOLDEN	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0003)
SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS ONE ROMANCE OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WHARF BAT AND BEATEN SHOULD ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDENT DESOLATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0004)
THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNLY COUCHES	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0005)
WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBERING AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE ENFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHUS UNTIL THE POTTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK IN THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0006)
OUR FIRST SIGHT OF THE SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD AS GLOWING EXPECTATIONS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0007)
OFT EXPORTATION FOULTS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST E PROMISES AND OFT HE HITS WHEN HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FLITS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0008)
DUSIS ONE DUBL WHEN SIX IS TREBACOY	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0009)
WILLEM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CENAPOT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0010)
THE QUIET JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE A WORD FOR IT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0011)
I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON A CASTE AND WOULD WITHSTAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0012)
I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BUS PAPS SHE WAS FONDLING HER CAPACIOUS LAP	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0013)
IF HE HAD DROPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCIAL	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0014)
THE PREEN'S SHOP OF FOUR WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVEN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0015)
JAMES BURRIBRIDGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS PLUMP MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0016)
IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAVE BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0000)
THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0001)
THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE THAT THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0002)
THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE LAST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0003)
THAT MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0004)
HE WHO FEARS TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0005)
HAVE THEY REQUIRED A TRUE LOVE OF FREEDOM	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0006)
THE GREAT EPOCH OF THE SOUL OF HER PEOPLE THE MAHABADA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0007)
WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS STIRRED IN A COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0008)
IT HARDENED WITH AN AGE OF INERT CONSTRUCTION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0009)
THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ARDOUR WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0010)
LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMITTED BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR VITAL FUNCTIONS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0011)

IN THE LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED HER TO BLEED HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0015)
IF YOU THINK THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0016)
YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF A CURE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0017)
AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUAK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0018)
THAT VERY MORNING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0019)
DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME FROM ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0020)

MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DYE FOR THE MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0045)

I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESS THE WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0050)
THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREATEST CREDIT HE HAD GAINED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0051)
I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND ON A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0052)

I LIFTED MY COAT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0054)
WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I THOUGHT TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0000)
TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I CAN STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0001)

HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELERS EMBARKED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0003)
WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SMASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0004)
WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RONAN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0005)
NOW ALAS BY THE MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0006)
HE SPOKE SO FRIENDLYLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0007)
THEN THE ROANA SAID TO THE BOATMAN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0008)
WHAT THINKS YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0009)
THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONLAND HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0010)
WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONON OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WARNING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0011)
FORTUNE FAVORING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE CARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0012)
SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NEVER BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0013)

AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVERLETS HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0017)
THREE YEARS AGO AT THE CUANAS FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0018)
HAPLY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAVE LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0019)
OF MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MARVELLOUS AILMENT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0020)

AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNER AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0005)
EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILLFUL BALANCER OF PROSE AND KHANS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ACTION OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0006)

OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHERE THE ROOF IS RAISED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0010)
A HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0011)
A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABORERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGEPOLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCRAMBLED JOYFULLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0012)

THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MIGHT INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0026)

WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAVE TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0052)

A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFILLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0001)
TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS CITY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0002)
BECAUSE IN HIS CELLARED DAYS HE DALLIED WITH THE GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0003)

NO IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0016)
PERCHANCE MY DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0017)
HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW THEM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0018)
HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0019)
A AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0020)
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER DAUGHTER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0021)
AND IS IT SO SERIOUS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0022)
EVEN IF MISTER YULES RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0023)
OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THERE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0024)
HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDANTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0025)
I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY APPRECIATE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0026)
AND THERE WAS SILENCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0027)

DID YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0032)
SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHILE THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0033)
YOUR STORY IN THAT GIRL'S PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0034)
AND I WOULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0035)
I SURMISE THIS THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0036)
DON'T LOOK ON ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0037)
I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT COULD I DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0038)

WELL I'LL GO BACK INTO MY SCRIBBLING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0040)
AGAIN JASPER HELD THE GREAT SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0041)
YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0042)
MARIANNE COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0043)
SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE HARSH BEATS OF HER HEART	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0044)
HE BECAME ABRUPTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0045)
HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED WHEN ADDED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0046)
THERE WERE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN A BATTLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0047)

YOU WILL FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0055)
I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASP	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0056)
SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0057)
DEAR I CAN'T FEEL IT TO BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0058)
HAS ONE THING AGREED TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0059)
WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A GENTLEMAN WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0060)
AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THAN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0061)
SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0062)
AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU WAS MY WIFE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0063)
IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0064)
ACCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MIGHT FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0065)

THEIR EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0078)
THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR ITS PARENTS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0079)
YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU DESPISE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0080)

SHE WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0083)
HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT VIRGINIA TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0084)
MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER BRAIN WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0085)

IF I REMEMBER ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0092)
WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE DONE NOW	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0093)
REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND GIVE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0094)
SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0095)
WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THEIR TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0096)
IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0097)
MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT NOT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0098)

YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER HER REFUSAL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0110)
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THIS SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0111)
YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0112)
SEVERAL HOURS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0113)
I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU DO NOT TELL ME TOO MUCH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0114)
WE HAD THEN BUT A LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0000)
SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS RATES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0001)
THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTY FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0002)

NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND A FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0000)
IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU WERE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0001)
IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOUR IT IS TOO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0002)

AND WHEN HE WAS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0005)
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTER HOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY WHICH WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0006)

ALL THINGS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTRIBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BE INFINITE OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE ETERNAL AND INFINITE THROUGH THEIR SAID ATTRIBUTE	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0000)
PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT THE SOMETHING IN SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD CAN FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THE SAID ATTRIBUTE AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS HE IS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE OR DURATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN THE ATTRIBUTE THOUGHT	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0001)

THEY MUST NECESSARILY EXIST	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0003)
WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONSTITUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAIN OUR HYPOTHESIS	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0004)
AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD IN SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSE THAT MATTER BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEREFROM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0005)
BEAR IN MIND THAT THAT SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANY THING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0006)
COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN SCHOLASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS ACCENDI RERUM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0007)
COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR THE MODES BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0008)

LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF TASTE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0002)
SIMPLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0003)
HE CAN NOT BE A CRUEL AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0004)

ONE RESULT OF IT IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0009)
EVEN THE TALK OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0010)
HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THIS SUCK	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0011)
BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THESE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH SHE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0012)

WAS VERY FOND OF HAVING CUTS AND BEARING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0020)

NO MELODRAMATIST EVER THROWED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0025)

BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S FEELING IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0028)
MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS IN DEFINITION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0029)
TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE THAT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0030)
AND THE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0031)

THIS IS SO IN A MEASURE TRUE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0034)

THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETERS'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0037)
AND UPON THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0038)
OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MISHKIN IN THE AUDIENCE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0039)
HIS WORD LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0040)
THEIR NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0041)
AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUGOIS DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0042)
WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0043)
AT ALL OTHER TIME HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0044)
THAT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THEIR NOVELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0045)
IT IS A FIRE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0046)

HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF DARKNESS AND STORM	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0001)
TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A POET	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0002)
SHE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0003)
THUS HE WRITES WHEN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0004)
THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE ENGLISH IN THE LAST LINE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0005)
AND PROSE INTRUDES AND THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0006)
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE AND THE SAME POEM ABOUT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0007)
WHEN WE AND STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0008)
CATERING CAR IS AN APPALLING PHRASE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0009)
IS A SIGN OF GOOD POETRY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0010)
YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGHER COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0011)
THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNUALE MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0012)
HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAINS AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0013)

WITH WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0015)
HIS WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF LIBERTY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0016)
TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR AS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0017)
TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISSUS HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0018)
FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD LONG WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0019)
BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKE THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0020)
AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDYE'S POEMS THE OXEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0021)
WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STORY MEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0022)
THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDE'S PREVAILING MOOD	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0023)
HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN MARCH AWAY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0024)
HOW OFTEN HE CRIES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0025)
WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORNED TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEA	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0026)
BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION AS SENIOR SOULED FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0027)
AND GENERAL HELL HOLD UP OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0028)
SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND ME NEW LOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0029)
AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DWELL THEY OF OUR DEEDS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0030)
MISS HARDY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0031)
THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDEY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0032)
IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDET'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0033)
FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING EMES IN BOTH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0034)
HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS WROUGHT IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THE GLORY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0035)

THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE STRANGER THAN OUR OWN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0039)
NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLINDS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0040)
IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHERE SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T IT	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0000)

IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL VANISHED NOW	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0010)
TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUES A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0011)
IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELA TO SEND IT SAYS DORIS DUTIFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0012)
WHY THE WRONG PART IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PENELOPE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0013)

IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSES AND HERLOOM AFTER ALL	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0018)
PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEARTED COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY IN THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS A POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0019)
SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY BOY THERE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0020)
PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER BECOMING	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0021)
SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAS JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HERSELF	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0022)

BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BODY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0006)

A BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRL SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0008)

AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDERA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0008)
WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE CASSIS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0009)
FROM HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0010)
ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SARAMA TAI	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0011)
HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE HIM FOR YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0012)
ADE'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0013)
AND WHEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0014)
HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN OR HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0015)
IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE ANGELS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0016)
AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEARAWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0017)
SHE ADDED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0018)
SHE HAD A DARK FACE IT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0019)
KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ARIS YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0020)
THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THE DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0021)
IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0022)
BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY SEAT EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0023)
THEN JAPSON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0024)
I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS ENOUGH AS IT IS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0025)
AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDINA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0026)
PHRONTIUS AND MELLUS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0027)
AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREATH AMONGST MEN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0000)
AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AN EVER RADIANT BEING	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0001)
THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON AN ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0002)
THEREAFTER ADMETUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0003)
A RADIANT PICTURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0004)
BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS NOT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0005)
WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE OH APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID MEDMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0006)
BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS NOT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0007)
HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD OFTEN IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0008)
ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THAT BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0009)
IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS ADMEDIS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0010)
IF HE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0011)
AND THEN HE CAME UPON A ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0012)
THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYE BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0013)
HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER THEN HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0014)
BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME UPON THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0015)
ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS FOR HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0016)
THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO A CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0017)
ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KEY AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0018)
NOT THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0019)
IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FROM HIM AS BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0020)
AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0021)
DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR US	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0022)
NOT HERE FOR YE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0023)
THEY LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0024)
NO MORE SEARCH CAME FROM HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0025)
AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT HIS TERRIBLE LOSS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0026)
WHAT GOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DUE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0027)
AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER WORLD WAS BEFORE HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0028)
I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUIDES THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0029)
WHY SHOULD HE NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0030)
BUT WHAT A NOBLE THEME IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0031)
HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMERUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0032)
YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEAD AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0033)
AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0034)
SHE WAS VEILED AND ADEMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0035)
HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM THE ENEMY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0036)
THIS I COULD NOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PAINS ENOUGH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0037)
THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD GIVEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0038)
HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT A DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0000)
CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE MAN OF THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0001)
CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MEET ZION	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0002)
I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD TELL ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0003)
HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD WITH MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0004)
CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEANS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0005)
THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGER ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0006)
CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0007)
THEN YOU NEXT SAW A MAID COME IN TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0008)
JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE KRAW HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0009)
AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BLACK ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0010)
CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CROSS BLESSED ROOM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0011)
HE WENT ON THIS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0012)
CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DID YOU GO	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0013)
FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN A LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZION FOR PRAISE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0014)
KNOW YO'RE NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0015)
THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE A LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0016)
YES SAID WE NO DOUBT OF IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0017)
AND IF WE'RE GETTING A ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0018)
IS NOT THE CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0019)
I SAW THEM THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0020)
NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THAT HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0021)
NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HALL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0022)
TIMARU SAID THAT TSYING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0023)
YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLIPPED OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0024)
YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR THE SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0025)
HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOTHING	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0026)
SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THAT ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0027)
O FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHILL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0028)
SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SINS THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS SLEEP	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0029)
HOW FAR CAN I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0030)
NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME INTO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0031)
WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAVE GOT BACK HIS SCROLL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0032)
HE LAID IT ON IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0033)
WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLAMB THE FIELD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0034)
WHY THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS WRINGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0035)
THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGER OF THE HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0036)
FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FATE OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0037)
KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHOULD COME TO THEE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0038)
THEN I SAW IN MY DREAMS THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE WATCHFUL DWELT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0039)
CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0040)
WHEN WATCH FULL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0041)
THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH HIM TO THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0042)
HARDEE COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0043)
CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD SHE SHOULD ASK IT OF ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0044)
PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT THIANG	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0045)
THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THEN I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0046)
CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0047)
CHARITY SAID WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0048)
BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOT HAVE ME LEAVE THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0049)
THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PIECE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0050)
AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JAW BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAIN AND A STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0051)
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SIR CHRISTIAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0052)
THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANEOUS LAND	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0053)
MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO AM NOW HIS JUDGE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0000)
DOCTOR THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0001)
THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THIS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HATH MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0002)
THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TRAVEL THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0003)
COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID CHRISTINE LET US WALK ON THE GRASS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0004)
SO I SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELDS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0005)
HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE PUT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0006)
HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT FOR OUR GOOD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0007)
CRITIC WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0008)
THEN SAID DRY IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIES IS MINE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0009)
THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FORTH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0010)
THEN BY THIS ACT WE CURE OUR SOULS AS WELL	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0011)
FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0000)
THEREFORE IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0001)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPATE NOTHING DISBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0002)
SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOWUS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0003)
THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A QUANTITY OF MEN AND OTHER ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0004)
NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS SEPARATED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0005)
THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE DESIRABLE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0006)
THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THINGS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0007)
THAT IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LET THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0008)
SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE A BRIGHT MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0009)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE CIVIL INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0010)
MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0011)
THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAS NO DEMEANING OVER PLANS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0012)
NOW MEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF THE MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0013)
I ANSWERED THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNI HAVE BEEN STERILE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0014)
HERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0015)
AN EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0016)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0017)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0018)
