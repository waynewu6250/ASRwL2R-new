YOU HAVE HEARD SIR	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0010)
I DIDN'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0011)
MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY WAS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0012)
WAS IT THIS EVENING	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0013)
THERE IN THE NETS THEY SAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0014)
JOSCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUE TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0015)
NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUMMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0016)
IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPENED EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0017)
THIS ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0018)
THEY HAD NOT REALISED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS UNTIL NOW	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0019)
HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM BUT SHE MADE NO OBJECTION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0020)
HE PITIED HER WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0021)
THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD IN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0022)
HE COULD SEE NOW THAT ALTHOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0023)
I WILL TELL THE SERVANTS TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0024)
HE WAS RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0025)
BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWN STAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMEN'S RAIMENT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0026)
YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PEARTON	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0027)
HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE DANGER WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0028)
THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THE ATTIRE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0029)
AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVIS CARROW	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0030)
SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES IT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0000)
HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS FINAVAN'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0001)
AFTERWARD THEY KEPT APART A WHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0002)
BUT THIS IS NOT ALL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0003)
AND WAS HE ABLE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0004)
IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FORWARD WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0005)
HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THIS NEW INCARNATION	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0006)
SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0007)
BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL POLE SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0008)
RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHT INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN HER CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0009)
JUST AS THEY TURNED MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD HEIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0010)
SHE THAWED A LITTLE THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0011)
I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0012)
DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES OR NEVER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0013)
AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0014)
IT IS VERY UNCIVIL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0015)
AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE WOULD	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0016)
I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANCLIFF'S THE OTHER NIGHT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0017)
JOSCELYN PIERSTON	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0018)
OH DOESN'T HE MARRY HER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0019)
SAID MISSUS PINEVEN WITH A START	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0020)
AND JOSCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0021)
LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICOLA PINE HAVEN	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0022)
SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0023)
AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE THEM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0024)
HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THAT TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0025)
THIS SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0026)
THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR A TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0027)
IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOSCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATES FOR SOME POST IN TOWN WHICH SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0028)
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE EVENTS CAN BE SEEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0000)
THE WAY OF AN INVENTOR IS HARD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0001)
HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT THE DISTRESSFUL COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0002)
WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOUR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APALOGES OR FORBID ITS VERY USE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0003)
POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTISM AS REVIEWED IN THE VENTION IS SEEKING THE HIGHER GOOD AND YET SOME CHECK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0004)
POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVETICISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0005)
ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAVE BEEN RIGHTING FAST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0006)
YES THE VERY VOGUEAL OF THE ELECTRIC ART LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0007)
A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR STREET LINING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0008)
THUS IN THE CUREST MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTORY LINING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRING FOUND WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0009)
HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADDISON STATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0010)
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMEL ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0011)
IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAD BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES IN THE LEADING CITIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0012)
THE FIRST STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0013)
THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING IS SHOWN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0014)
THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE ARCLAND BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0015)
HERE AGAIN IS GIVEN A MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0016)
THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF CITIES THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PRODUCE ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0017)
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS ACCOUNT OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0018)
SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY PROPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WERE PLENTY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0019)
BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA WAS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0020)
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENIE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0021)
WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID US MORE SUMDAM IN THE BALLASTON WATTAGE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0022)
HE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSANDS OF THEM	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0023)
THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0024)
ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT DEEPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0025)
AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLEW HOW TO DO IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0026)
AND THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0027)
INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEM BROUGHT TO ADDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPORTING A CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0028)
FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GO WORK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0029)
TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON ON TELEPHONES AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALIST IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WORCESTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METRES SIFTY FUSES AND OTHER DETAILS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0030)
IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTROLY LIGHT COMPANY LEASED A O B SHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FORDING STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOWROOMS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0031)
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS THE PREMONITOR SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0032)
THE EXPERIENCED WITH A LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0033)

THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEE HIVE DAY AND NIGHT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0035)
THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS ARNOCLET OF THE CLERK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0036)
I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0037)
HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF SAILORS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0038)
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE UP WITH HAIR AND OLD PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0039)
I THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0040)
I COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0041)

IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA WAS BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0000)
THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH PEOPLE OF THE WEST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0001)
THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0002)
THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE BEST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0003)
THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO THE COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0004)

BY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GRIP OF AN INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE AND WEALTH	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0012)

AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWN HIS FACE AGAIN	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0018)
THAT VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM COLD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0019)
DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME IN ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WILL BE THE DEATH OF HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0020)

THERE THEY SETTLED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0027)
MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WHILST SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0028)
AT THESE WORDS MAESTRA AUGUSTINO THE DUKE'S TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0029)

GEORGO MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0035)
THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY WHEREON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND HE HALTED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0036)

YOU WANT HIM TO IMMORTALIZE THAT FEROCIOUS TYRANT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0042)
YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT QUITE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0043)
IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0044)
MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DICE FOR THAT MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0045)
I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I SHOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0046)
I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENZO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0047)
NICCOLO DA MONTERE GUTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENCINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0048)
NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES ON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0049)
I COMPOSED THE DESIGNS OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0050)
THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THAT GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0051)
I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0052)
I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS GENERALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0053)
I LIFTED MY FEET AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0054)
WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ATTRACT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0000)
TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0001)
BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADES THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF CUANHA	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0002)
HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED AND FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELERS EMBARKED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0003)
WHEN THE BOATMAN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0004)
WHEN HE SAW THIS THE ROAN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0005)
NOW ALAS BY HIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0006)
HE SPOKE SO SMILINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0007)
THEN THE ROAN SAID TO THE BOATMAN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0008)
WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ASKED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0009)
THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE ROAN HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0010)
WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONIN OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0011)
FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVE AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0012)
SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN OR THIEF	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0013)
HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARMS AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0014)

NOW IT CHANCED THAT A STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0016)
AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY SHIVERING ALL OVER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0017)
THREE YEARS AGO AT THE UANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0018)
HAPPILY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZED FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0019)
ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MARVELLOUS AILMENTS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0020)
THINKING I CAN DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0021)
AND WOULD IT NOT BECOME ME TO BEAR MALICE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0022)
REPENT HOWEVER AND ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAYS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0023)
TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THAT HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0024)

AND HOW YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0029)

VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTIONS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0003)

AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET TILL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0005)
EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILFUL BALANCER OF PROS AND CONS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0006)

NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT KNOWING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0008)
AFTER THIS MANNER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE WAS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0009)
OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT DAY WHEN THE ROOF IS RAISED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0010)
THE HOUSEOWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKING ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0011)
A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AT HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABOURERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE BRIDGE POLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SCRAMBLE JOYFULLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0012)

NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH A BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES THE SURVIVAL OF AN OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0015)
AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSES	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0016)
THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DID CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0017)

THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT TO FEED THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0022)
LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES OF THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF TEA	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0023)
SO LONG AS THE COFFIN WAS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0024)
IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILST THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0025)
THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEELING THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0026)
INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCURRED IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THESE CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0027)
A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUSAWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0028)
IN HIS WILL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0029)
THROUGH THAT GROWING FEELING AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0030)
JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH WAS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0031)
ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICE OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0032)
SOMETIMES WITH THE GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SCENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0033)
ANOTHER FAVORITE PRESIDENT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0034)
IT SEEM MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURIAL	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0035)

MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ALLEN'S HORSE AND CARRIED THE GOODS	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0004)
ALLEYNE ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMY HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT OF HIS RETURN THEY WERE SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTLES WHO MARRIED PRISCILLA RAMSAY WITH A SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0005)

IT WAS ONE THING FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO IT OF COURSE IT'S SHE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0003)
RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF WOULDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE IS HE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0004)
INTERPOSED BILLIE TELL MISTER BERTRAM I AM HERE OR WAIT I'LL GO RIGHT IN AND SURPRISE HIM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0005)
PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW AND HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE TOWARD AUNT HANNAH	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0006)
MISS BILLY MISSUS BILLY YOU'RE AN ANGEL STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN YOU ARE YOU ARE OH I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0007)
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT HE'S IN THE DEN MISS BILLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0008)
BILLIE TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD TAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARD THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AUNT HANNAH'S INDIGNANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BILLY STOP	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0009)
PETE GO TELL OUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0010)
BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHILE HE SPOKE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0011)
A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FELL OPEN	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0012)
DONKLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEA SPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0013)
IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GRAY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK AT HILL SIDE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0014)
THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER HIM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0015)
AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS THERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USABLE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0016)
WHY OF COURSE STAMMERED BILLY I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU FOUND OUT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0017)
BERTRAM ANGRY AND MYSTIFIED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0018)
AS FOR MY NOT PAINTING AGAIN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE DEARY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0019)

WELL SHE WROTE THE LETTER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0023)
BILLIE LAUGHED GAYLY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0024)
YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0025)
HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYE LIDS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0026)
BILLIE WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT'S	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0027)
AFTER A MINUTE BILLY STIRRED AND SIGHED HEAVILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0028)
YOU SEE I WAS N'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARKWRIGHT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0029)
AND AND YOU DON'T CARE SPECIALLY FOR FOR MISS WINTHROP	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0030)
BILLY PUT A SOFT FINGER UPON HIS LIPS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0031)
BERTRAM KISSED THE PAPER AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0032)
WELL WHAT'S THAT IS THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0033)
THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN BERTRAM STIRRED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0034)
BILLIE I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0035)
I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT UNTIL THEN YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0036)
I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW I'LL GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUND THAT LAW I FORGET	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0037)
FINE DAYS INDEED SIR	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0038)
I WONDER IF YOU THINK I CAN BE READY TO BE MARRIED IN FIVE DAYS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0039)
DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0040)
IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARD NOT BEFORE BUT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0041)
BESIDES I NEEDED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAM CRAFTILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0042)
THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0043)
SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS LONG LEFT ARM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0044)
REALLY MY DEAR	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0045)
IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOOR A LITTLE LATER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0046)
I MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0047)
YOU MEAN IT'D BE BEFORE OCTOBER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0048)
AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNCERTAIN	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0049)
YES ADDED BILLY DEMURELY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0050)
YES I KNOW IT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM MERRILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0051)
WE WANTED TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0052)
YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THAT WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0000)
A PART OF THE IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFILL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0001)
TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE IN HIS OWN EYES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0002)
BECAUSE IN HIS LATTER DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0003)
UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY AROUND REGENT'S PARK	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0004)
HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S INTEREST	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0005)
HE WROTE TO MADAME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0006)
WILL YOU LET ME HEAR AND COME AND SEE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0007)
I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF GIFFIN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0008)
WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0009)
I HOPED SHE WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0010)
POVERTY I COULD ONLY SUPPOSE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0011)
BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFEN FOR A LONG TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0012)
WAS HE STILL SO POOR	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0013)
ASKED AMORY COMPASSIONATELY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0014)
I'M AFRAID SO HIS VOICE FAILED UTTERLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0015)
IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0016)
PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THIS HOPELESS LOVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0017)
HE SENT ME A COPY OF THIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0018)
HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0019)
AMY MIGHT TAKE THE FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0020)
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0021)
IS THAT SO SERIOUS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0022)
EVEN IF MISTER JULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0023)
OUR DIFFICULTIES WERE SO GRAVE THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0024)
HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FEEL DESPONDENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0025)
I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOMEDAY ACHIEVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0026)
IT WAS SILENCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0027)
THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0028)
RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YE FIRST KNEW ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0029)
JUST NOW I'M IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0030)
YOU DON'T NOTICED ANY FALLING OFF IN MY WORK RECENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0031)
DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE COURT AND SO ON GENERALLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0032)
I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0033)
HER STORY IN THAT GIRL'S PAPERS HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0034)
AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIMS UPON HER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0035)
I SURMISED THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0036)
DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PROCEEDED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0037)
I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEART BROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVORABLE WHAT CAN I DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0038)
THAT CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0039)
THEN I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRIBBLING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0040)
AGAIN JASPER HELD THE WHITE HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0041)
YET WITH SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0042)
MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE IN HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0043)
SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANGRY BEATS OF HER HEART	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0044)
IT BEGAN ABRUPTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0045)
HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD ARRANGED THEN ADDED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0046)
THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THAT BATTLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0047)
I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARTIN WHAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0048)
YOURE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0049)
MORE OF THE BRUTE YOU MEAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0050)
YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DIDN'T	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0051)
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT YOUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0052)
THUS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0053)
WOULD YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0054)
YOU CALL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0055)
I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON YOUR HEALTH JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0056)
SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP TO HIM TOUCHINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0057)
TRUE I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0058)
HAS THE THING OCCURRED TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0059)
WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A WOMAN WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0060)
AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHY THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0061)
SHE WHISPERED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0062)
AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU WERE MY WIFE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0063)
IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WELL THEN THERE IS ONLY ONE THING TO DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0064)
ACCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HOPELESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0065)
DO WE THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0066)
THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0067)
I WOULDN'T TRUST MYSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0068)
BUT YOU FACE THEM WILLINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0069)
PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MADAME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0070)
WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE CRIED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0071)
EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK IS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0072)
WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT IF IT IS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0073)
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU YOURSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0074)
WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0075)
HOW AM I TO LIVE A HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0076)
I DID WISH IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0077)
THE EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0078)
THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT THE CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR HER PARENTS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0079)
YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DID CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0080)
IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY FAMILY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0081)
GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARTIN I CAN'T STAND IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0082)
I'LL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0083)
HE MADE A PRETENSE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0084)
MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBINGS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0085)
WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0086)
BUT I WOULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0087)
YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0088)
HAPPINESS OR MISERY COMES TO US BY FATE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0089)
IS THAT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0090)
AND IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0091)
IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DO LOVE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0092)
WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE NOW	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0093)
REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOUR'S TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0094)
SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD SURELY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0095)
WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN A TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0096)
IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0097)
MADAME WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0098)
THIS SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0099)
THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE A AUTUMNAL MIST	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0100)
JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN SAID CALMLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0101)
ARE YOU GOING TO A MUSEUM YES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0102)
GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MADAME YOU CAN'T WORK	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0103)
I MUST HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0104)
GOOD BY AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0105)
THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF A TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0106)
JASPER DID NOT ANSWER HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0107)
HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TONE AND ASPECT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0108)
A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEM LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0109)
YESTERDAY MORNING SHE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0110)
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THO SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0111)

LIKE HIM HE IS A NOVELIST OF TORTURE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0002)
THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0003)
HE MAY BE A CRUEL AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0004)
BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN VIOLENCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0005)

DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SIN OF NEKHLUDOFF IN RESURRECTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0007)
THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIED SOME ONE IN THE ADIOS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0008)
ONE RESULT OF THIS WAS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0009)
EVEN THAT TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0010)
HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH A HAND BUT WITH A SUCK	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0011)
BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0012)
HE TOOK THE KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0013)
HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HE ALWAYS OBJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0014)
THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ENNA KARENNINA OR FATHERS AND SONS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0015)
WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO AND DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0016)
HE IS THE GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0017)

WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CATS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0020)
AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PROCEEDS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0021)
SERVE HIM RIGHT ADDED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0022)

IT WAS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0024)
NO MELODRAMATISTS EVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0025)
DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL AT ONCE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0026)

BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0028)
MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS AT DEFINITION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0029)
TO HIM DOSTAEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0030)
AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN DARKNESS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0031)
ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH OUGHT TO KNOW	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0032)
BECAUSE THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0033)
IT IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0034)

THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN CEPHAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0036)
THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY WAS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0037)
AND BEHIND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0038)
OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE MISTER MISHKIN IN THE IDIOT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0039)
HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARKS OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0040)
THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THAT MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0041)
AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VAUGUIER DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0042)
WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASS THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0043)
AT ALL TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0044)
IT IS A PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0045)
IT IS A FIGURE WHICH AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0046)
HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SANGER	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0000)
HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST THIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0001)
TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDEY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0002)
HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS NOR IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0003)
THIS HE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0004)
THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN THIS LAST LINE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0005)
AND PROSE INTRUDES THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0006)
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THAT PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM ABOUT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0007)
WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE AVAILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0008)
CATERING CARE WAS AN APPALLING PHRASE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0009)
IS A LINE OF POETRY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0010)
YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LOST FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS'S SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0011)
THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE INNULE MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0012)
HE HAS THE TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0013)
ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISSUS HARDY TOO LATE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0014)
AND WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0015)
HIS WORLD IS THE PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0016)
TO HAVE LIVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0017)
TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDEY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0018)
FOR THEN I UNDISTRESSED BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD ONLY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0019)
BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBING OF NOONTIDE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0020)
AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDEY'S POEMS THE OXEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0021)
WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STORY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0022)
THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDING'S PREVAILING MOOD	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0023)
HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBT AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0024)
HOW LONG HE SAYS IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0025)
WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORN TO STAND BOND SLAVE TO REALMS AND CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0026)
BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION AS SENIOR SOLDIER FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0027)
AND GENERAL HELL HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN ROYAL AS DOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0028)
SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THE NEW LOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0029)
AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DWELT THEY ON OUR DEEDS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0030)
MISTER HARDIE HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0031)
THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDIE IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0032)
IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDEY'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0033)
FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION OF EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0034)
HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS WROUGHT IN THE GRAVE DEFENDED OF THEIR GLORY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0035)

TELL ME DORRY DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIR LOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDFATHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0011)

IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSES AND HER LOOM AFTER ALL	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0018)
PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY AND THE EVENING ON THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND REHUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS THE POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BEST SPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0019)
SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL HERE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0020)
PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALSO CHARMING	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0021)

THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH A SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0021)
IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU A GOLDEN FLEECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0022)
BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHEW HIMSELF AS BRAVE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0023)
THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYE UPON THE GROUND	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0024)
I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS MAD AS IT IS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0025)
AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0026)
PHRONTIS AND MELLIS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0027)
AND AS A MORAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0000)
EVERYWHERE PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0001)
THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0002)
THEREAFTER ADMETUS HAVING A LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0003)
A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO THEM AGAIN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0004)
BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE WHICH WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0005)
WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0006)
BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE THEM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0007)
HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE WHICH HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0008)
ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FROM ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0009)
IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS AND MEDIS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0010)
IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0011)
AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT ON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0012)
THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0013)
HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0014)
BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0015)
ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0016)
THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING TO HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0017)
ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE QUEEN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0018)
NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO START	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0019)
IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR THEM AS BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0020)
AND IN THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0021)
DEATH WOULD SOON BE FOR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0022)
NO NOT HERE FOR YE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME IN THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0023)
HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND THEY CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0024)
NO OTHER SPEECH CAME FROM HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0025)
AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF THIS TERRIBLE LOSS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0026)
TO WHAT GOD WAS THAT SACRIFICE DUE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0027)
AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER WAS BEFORE HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0028)
I HAVE DRAGGED FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0029)
WHY SHOULD WE NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0030)
AND WHAT A NOBLE THEE IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0031)
HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMES AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0032)
YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0033)
AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WAS HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0034)
SHE IS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0035)
HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I CAN BRING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0036)
THAT I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PAINS ENOUGH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0037)
THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN CROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0038)
HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK WHICH HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0000)
CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE A GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0001)
CHRISTIAN SAID I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0002)
I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE HE WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0003)
HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR ME AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0004)
CHRISTIAN WHAT DID THIS MEAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0005)
THEN HE TOOK HIM INTO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MEN TO SWEEP IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0006)
CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0007)
THEN YOU NEXT SAW A MAID COMING IN TO LAY THE DUST SO YOU SEEM MADE CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0008)
JUST AS TRISTRAM CAME UP TO THE KRAUS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0009)
AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT WINES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0010)
CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLESSED CRY BLESSED TOMB	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0011)
HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS UPON THEIR FEET	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0012)
CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YE GO	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0013)
FROM MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAINGLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZION FOR PRAISE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0014)
KNOW YOU NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0015)
THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG YEARS HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0016)
YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF THAT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0017)
AND IF WE ARE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ARTS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0018)
IT IS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0019)
I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF A HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0020)
NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND WENT UP THE HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0021)
NOW HALF WAY UP WAS THE CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0022)
TIMARU SAID THAT TSING WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0023)
YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD FALL UPON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0024)
YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PIECE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0025)
SHE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0026)
SO HE FELL DOWN UPON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0027)
OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR YEAST THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF FAHILL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0028)
SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0029)
HOW FAR COULD I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0030)
NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SQUIRREL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS COAT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0031)
WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAS GOT BACK HIS SCAW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0032)
HE LAID IT OUT IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0033)
WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLIMB THE HEEL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0034)
HA THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS RANGING THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0035)
THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHED FOR AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0036)
FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE BROUGHT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH NONE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0037)
KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THAT PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0038)
THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE HE WATCHFUL DWELT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0039)
CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE OF THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0040)
WHEN WATCHFOLD TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0041)
THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0042)
HAITI COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU INTO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0043)
WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0044)
PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT THIAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0045)
THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0046)
CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YET I HAVE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0047)
CHARITY AND WHY DO YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0048)
BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE HIM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0049)
THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS UNTIL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0050)
AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JAW BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLAIN AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GALLIATH OF GATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0051)
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAYS CHRISTIAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0052)
THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IN MANIOUS LAND	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0053)
MORE THAN THIS HE HAVE BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0000)
JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE UPON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0001)
THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THERE YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIRRING IN OUR TOWN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0002)
THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LOVE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0003)
COME GOOD HOPEFUL SAID CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0004)
SO WE SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELDS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0005)
HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU THE HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0006)
HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IS FOR OUR GOOD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0007)
CHRISTIAN WE MUST STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0008)
THEN SAID GREY IN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0009)
THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THEY WERE IN FORD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0010)
AND BY THIS ART WE CURE OUR SOULS AS WELL	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0011)
FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0000)
THEREFORE IN THAT STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0001)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD ITS SPATE NOTHING DISMAYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0002)
SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH HOUSES GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0003)
THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM THE PROPERTY OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0004)
NOW WHATEVER IS PART IS PAINTED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0005)
THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0006)
THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAD ORDAINED ALL THIS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0007)
THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD GAVE THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0008)
SO ALL ANIMALS WILL HAVE A BIT MAN OF THEIR OWN CHORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0009)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE SAFE INNOCENCE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0010)
MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD HE HAVE ABATE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0011)
THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAS NO DEMEAN OVER PLANS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0012)
NOW EMMEN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0013)
I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUALITY HAVE BEEN STERILE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0014)
THERE WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0015)
AN EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0016)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0017)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MEN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0018)
IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREEMEN CAN BE CALLED MASTER	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0019)
SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0020)
BUT IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0000)
ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0001)
THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0002)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROGRESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0003)
I HAVE BEEN TOLD MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0000)
AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAS LEFT YOU HELPLESS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0001)
HE LEFT ME THE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0002)
HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAD FALLEN ON US	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0003)
