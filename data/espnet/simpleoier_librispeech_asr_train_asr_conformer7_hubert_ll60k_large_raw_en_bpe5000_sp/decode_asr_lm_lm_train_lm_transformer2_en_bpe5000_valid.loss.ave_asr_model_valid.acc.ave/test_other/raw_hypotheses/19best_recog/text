1688-142285-0000 THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HOARSELY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUESTS DOWN STAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHARP BOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO
1688-142285-0003 I JUST LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS SENTIMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO ARE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY TO HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE WOULD HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME SORT OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 HIS FATHER DYING IN A MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY RESOLVED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PROPORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER IN THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO WORD CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISTER THORNTON IS NOT WONT I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LET MILTON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED SAYS HER FATHER
1688-142285-0016 OH PAPA BY THAT TRUSTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF HER MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES WHICH IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THIS
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WISHES
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS NEGLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING HER ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER OUT YOU CAME
1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO NOT THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0025 AND YOU DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0026 PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND WHAT
1688-142285-0027 I DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANY OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0028 FOR GOOD NIGHT CHILD
1688-142285-0029 THERE WERE STILL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND JACKSON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN HER BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CABIN SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORD BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY MUCH THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THEIR MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO GIVE DISCIPLINE PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MOTHER'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HAGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL GASSY HOW ARE YOU
1688-142285-0038 BETTER AND THE BETTER IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
1688-142285-0039 NOTHING EXACTLY REPLIED MARGARET SMILING
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED O MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND OF BOOLAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FURTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED AROUND TO WALK LONG SIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARDS
1688-142285-0042 BUT AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0043 AT LAST SHE SAID A LOW VOICE
1688-142285-0044 BESSIES DO YOU WISH TO DIE
1688-142285-0045 BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE BEGAN
1688-142285-0046 NOT WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON IT
1688-142285-0047 OR WHAT WAS IT
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I' HAD LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON
1688-142285-0049 I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET
1688-142285-0050 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MIGHT I GO WITH YOU NOW
1688-142285-0051 THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO THE WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AND THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
1688-142285-0053 YOU'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GROOVEISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0054 BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN SHE ENTERED
1688-142285-0055 GASPED TESSY AT LAST
1688-142285-0056 BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK TO SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER THEM AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT TO YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IS
1688-142285-0059 NOW I'LL HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED TOO
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDER WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0061 I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE BUT NO MORE
1688-142285-0062 THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG LADY
1688-142285-0063 I DON'T BELIEVED ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY A BIG DEAL
1688-142285-0064 BUT WHO'S COME AT LAST AND WHO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HE'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON BUT WHO KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT
1688-142285-0065 IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HAND TO WORK
1688-142285-0066 BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLAYED IN THE MORE WITH MARGARET
1688-142285-0067 DON'T THINK HARDLY ON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN
1688-142285-0068 I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE CHOKED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF FATHER IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0069 A FEVERISH COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEKS AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYE
1688-142285-0070 BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FOR YOU SHALL OH MY HEART
1688-142285-0071 SHE PUT HER HAND TO IT AND SEEMED GHASTLY PALE
1688-142285-0072 MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD REST UPON HER BOSOM
1688-142285-0073 PRESENTLY A SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE AND CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
1688-142285-0075 I'LL COME TO MORROW SAID MARGUERITE
1688-142285-0076 MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AND THOUGHTFUL
1688-142285-0077 SHE WAS LATE FOR TEA AT HOME AND
1688-142285-0078 HAVE YOU MET WITH A CERTAIN DEAR
1688-142285-0079 NO MAMMA THAT ANNE BUCKLEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE

2033-164914-0007 AND HE ALSO IMPROVISES THE TWO FOLLOWING DISTICHS
2033-164914-0008 WHEN NUSHAT AL ZAMAN HEARD THE FIRST IMPROVISATIONS SHE CALLED TO MIND HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER AND HER BROTHER AND THEIR WILLYUM HOME THEN SHE WEPT AND CRIED TO THE EUNUCH AND SAID TO HIM WOE TO THEE

2033-164914-0014 BUT THE EUNUCH SAID I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE TILL THOU SHOW ME WHO IT WAS THAT RECITED THESE VERSES FOR I DREAD RETURNING TO MY LADY WITHOUT HIM
2033-164914-0015 NOW WHEN THE FIREMAN HEARD THESE WORDS HE FEARED FOR ZAD AL MAKAN AND WEPT WITH EXCEEDING WEEPING AND SAID TO THE EUNUCH BY ALLAH IT WAS NOT I AND I KNOW HIM NOT

2033-164914-0017 THEN HE KISSED THE EUNUCH'S HEAD AND SPAKE HIM FAIR TILL HE WENT AWAY BUT THE CASTRATO FETCHED HER ROUND AND RETURNING SECRETLY CAME AND STOOD BEHIND THE FIREMAN FEARING TO GO BACK TO HIS MISTRESS WITHOUT TIDINGS
2033-164914-0018 I SAY WHAT MADE MY IGNOMINY WHEREE'ER THE BITTER CUP I DRAIN FAR BE FROM ME THY LAND TO FLEE NOR WILL I BOW TO THOSE WHO BLAME AND FOR SUCH LOVE WOULD DEAL ME SHAME
2033-164914-0019 THEN SAID THE EUNUCH TO ZAUL MAKAN PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY LORD
2033-164914-0020 O MY LORD CONTINUED THE EUNUCH AS SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY

2033-164915-0000 AND NOT SO THESE
2033-164915-0001 THEN SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HE WRAPPED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN FELL DOWN IN A FAINTING FIT
2033-164915-0002 WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW HIS CASE HE WONDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEWHAT TO COVER THEM WAITED UNTIL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
2033-164915-0003 AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND UZNAT AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LEFT HER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THESE VERSES
2033-164915-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANTS HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM BUT HOW HE HAD GOT FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BUYING HOW HE HAD MADE A MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD COME IN TO HER AND HOW THE KING THEIR SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARRKAN
2033-164915-0005 BUT NOW GO TO THOU MASTER AND BRING HIM QUICKLY TO ME
2033-164915-0006 THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED A CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO ACCORDINGLY SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE TALKER TILL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRDING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
2033-164915-0007 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE STALKER GIRDED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING O WOULD THAT I KNEW WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM
2033-164915-0008 I BELIEVE HE HATH DENOUNCED ME TO THE EUNUCH HENCE THESE PAGES ABOUT ME AND HE HATH MADE ME AN ACCOMPLICE IN HIS CRIMES
2033-164915-0009 WHY DIDST THOU SAY I NEVER REPEATED THESE COUPLETS NOR DO I KNOW WHO REPEATED THEM WHEN IT IS THY COMPANION
2033-164915-0010 BUT NOW I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE BETWEEN THIS PLACE AND BAGDAD AND WHAT BETIDETH THY COMMERCE SHALL BETIDE THEE
2033-164915-0011 TWAS AS I FEARED THAT COMING ILLS DISCERNING BUT UNTO ALLAH WE ARE ALL RETURNING
2033-164915-0012 THEN THE EUNUCH CRIED UPON THESE PAGES SAYING TAKE HIM OFF THE ASS
2033-164915-0013 AND HE ANSWERED I AM THE CHAMBERLAIN OF THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS KING SHARRKAN SON OF OMAR BIN AL NUMAN LORD OF VAJDAD AND OF THE LAND OF KHORASAN AND I BRING TRIBUTE AND PRESENTS FROM HIM TO HIS FATHER IN BAGDAD
2033-164915-0014 SO FARE YE FORWARDS NO HARM SHALL BEFALL YOU TILL YOU JOIN HIS GRAND WAZIR CANDAN
2033-164915-0015 THEN HE BADE THEM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO KING OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND THE TRIBUTE OF SYRIA
2033-164915-0016 SO IT WAS AGREED THAT WE GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARRKAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHERS REALM
2033-164915-0017 AND AMONGST THEM WERE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE CADET ZAU AL MAKAN FOR QUOTH THEY HIS NAME BE LIGHT OF THE PLACE AND HE HATH A SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HIGH IS THE DELIGHT OF THE TIME BUT THEY SET OUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOR AL HIJAZ AND NONE WOTTETH WHAT IS BECOME OF THEM
2033-164916-0000 SO HE TURNED TO THE WAZIR DENDAN AND SAID TO HIM VERILY YOUR TALE IS A WONDER OF WONDERS
2033-164916-0001 KNOW O CHIEF WAZIR THAT HERE WHERE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED ME ALLAH HATH GIVEN YOU REST FROM FATIGUE AND BRINGETH YOU YOUR DESIRE AFTER THE EASIEST OF FASHIONS FOR THAT HIS ALMIGHTY WILL RESTORETH TO YOU ZAUMA KHAN AND HIS SISTER NUSHAT AL ZAMAN WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN
2033-164916-0002 WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAYNE TELL ME THE TALE OF THAT TWAIN AND WHAT BEFELL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
2033-164916-0003 ZALA KHAN BOWED HIS HEAD A WHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THE POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELLED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM ON THE RIGHT WAY
2033-164916-0004 THEN HE ADDED O MY UNCLE HOW SHALL I DO WITH MY BROTHERS SHARRKAN
2033-164916-0005 AFTER A WHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE BULL TIDE SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
2033-164916-0006 WHEN IT WAS THE SEVENTY EIGHTH NIGHT I
2033-164916-0007 AND IN IT ALL REJOICED AT THE ACCESSION OF THE LIGHT OF THE SUN
2033-164916-0008 LASTLY THE MINISTER WENT IN AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE ZAUNT MAKAN WHO ROSE TO MEET HIM SAYING WELCOME O WAZIR AND SIRE'S SONSPIER
2033-164916-0009 MOREOVER THE SULTAN COMMANDED HIS WAZIR DUNDAN TO CALL A TEN DAYS HALT OF THE ARMY THAT HE MIGHT BE PRIVATE WITH HIM AND LEARN FROM HIM HOW AND WHEREFORE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN SLAIN
2033-164916-0010 HE THEN REPAIRED TO THE HEART OF THE ENCAMPMENTS AND ORDERED THE HOST TO HALT TEN DAYS
2414-128291-0000 WHAT HATH HAPPENED UNTO
2414-128291-0001 HE ASKED HIMSELF SOMETHING WARM AND LIVING QUICKENETH ME IT MUST BE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
2414-128291-0002 WHEN HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA WAS QUITE NIGH UNTO THEM THEN DID HE HEAR PLAINLY THAT A HUMAN VOICE SPAKE IN THE MIDST OF THE CAIN AND APPARENTLY ALL OF THEM HAD TURNED THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THE SPEAKER

2414-128292-0005 VERILY MY FOLLY HAD GROWN DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS

2414-128292-0016 THE DEVIL HIMSELF IS PERHAPS INCLINED
2414-128292-0017 SOMETIMES I MEANT TO GO AND BEHOLD
2414-128292-0018 THEN ONLY DID I HEAR THE TRUTH
2414-128292-0019 OH HAVE I STILL INCLINATION
2414-128292-0020 HAVE I STILL A BOY
2414-128292-0021 A RAVEN TOWARDS WHICH MY SAIL IS SET

2414-128292-0023 O ETERNAL EVERY WHERE O ETERNAL NOWHERE OH ETERNAL IN VAIN
2414-128292-0024 THOU WHO ART MY SHADOW
2414-128292-0025 SAID HE AT LAST SADLY OH
2414-128292-0026 THY DANGER IS NOT SMALL THOU FREES SPIRIT AND WANDERER
2414-128292-0027 THEY SPEAK QUIETLY THEY ENJOY THEIR NEW SECURITY
2414-128292-0028 BEWARE LEST IN THE END A NARROW FAITH CAPTURE THEE A HARD RIGOROUS DERISION
2414-128292-0029 FOR NOW SOMETHING THAT IS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTETH THEE
2414-128292-0030 THOU HAST LOST THY GOAD
2414-128292-0031 THOU POOR ROVER AND RAMBLER THOU TIRED BUTTERFLIE
2414-128292-0032 WILT THOU HAVE A REST ON A HOME THIS EVENING
2414-159411-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAHMIN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN CUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM
2414-159411-0001 THE BRAHMIN ANSWERED NO I WOULD NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THE CAGE YOU WILL EAT ME
2414-159411-0002 O FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN FRIGHT THAT I WILL NOT
2414-159411-0003 I WILL NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND REMAIN
2414-159411-0004 THEN THE BRAHMIN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE TURNED THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARDS
2414-159411-0005 SO THE BRAHMIN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A BANNANT TREE AND THE BRAHMIN SAID TO IT BANNANT TREE BANNANT TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0006 ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE BANDON TREE
2414-159411-0007 THIS TIGER SAID THE BAMIN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF HIS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LEFT HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME
2414-159411-0008 IT IS JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NOTHING
2414-159411-0009 LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MEN WERE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE
2414-159411-0010 SIR CAMEL SIR CAMEL CRIED THE BRAHMAN HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENTS
2414-159411-0011 AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND A BULLOCK LYING AT THE ROADSIDE
2414-159411-0012 IS IT FAIRE THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NOT
2414-159411-0013 LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR WE HAVE NO PITY
2414-159411-0014 THREE OUT OF THE SIX AND GIVEN JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMIN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINE TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
2414-159411-0015 ON WHAT SHALL I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE EAGLE
2414-159411-0016 THEN THE BRAHMIN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONES
2414-159411-0017 THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID JUDGE OF ALL IS AGAINST YOU O BRAHMAN
2414-159411-0018 AFTER THIS THEY SAW THE ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMIN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE VERDICT
2414-159411-0019 BUT THE ALLIGATORS SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MEN LAMENT ME AND TRY TO KILL ME
2414-159411-0020 THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE ATTENTION OF THE SIXTH JUDGE
2414-159411-0021 SO THE SIXTH WAS A JACKAL
2414-159411-0022 THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKO UNCLE JACAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0023 SHOW ME THE HOUSE
2414-159411-0024 THEN THE GUARD THERE THE JAKALS SAID NOW BRAHMIN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD
2414-159411-0025 DIRECTLY THERE WAS IT ASKED THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0026 EXACTLY IT REPLIED THE BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0027 WHEN WAS A TIGER THEN
2414-159411-0028 WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE TEACHER JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON THIS SIDE
2414-159411-0029 VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL BUT I NOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY
2414-159411-0030 SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE BRAMINS
2414-159411-0031 THEN SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE JACKALS
2414-159411-0032 WHEN THE BRAMINS HAD DONE THIS THE JACKALS SAID OH YOU WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL TIGER
2414-159411-0033 WHEN THE GOOD BRAHMIN OPENED YOUR CARRIAGE DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WOULD MAKE
2414-159411-0034 PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEY FRED BRAHMAN
2414-159411-0035 YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY AND MIND HIS
2414-165385-0000 THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUET AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLATTERING PACON BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILIZED MONKEY
2414-165385-0001 THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS STRANGED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMIC WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU
2609-156975-0000 THEN MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS UNKNOWN
2609-156975-0001 HOWDORNE HOPHAST HODOUBT PAINS SINCE HIS GENIUS
2609-156975-0002 LET'S HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MATRON MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET'S DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTOOD IT LINCOLN
2609-156975-0003 THE EGYPTIAN CAMPAIGN OF THE BONDAGE
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHOSE TURBANT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KIERNAATPATH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST PABLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIANS AND SCRIPZONS GIVE OF THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF OUR DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ALTAMI CALVETTES INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES PROSELY TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDAH WERE THE CHIEF FACTORS IN ITS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
2609-156975-0008 THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES GENERALLY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATION OF THE SOJOURN IN EGYPT
2609-156975-0009 THE LATER TRADITIONS CENTERED THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAMES OF THE CITY PATAM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATUM
2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY IN SCRIPS AND ULSTERS STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHAM THE HOUSE OF RAMESES A CITY WITH THE ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES
2609-156975-0012 THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THE SYRANNY WAS NATURALLY INEVITABLE
2609-156975-0013 WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM IT THE DESPOTIC ROAR OF THE LAND IN DAY
2609-156975-0014 THE MAKING OF A LORD PATRIOT
2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES'S BIRTH AND EARLIEST CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
2609-156975-0016 WHERE'S MOSES JUST FINDIN RESISTIN THE GYPSY TACT MASTER
2609-156975-0017 IS PENALAGE ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
2609-156975-0018 NAT'REE YE WENT TO THE LAND O MIDIAN
2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR THE EGYPTIANS AND FUGITIVES
2609-156975-0020 FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND C
2609-156975-0021 ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND THE BEDOUIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
2609-156975-0022 THESE SAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KADAM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO A COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN THAT TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0024 THAT SCORE OF THE WEARINESS
2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSE VERY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUATE
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIEST OF THE SUBTRIBE OF THE CANNITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOUSE AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0027 NOTE THE CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF MATTERS
2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARNT THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT IN WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KINITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YA'WAY OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GUIDE WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0031 DO THE EARLIEST SHEBREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0032 THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST WAS MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0033 MOSES IN THE HOUSE OF THE MIDIAN PRIEST WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0034 THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT WHICH HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
2609-156975-0035 HIS QUEST WAS FOR A JUTS AND STRONG GANG ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRSTS DEEPENS HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON THE POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST AND TONIAN PLAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA MINOR SYRIL CALLED EVERY LIFE GIVEN SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
2609-156975-0038 THIS CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES'S CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTION
2609-157645-0000 EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PRESENT FOR THE ROYAL FOE AT TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
2609-157645-0001 THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGUISING QUOD AT THE SMOKIN IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
2609-157645-0002 SOMETIMES TOBACCO IS USED IN CHURCH FOR DISINFECTANTS OR DEODORIZING PURPOSES
2609-157645-0003 BLACKBURN ARTS BICEP OF YORK WAS THE GREAT SMOKER
2609-157645-0004 ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH DININGHAM FOR A CONFORM MASON
2609-157645-0005 ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER DADNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTERY AT HATTON
2609-157645-0006 PAR WAS SUCH A CONTINUOUS SMOKER THAT ANY ONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HADN'T NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENSE
2609-157645-0007 ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITSFIELD HE HANDED MASTER PIPE AND JOSTLEER THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING EM PATIENT
2609-157645-0008 THEM THEM SING ANOTHER PSALM SAYS THE CURATE
2609-157645-0009 THEY HAVE SIR CRIED THE CLERK
2609-157645-0010 THEN LET ME SING THE HUNDRED AND NINETEENTH REPLIED THE CURATE
2609-157645-0011 SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START WITH AS MANY TOBACCO PIPES AS TO THE MAN OF OFFICE
2609-157645-0012 DAVID DEANE SAVOR DENIED THE AWE PROVED THIS IRREVERENCE
2609-157645-0013 GOING TO CHURCH SAINT HALE'S IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN A QUAINT AND THE SIGNING EXPERIENCE
2609-157645-0014 WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND OUT I WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOMS THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
2609-169640-0000 PARROTS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY THE SCEPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE SEEST FOUR OF THEM FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACT OF VIOLENCE
2609-169640-0001 AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JEST KEPT THE STEERAGE WAY ON THE SHIP
2609-169640-0002 FORTUNATELY THE JOHN WAS NOT ONLY FAT BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS THE LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS IN UNLIVERY DANCE
2609-169640-0003 I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SIP PO'S HE SPECTS YOU IN MODERATE WEATHER
2609-169640-0004 MISTER MARBLE HE I DO B'LIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HINCOOPS BEIN LIKE THE SAILORS AS ONE MIGHT SAY PERRY ASLEEP
2609-169640-0005 AT THIS MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE WHEN FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN THE BOAT
2609-169640-0006 I SING UP SAIL HO AND CLOSE ABOARD
2609-169640-0007 AND HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
2609-169640-0008 ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET IN OUR TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
2609-169640-0009 AS OUR SEATS WERE HALF LYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME LEASURE TO LOOK ABOUT
2609-169640-0010 I SOON SAW BOTH BRONTZ AND QUIET ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER
2609-169640-0011 MISTER KITE OBSERVED THAT ALSO AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCAL'S ABACK
2609-169640-0012 A BRAVE STILLNESS SUCCEEDED
2609-169640-0013 THE PROATES DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED AS FAST
2609-169640-0014 I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING BLOCKS TOO AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
2609-169640-0015 KAIN WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
2609-169640-0016 THE STILLNESS THAT WEIGHED ON BOTH SIDES WAS LIKE THAT OF DEATH
2609-169640-0017 THE GUIDE BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME ROUND LIKE A TAP
2609-169640-0018 THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER SHE COULD PASS THEM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
2609-169640-0019 THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INCIDENT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE IN THE CLOSEST SENTENCES TO HIS ORDERS
2609-169640-0020 NOT A SOUL ON BOARD OF THE JOHN WAS HURT
2609-169640-0021 ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMEN THE FOUR SIXES TWO AT THE NEAREST AND TWO IN THE STERNMOST PROWA WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
2609-169640-0022 THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN OUTRAGES
2609-169640-0023 I DOUBT IF WE'D TOUCH A MAN IN THE NEAREST PARA
2609-169640-0024 IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD OF HER CANVAS'S BINNED FORE LEAVING THE PROW A MOSTNOUS IN HER WAKE
3005-163389-0000 THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHIRBURNE'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK FOR THE NOISE
3005-163389-0001 SOME SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEAR DOWN DOWN THE FENCE
3005-163389-0002 THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY AND UNCERTAIN
3005-163389-0003 SHERWIN RUN HIS EYES SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUTGAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
3005-163389-0004 THE AVERAGE MAN'S A SCOUNDREL
3005-163389-0005 BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE MAN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARK AND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
3005-163389-0006 SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH A HUNDRED MASKED CROWDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
3005-163389-0007 WHO DIDN'T WANT TO COME
3005-163389-0008 BUT A MOB WITHOUT ANY A MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT IS BENEATH PITIFULNESS
3005-163389-0009 NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN UP AGAINST HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS THIS
3005-163389-0010 THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AN THEN BROKE ALL APART AN WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AND BUCK HARKNESS HE HEALED IT AFTER THEM LOOKING INTOLERABLE CHEAP
3005-163389-0011 BUT YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
3005-163389-0012 THEY ARGUED AND TRIED TO KEEP IT OUT BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE WHOLE SHOW COME TO A STANDSTILL
3005-163389-0013 AND THE ONE OR TWO WOMEN BEGAN TO SCREAM
3005-163389-0014 SO THEN THE RING MASTER HE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY UPON THE HORSE
3005-163389-0015 IT WARN'T FUNNY TO ME THOUGH I WAS ALL OF A TREMBLE TO SEE HIS WONDER
3005-163389-0016 AND THE HORSE IS GOIN LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE TOO
3005-163389-0017 HE SHED EM SO THICK THEY KIND OF CLOGGED UP THE AIR AND ALTOGETHER HE SHED SEVENTEEN SUIT
3005-163389-0018 BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF HIS OWN MEN
3005-163390-0000 AN BUT NEVER MIND THE REST OF HIS OUTFIT IT WAS JES WILD BUT IT WAS AWFUL FUNNY
3005-163390-0001 THE PEOPLE MOST KILLED THEMSELVES LAUGHING AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE CAPERING AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HAWED TILL HE COME BACK AND DONE IT OVER AGAIN BUT AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM DO IT ANOTHER TIME
3005-163390-0002 TWENTY PEOPLE THINKS OUT

3005-163399-0013 PERTY SOON SHE MADE THE COLD CHILL STREAK ALL DOWN MY BACK BECAUSE SHE SAYS
3005-163399-0014 I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEAD I'VE GOT TO THROW UP MY HANDS
3005-163399-0015 SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I GOT TO WSK THE TRUTH
3005-163399-0016 I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE IT COMES
3005-163399-0017 CHILDREN DON'T YOU SAY A THING
3005-163399-0018 I SEE HE WAS IN A FIX NOW
3005-163399-0019 MISSUS PHELPS SHE JUMPS FOR HIM HE SAYS
3005-163399-0020 HAS IT COME NO SAYS HER HUSBAND
3005-163399-0021 I CAN'T IMAGINE SAYS THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MAKES ME DREADFUL UNEASY
3005-163399-0022 UNEASY SHE SAYS I'M READY TO GO DISTRACTING
3005-163399-0023 HE MUST HA COME AN YOU'VE MISSED EM ALONG DE ROAD
3005-163399-0024 OH DON'T DISTRESS ME ANY MORE'N I'M ALREADY DISTRESS'D
3005-163399-0025 WHY SILAS LOOK YONDER UP THE ROAD AIN'T THAT SOME BODY COMING
3005-163399-0026 THE OLD GENTLEMAN STARED AND WAS
3005-163399-0027 I HAIN'T NO IDEA WHO IS HERE
3005-163399-0028 IS THAT TOM SAWYER
3005-163399-0029 BING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEARD A STEAMBOAT COUGHIN ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
3005-163399-0030 THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES DOWN ON THEIR BOAT
3080-5032-0000 BUT I AM RICHLY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MY LADY
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE ONE LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN BUT THE WORST OF HER
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER NATURE AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
3080-5032-0003 WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND OF GARLAND
3080-5032-0004 WELL THE BEST UPON'T IS THAT I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO HOLY AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGEST
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITHA AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT WERE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
3080-5032-0008 TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO KEEP IT
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS A SQUIRE OF DANE'S AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANY BODY MAY PRETEND TO SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0010 I SUPPOSE MY YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH HIM
3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUT THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM SUDDENLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IT IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOUR FIGHTS AND HAVE HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0014 BUT PRESENTLY I CAN GIVE YOU OTHERS
3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH YOUR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0016 YOU WILL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF HE BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY TAKE IT
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANYONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMORS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBOURS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE SEEN IN UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU HE SHOULD HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NO BODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE THAT MUCH MORE CALMLY
3080-5032-0024 BUT BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARNED IT SINCE
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM JACK MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETERS
3080-5032-0026 NOW KINDLY DO I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHERS IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
3080-5040-0000 WOULD IT BUT LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GRAVE BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SEE FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMASH
3080-5040-0003 I WONDER HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN HE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE ON BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC BUILDING TO BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FEEL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY ALTHOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTERS TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
3080-5040-0008 MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGONE THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE SHEED
3080-5040-0009 YOU SEE I DO GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING
3080-5040-0010 BY THE NEXT I SHALL BE GONE INTO KENT AND MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR INTERCOURSE SO MUCH

3080-5040-0012 I TOLD YOU IN MY LAST THAT MY SUFFOLK JOURNEY WAS LAID ASIDE AND THAT INTO KENTHURST

3080-5040-0014 INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS COMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUDGE FOR A MOST EXCELLENT PERSON AND FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE
3080-5040-0015 BECAUSE I FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT INTEND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
3080-5040-0016 I DO NOT FIND THAT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVED ME
3080-5040-0017 BUT I AM CALLED DOWN
3080-5040-0018 DEMANDED FOR YOUR MASTER
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHID WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN YOU
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS TO THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING IT
3080-5040-0021 YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE AND THIS THAT I ESCAPE DROWNING
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WRITE BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CAN NOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0023 HOW GRATEFUL YOU WILL BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MIGHT LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGHED TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSER
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS WHEN WE GET TIME
3080-5040-0027 WHILE IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM
3080-5040-0028 WILL YOU NOT BE SO GOOD NATURED
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS THE FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW AND HAD A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THUS WITH DISCOURSES OF THE FAMILY OR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER OCCASION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS AFTER AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD MAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASE CART WITH NINE PEAS IN IT UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PAIL INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
3331-159605-0001 THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MORE CREDIT YOU
3331-159605-0002 I'VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST BECAUSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES
3331-159605-0004 WHAT A SHAMEFUL THING I AM
3331-159605-0005 I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME BUT I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 BUT LET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN
3331-159605-0007 HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE HE HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THIS WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREAT INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL AND MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO BILLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY SHE HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLUTTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON AND WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
3331-159605-0014 POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF A LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN THE GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BACKY AND BESS BUT COULD NOT RESIST STOPPING AT THE STORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FANNY THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A BOOK BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASSA CHARLEY'S HAND MISS MAMMIE AND WALK PRETTY LIKE BILLY AND FLOSSIE SAID THE MATE
3331-159605-0019 AT THE STREET CORNER THE BLACK EYED SCHOOLBOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD REALLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS VERY PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE ROSES ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRANKNESS WAS SO ADMIRABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNEW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOESN'T IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0025 THANK YOU SO
3331-159605-0026 HOW LOVELY THE PARK IS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY INSTANTLY FELL
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR MAGGIE'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
3331-159605-0029 SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BUOYANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL DAYS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WILD LIKE LEVERILY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD MET HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVORITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THAT WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 WORKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL BUT'S THE TRUTH WITH YOU
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS SHE'LL CHILD HIM
3331-159605-0035 UTTERLY DONE IN AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PODDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT ARABS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAVE NOT HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0038 DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO GO
3331-159605-0039 TRULY JULIE FANG
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT THAT HE DID
3331-159605-0041 THEN I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
3331-159605-0042 I JUST GAVE HIM AN HINT AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO DON'T THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT SIDDY TATTLES SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHANDLAIMAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT POLLY THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0046 I'M ODD YOU KNOW AND APT TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED FIRST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WHITEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLEED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS WHICH MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER COULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MAN NEVER DO TELL ALL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NO I AM ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DARK WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU ARE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF IT WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0008 THANK HEAVEN OF THAT
3331-159609-0009 CRIED POLLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HIS VOICE
3331-159609-0010 POOR MARY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELL TALE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE THUNDERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKINGLY AND I KNEW IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS MISTER
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER IN ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATED THEIR RESPECTIVE VERBS WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I SUPPOSE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID KATY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRED AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF A SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT MORNING FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF PENNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SIDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE A HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OF A BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHOPS
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDER AT IT MOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBING IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 FANNY CAME STALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORKBASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND CLEVER THAN ANY WE READ
3528-168656-0000 SHE HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE HER REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS A PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR THAT SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUTEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUCEBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOLGIRL WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS THAT MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A COUNTRY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF PONTREVALE DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0006 HE WOULD NOT SHOW THIS OBJECT TO ANY ONE
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED AT THE CONVENT
3528-168656-0008 SOME SUCH UNIQUE CHAPLET SOME AUTHENTIC RELIC
3528-168656-0009 THEN LOST THEMSELVES IN CONJECTURES
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THIS POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY FOR THE DANCER IS LAUGHING WITH A SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0012 MORAL LOVE CONQUERED BY THE COLICK
3528-168669-0000 THE PRIORESS RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HER BED
3528-168669-0001 WE WILL PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOG WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0002 FATHER HAUENT
3528-168669-0003 REVEREND MOTHER DO YOU THINK THE CHAPEL
3528-168669-0004 AND YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF THEIR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
3528-168669-0005 THERE IS A STONE TO BE RAISED HIGH
3528-168669-0006 THIS SLAP OF A PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0007 THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT NOW
3528-168669-0008 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR ONE
3528-168669-0009 BUT A WOMAN IS NEVER A MAN
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DAME BABYLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLONUS HORSES ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERLANUS HOSES NEITHER DO I
3528-168669-0011 MARRIAGE CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCKARD
3528-168669-0012 AND A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THROUGH
3528-168669-0013 AND CAN YOU GO A LEVER
3528-168669-0014 THERE IS A RING IN THE STREET
3528-168669-0015 I WILL PUT THE LEVER INTO IT
3528-168669-0016 THAT WAS GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I WILL OPEN THE VAULT
3528-168669-0017 AND WILL THAT BE ALL NO
3528-168669-0018 GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS FOR REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0019 LOUVENT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
3528-168669-0020 I AM HERE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WISH TO
3528-168669-0021 AND TO HOLD YOUR PEACE ABOUT EVERYTHING YES RAVENED MOTHER
3528-168669-0022 WHEN THE VEIL IS OPEN I WILL CLOSE IT AGAIN
3528-168669-0023 BUT BEFORE THAT WHEN REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0024 FATHER VAUVIN REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0025 YOU SAY THAT A MOTHER DIED THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0026 NO DID YOU NOT HEAR THE BALL
3528-168669-0027 NOTHING CAN BE HEARD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN YET
3528-168669-0028 AND THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN MY DIRECTION THIS MOMENT
3528-168669-0029 IT WAS THE MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN LITTLE CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER AH
3528-168669-0031 THE MOTHER'S HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW
3528-168669-0032 A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE NEXT ROOM MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0033 HE AND MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0034 WHERE DO YOU SAY
3528-168669-0035 I SAY MORE OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
3528-168669-0036 REVEREND MOTHER I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT I SAID VERY OFTEN
3528-168669-0037 BUT I DID NOT SAY NO OFTEN
3528-168669-0038 AT THAT MOMENT NINE O'CLOCK BROKE
3528-168669-0039 AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT ALL HOURS PRAISED AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR SAID THE PRYRESS
3528-168669-0040 IT CUT VERY OFTEN SHORT

3528-168669-0042 IN HER LIFETIME MOTHER CRUCIFIXION MADE CONVERTS AFTER HER DEATH SHE WILL PERFORM MIRACLES AS SHE WILL
3528-168669-0043 FATHER FAUVIN THAT COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0044 SHE RETAINED HER ENTHUSIASM TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT
3528-168669-0045 AND SHE GAVE US HER LAST COMMANDS
3528-168669-0046 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HERSEL SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEGS MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0047 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN PARADISE IN THAT DEATH
3528-168669-0048 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS AN ORISON WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING
3528-168669-0049 FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE SHE RAN ON
3528-168669-0050 I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABOURING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUITS
3528-168669-0051 FORTUNATELY THE PRIORESS IMMEDIATELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT

3528-168669-0069 SHE ASKED IT OF US THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDED ME

3528-168669-0130 YOU WILL MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR WAS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO USE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DESTROY THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP THE FINGERS INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY A SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOUND TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY IS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN NINETY FOUR
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH WAY AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE GENERALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FOR THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND RETURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHITES ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMS OR FRUIT PASTE ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY HAVE PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT UP AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN IT IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN O TEN
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICET TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUASINE
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER AS THEY CAN NOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS AND
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND SILVER DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 ISI
3538-142836-0024 AT DESSERTS OR AT ALL EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE SPATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND PLAIN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO WORK INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE WITH THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 SO HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME GIRL SAID THE HAT
3538-163619-0004 AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THIS SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THE YOUTH PROMISE TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME AT SIGHT OF LAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S FATHER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 THAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR BUT THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT OF THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL CALL TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY TEN FOALS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOURS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HASST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT I SHALL SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 THEY HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS WIFE
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTIFF THAT SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB OUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKE THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON THE LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SYDDE LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO OTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDER LADD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID SINDER LADY
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDER LADD
3538-163622-0014 AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARD THE LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOOL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANY THING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT WAS WHITE SAID SINDER LAD
3538-163622-0017 IT SEEMED LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SINDERLAT TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SEE EVERYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW ENQUIRED THE FOAL SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FOIL DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOAM AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST RETURNED SINDER LAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS ALONE
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT BACK AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER IT MIGHT BE HEALED
3538-163624-0003 SO I ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND SHOW THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU SHOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CUT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE THING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REGAN GOT A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BED AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGURD SAID THAT THE SWORD WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN THEY SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 THEN SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT AS BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 NOT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FAFNER AND THEN STAFFOR DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFFNER'S HEART AND LET THEM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNER OF A STEAK AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRIMHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND CRY FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE PUT THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 AND SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 LYNN BRUNHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUNDON WERE BATHING BRUNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRON'S SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLESH WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BRITISH SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
367-130732-0000 BUT LOBSTERS AND LOBSTERS
367-130732-0001 WHEN IS A LOBSTER TO A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION IN ANSWER MAY WELL GO INTO THE PRIMARY OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE NOTHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN
367-130732-0004 A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN OF THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD WIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER ELLE NEUBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DOMINICO

367-130732-0010 KING OF SHELL
367-130732-0011 ONE HAS HAD TO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO TO PARTAKE OF THE KING OF SHELLFISH THE MAMMOTH PACIFIC CRAB
367-130732-0012 I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COAST AND IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUSLY AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
367-130732-0013 GOBY'S PASSED WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF THE WIDOW IN UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBIES OF BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PRESTIGE DO NOT DESCEND TO HER
367-130732-0015 GORBY'S CRAB STEW
367-130732-0016 THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT ALL THE FAT FROM THE SHELL

367-130732-0022 SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE HOFF BROW HAS BEEN MAKING A SPECIALTY OF THEM
367-130732-0023 ALL THE BETTER CLASSED RESTAURANTS HOWEVER WILL SERVE THEM IF YOU ORDER THEM
367-130732-0024 THIS WAS THE RECIPE FOR EIGHT PEOPLE AND IT IS WELL WORTH TRYING IF YOU ARE GIVING A DINNER OF IMPORTANCE

367-293981-0008 MAN CAN SPEAK TOO SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT THAT IS NOT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT WHAT WE SEE IS THE ENCHANTED MOOR
367-293981-0009 THE GOVERNOR TURNED TO HIM AND SAID WELL HOW GOES IT GOOD MAN
367-293981-0010 SANCHO GOT UP WITH PAIN ENOUGH IN HIS BONES AND WENT AFTER THE INNKEEPER IN THE DARK AND MEETING THE OFFICER WHO WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIS ENEMY HE SAID TO HIM SENOR WHOEVER YOU ARE DO US THE FAVOUR AND KINDNESS TO GIVE US A LITTLE ROSEMARY OIL SALT AND WINE FOR IT IS WANTED TO CURE ONE OF OUR BEST KNIGHTS ERRANT ON EARTH WHO LIES IN YONDER BED WOUNDED BY THE HANDS OF THE ENCHANTED MOOR THAT IS IN THIS INN
367-293981-0011 TO BE BRIEF HE TOOK THE MATERIALS OF WHICH HE HAD MADE A COMPOUND MIXING THEM ALL AND BOILING THEM A GOOD WHILE UNTIL IT SEEMED TO HIM THEY HAD COME TO PERFECTION
367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE PISCAN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED IT DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY LITTLE LESS FROM HIS MASTER
367-293981-0014 IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT RETURNED SANCHO WOE BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KINDRED WHY SHOULD YOU LET ME TASTE IT
367-293981-0015 SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THIS KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU BY AN ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOU SATISFACTION AND REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRE
367-293981-0016 THEN THIS IS NO INN SAID DON QUIXOTE
367-293981-0017 IT A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE SAID THE INNKEEPER
367-293981-0018 THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLANKETED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW VENTURE WAS COMING TILL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS SQUIRE WHO UTTERED THEM
367-293981-0019 HE SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF YOU WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
367-293981-0020 SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT INTO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THE BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
3764-168670-0000 THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLES GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
3764-168670-0001 COSETTE HAD WAKED BACK
3764-168670-0002 JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED HER NEAR THE FIRE AND
3764-168670-0003 YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE I COME TO FETCH YOU
3764-168670-0004 EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENTLY
3764-168670-0005 I HAVE PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE FOUND OUT
3764-168670-0006 THAT'S WHERE HIS DIFFICULTY LIES
3764-168670-0007 IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THE CHILD YOU WILL CARRY IT OUT
3764-168670-0008 AND SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUES I ANSWER FOR THAT
3764-168670-0009 FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO GIL VALJEAN
3764-168670-0010 YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL MANAGE IT
3764-168670-0011 JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RAVEN
3764-168670-0012 FAUCHELEVENTENT WENT ON
3764-168670-0013 IT IS A TO MORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECTS YOU
3764-168670-0014 THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR THAT SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE COMMUNITY
3764-168670-0015 THERE THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
3764-168670-0016 THAT THE PRIORESS AND THE VOCAL MOTHERS INTENDED TO FULFILL THE WISHES OF THE DECEASED
3764-168670-0017 THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THE CELL RAISE THAT STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
3764-168670-0018 AND THEN THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER THIS EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0019 WHAT IS THAT HEAVY COFFIN
3764-168670-0020 ASKED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENTS REPLIED
3764-168670-0021 WHAT COFFIN WHAT ADMINISTRATION'
3764-168670-0022 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER HIS CHAIR I
3764-168670-0023 YOU KNOW FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IS SAID
3764-168670-0024 AND I ADD BUT FATHER MADELEINE IS BURIED R
3764-168670-0025 YOU YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN FATHER MADELEINE
3764-168670-0026 THIS OFFERS THE MEANS GIVE ME SOME EXPLANATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
3764-168670-0027 HOW LONG IS THE COFFIN IN SIX FEET
3764-168670-0028 IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOWS OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH WHAT CHURCH
3764-168670-0029 THE CHURCH IN THE STREET FOR THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
3764-168670-0030 HAVE YE THE KEYS TO THOSE TWO DOORS
3764-168670-0031 NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THAT CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKERS MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME AND GET THE COFFIN
3764-168670-0033 WE NAILS UP THE COFFIN I DO
3764-168670-0034 WHO SPREADS THE PAUGH OVER IT
3764-168670-0035 NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM IT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
3764-168670-0036 COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THIS ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN EVERYONE IS ASLEEP
3764-168670-0037 ABOUT THE THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3764-168670-0038 I SHALL BE HUNGRY SO I WILL BRING YOU SOMETHING
3764-168670-0039 YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP IN THE CABIN AT TWO O'CLOCK
3764-168670-0040 FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS FINGER JOINTS BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
3764-168670-0041 BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER TO DRIVE SOME NAILS IN A PLANK
3764-168670-0042 JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN MORE STRAITS THAN THIS
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPES
3764-168670-0044 WHAT DOES THAT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A CURE
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR YEARS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK CON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0047 A MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE AND
3764-168670-0048 WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO A CAT DON COME IN
3764-168670-0049 THE OVERPRUDENT CATS AND THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
3764-168670-0050 WHEN JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
3764-168670-0052 AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN HIS GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0053 I SHALL FOLLOW THAT AS MY BUSINESS
3764-168670-0054 THE HORSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN KNOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0055 THE PRIEST SAYS A PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE MAY NOT BE SOBER
3764-168670-0057 THAT WAS SETTLED FATHER FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL GO WELL
3764-168671-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAININ PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEARS
3764-168671-0001 THIS HEARSE CONTAINS A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
3764-168671-0002 A MORNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN ITS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
3764-168671-0003 BEHIND HER CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABORER WHO LIMPED ALONG
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING AND IN SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THAT SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES
3764-168671-0006 DAMPNESS IS INVADING IT THE FLOWERS WERE DESERTING IT
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VOJERGS IT HINTED AT POVERTY PER LA CHAISE IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHEZ IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0009 THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN INTO THE DEAD WOMAN ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENCE IN OUR SIGHT
3764-168671-0010 IT IS ONE OF THEIR FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE A DUTY
3764-168671-0011 THE NUNS HAD RECOGNIZED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
3764-168671-0012 IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0013 MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MADAM BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES
3764-168671-0014 A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PERSON
3764-168671-0015 FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE AT A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0016 JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSTURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0017 WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING AND
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESS
3764-168671-0019 HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE LET HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
3764-168671-0020 THE PRINCIPLE FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A BASKET WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0022 THE MAN FOUND THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0023 THE GRAVEDIGER YES
3764-168671-0024 ARE YOU I
3764-168671-0025 FATHER ESTIENNE WAS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
3764-168671-0026 FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS BUT A BRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE
3764-168671-0027 IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GREAT DIGGERS DO DIE THEMSELVES
3764-168671-0028 HE HAD HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STAMMER AND
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER MASCHIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LENOY IS HERE'S A JUG OF RED WINE
3764-168671-0031 BUT YOU'RE A SILLY FELLOW TOO
3764-168671-0032 ARE YOU NOT TIRED WE'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
3764-168671-0033 THE OLD MAN REPLIED
3764-168671-0034 HE LIMPED MORE OUT OF ANXIETY THAN TO INFIRMITY
3764-168671-0035 THE GRAVE DIGGER WALKED ON IN FRONT OF
3764-168671-0036 FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED CREVELLE ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A FAMILIAR SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER HE MUTTERED
3764-168671-0038 YES SIR FATHER MATHIER IS DEAD
3764-168671-0039 THE MAN REPLIED GREATLY
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTEBOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MESTIENNE'S TURN FATHER MESTHIERNE DIED
3764-168671-0041 AND STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT IT IS MADE
3764-168671-0042 YOU ARE A HUSBAND I AM A PARISIAN
3764-168671-0043 FAUCHELEVENT WHAT I AM LOST
3764-168671-0044 THERE WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL JUST FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUN'S CORNER
3764-168671-0045 AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS DOING A PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED THE SPEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE TRITANNIUM TOWN HALL
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A POPULAR WRITER
3764-168671-0049 SO YOU IS NOT A GRAVE DIGGER THEN
3764-168671-0050 RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS AND
3764-168671-0051 HERE HIS REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY
3764-168671-0052 FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF AT ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053 THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH A CURIOUS SMILE
3764-168671-0054 THE ONE MUST EAT
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY EVENING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHICH
3997-180294-0002 OH DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR WRETCHE
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE AS IF I DO
3997-180294-0005 I GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD OFTEN ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING A SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST SIGNAL OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS NO FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY TELL IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VEIL
3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FINGERS
3997-180294-0011 THEY LOVE BY PROFESSION AND BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HIS PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0013 THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF TO KEEP
3997-180294-0014 AND ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABOURERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0015 THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVES SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SORROW TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAISING
3997-180294-0018 WHEN I REACHED MY HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAIETY
3997-180294-0019 THE WOMAN BECOMES THE MAN'S MASTER AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 SO WHY
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THAT WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT THAT VAUDEVILLE
3997-180294-0023 COME DURING THE THIRD ENTRAC
3997-180294-0024 THESE BOXES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTYING THE STAGE BOX
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AS MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0027 DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO THINK THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO MORROW SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 HE SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0030 WHERE AT HIM
3997-180294-0031 YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU THINK
3997-180294-0032 BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE HEARING HIM
3997-180294-0033 NONE THE LESS SHE WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0000 WE HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
3997-180297-0001 YOU' ARE IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID FLORENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE
3997-180297-0003 DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED TO ME ATTENTIVELY
3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME IN AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
3997-180297-0006 PERHAPS I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
3997-180297-0007 AND IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
3997-180297-0008 IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER THEN
3997-180297-0009 HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL AND
3997-180297-0010 I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU DID NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0011 WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH I GUESS
3997-180297-0012 I HAD LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHT MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRES OR INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING YOUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 I NO LONGER BELONGED TO OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017 WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEMS LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER CAN THEY GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME INTO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PERFECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0021 I THOUGHT I COULD EXCEPT THE LIFE WHICH HE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVED AND NEEDED WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP THE HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0024 MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU BUT DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
3997-180297-0025 MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO HER WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID
3997-180297-0026 HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT DOWN
3997-180297-0027 I TORE THAT LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT ME
3997-180297-0028 LOOK HERE PRUDENCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID JULIA
3997-180297-0029 HE WANTS YE TO FORGIVE HIM
3997-180297-0030 ONE HAS TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT IT THEN
3997-180297-0031 I EMBRACED MARGUERITE UNTIL SHE WAS ALMOST STIFLE
3997-182399-0000 WELL MISTER BUZZARD GRINNED
3997-182399-0001 THIS SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER PARTY

4198-12281-0005 LORD GOD DAM ME HE POTAM
4198-12281-0006 LET HIM BE CARRIED TO PRISON FOR TROUBLING THE DIVINE SERVANTS
4198-12281-0007 WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN THE ADVENT AT ALL THE WINTER
4198-12281-0008 HARK YOU MY MASTERS YOU THAT LOVE THE WINE COP'S BODY FOLLOW ME FOR SAINT ANTHONY BURNS ME AS FREELY AS A FAGGOT THEY GET LEAVE TO TASTE ONE DROP OF THE LIQUEUR THAT WILL NOT NOW COME AND FIGHT FOR RELIEF OF THE VINE

4198-12281-0010 TO SOME WITH THEIR SMART SOUS ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDRIFTS RAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOME PUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
4198-12281-0011 WHY THAT IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER ONE SAW
4198-12281-0012 O THE HOLY LADY NIITIS SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTUS O OUR LADY OF SUCCOURS SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP

4198-12281-0014 CAN YOU TELL WITH WHAT INSTRUMENTS THEY DID THIS
4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEAN TIME FRIAR JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT INTO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVORED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHER BY THE ADHERENCE OF WHICH HE IS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND THREATENING
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SHARD DURUS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
4198-61336-0003 TIGLATH PELISER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE EURENTIAN ARMY IN KUMAC
4198-61336-0004 A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF ITS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGULAR COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING CARDORUS WHO LEAPT FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOWS DEALT AGAINST URTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0007 THE SIFTI MATTI ILIU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHAWDORUS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TIGLATH PELEZER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WEST END WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0010 ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATID ILIU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE OFFICIALS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA
4198-61336-0012 ITS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THAT TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 JEHU ASH THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARDS HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHELIAM
4198-61336-0015 THIS USURPER HELD SWAY AT SUMERIA FOR ONLY A WEEK
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF NEHEIM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0017 TIGLATH PELIZER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTH EAST
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE DID NOT PUT TO THE SWARD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS HURATU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLATH PILLIER RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0021 MENUHEIM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PEGAHIAH
4198-61336-0022 JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT ITS INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0023 HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR ITS IDOLATRIES AND CRIED IT
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YE ME AND YE SHALL LIVE HAVE YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL
4198-61336-0025 THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES TO PERISH
4198-61336-0026 ISRAEL WAS ALSO DEALT WITH IT
4198-61336-0027 HE SLEPT THROUGH ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0028 THE PHILISTINES AND THE ARABS OF THE DESERT WERE ALSO SUBDUED
4198-61336-0029 HE INVADED BABYLONICIA
4198-61336-0030 UGENZER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITOL SEPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0000 AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT ON THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGNED IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ARTS WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME ERROR
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND I HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BENNEDELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR IF HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0005 I ASK NO HIGHER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE WORK
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD GONE TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FAVOUR TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0008 I ASKED HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM I HAD EVER TAKEN IN
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GEORGIO DE COTONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0010 GEORGO CAME FOR THEM HIS HEALTH
4294-14317-0011 I HOPE TO WORK ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THE SPEECH THE DUC ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LANDI WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGEELO
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF SCULPTOR'S CRAFT
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERO DID NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-14317-0016 AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGH AT ME AND CALLED ME THE NEW SCULPTOR
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENT
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE ON HEART I REACHED MY HOME
4294-32859-0000 WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGISHLY
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCIES I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDERLIN AND RHETCH'S PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AN I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE INSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT THE YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE TOWN WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEE BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGH'D HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE QUOTH
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHOULD BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN'S SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET OF JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGHED TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRIED HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND AND THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIES EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST REND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS OF THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE OGRE CRIED THE BOY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US FOR THE OGRE'S MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURRY HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 HIS SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO TELL THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY THE FREEDOM
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMPSE OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYHOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VESSEL TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A BREEZE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH A OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUARD YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME EXCLAIMED THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL INTO ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHT AWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR UNTIL FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIDER'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT ETHELRIED HEEDED NOT HIS TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE ISSOULT
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERMS AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALTOGETHER
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT AND DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT WHITE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUTH LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAIN HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRES TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE AFFECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN CURIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON ELBOWING HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIOUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAI
4294-9934-0013 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AND DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER GOLD HERE WAS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND THE BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 WHAT WILL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT MUCH WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU KNOW GERMAN O
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE COULD LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT OVER
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID FIFTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S
4294-9934-0022 HE BOUGHT THE HOUSE FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HELLO I' HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARTINIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING HIS TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK A THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 ON THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS MY MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER THE PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED TOWARDS KITTY
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME ANYTHING
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DAUGHTER
4350-10919-0005 AND YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE ANIMAL DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALUTRITIONS NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN ADVANCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
4350-10919-0009 YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED MAGICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKI BRIDGE DOWN YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON
4350-10919-0011 WE ASKED AH IT IS
4350-10919-0012 OH YES THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 THEN HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED IS THE USE OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH FOR LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0015 THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTABLELY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS AND REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN A MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
4350-10919-0018 AH AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 I TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THAT PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DEALS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND KITTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME UP SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FEARFUL
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME UNCLE BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YE'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 HER CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM WHERE I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON HER DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTION WHICH THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISIONS WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 THIS SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND MARY PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THIS EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-9170-0001 THIS IS ABSOLUTE INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUPS
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS POSSIBLY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006 THAT POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE AN ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE COMPANY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL THE MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT COULD HARDLY BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS MIGHT THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 AND SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RETAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEM STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THIS STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATIONS AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPERORS PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN ORDINARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS INTERFERE ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENTS
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING A GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIME SUBDUED BY CONQUESTS
4350-9170-0022 SO IT HAS ONLY BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFOUNDS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON IMPERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKE THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO A PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE CITY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR OBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT IT BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALL FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF OUR GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED TO THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAD BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY WAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THIS TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED OF THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGERS OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE'S SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS A MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONNECTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE INTENDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I KEEPING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I'M EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF A STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 PERHAPS FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 YOU NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE NOW
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY ORIGINAL EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THIS STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT NOW WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID AND FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED TO THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH AN ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS HAS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBOURS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREAT DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE ESTATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WOULD BE INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT BY A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES SHALL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAY YOU KNOW SOMEONE
4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR JOCK AND SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 NO WHO NEEDS THE JOB BAN THAT'S JAMIE HARRIS
4852-28311-0003 O QUAY HE SAID
4852-28311-0004 THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN UM STREET
4852-28311-0006 AH HE ADMITTED I DID
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS EXCLAIMED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 AND THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JACIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRISS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BITCHY AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL THIS TURNED TO HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING AT THE QUARTER
4852-28311-0013 HOW SHUCKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISS WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY THE CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK OF THE BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ONTO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEHIND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS STARTED TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED HERSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HALL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY HOUSES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTRE THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT A WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLES
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP WHILE HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SERVE
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARLINE WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF HOW MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOME ONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF NOT UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP IS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0003 HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS COVERED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0004 MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCES OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLE CHANGES OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZY ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0007 CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN NOW THEY WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0008 KIT SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
4852-28312-0009 YES DEAR HE SAID
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A FELLOW WHO NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0011 SHE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE
4852-28312-0012 JAKIE HARRIS'S NAME IS WHEN HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE BEAST WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL ABOUT THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOUR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM WITHOUT
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE A'S GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALNUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE ATAPHIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018 THE WORK SEEMED OVERLY STILL
4852-28312-0019 THEN IN ONE SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28312-0020 THE WILD BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHERE IS THE FREE ROAD
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKE TACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023 BUT WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EITHER DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMP LIT WINDOWS
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY THE INN
4852-28312-0027 THE COURTYARD WAS SPARELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON THE POST
4852-28312-0028 THE HOST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0029 A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLANGER COURTYARD
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF THE STABLE
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FROM THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28319-0000 THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS NECESSARY
4852-28319-0001 HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSLER HIS HOARD OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28319-0002 CROSS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLDFISH ON IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHALL ALLY DO FIRST
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU'VE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHOOSE BACK
4852-28319-0007 MISTER WORKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0008 THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER RILLER SAID START AT ONCE
4852-28319-0009 THE SENSATION WAS SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT OR A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT STILL BY
4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR FEET ONE THE RETURN
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE AND CURVED WITH POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0014 THAN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS
4852-28319-0015 IF HE WAS TO BE A CHRISTIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ASLEEP THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0017 BUT HOW DOES ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
4852-28319-0018 PETER GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY HE RESUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARDS AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE INCREASED A STORM
4852-28319-0021 STUFF CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY
4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND FORMED AT THE PROPER TIME
4852-28319-0023 MISTER HOOKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKE AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCION FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD COVERED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
4852-28319-0025 IT WAS AS IF THE BITTERNESS MELTED
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES THE WOOD AND FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HANDS HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET THE BOUQUET FALL
4852-28330-0000 THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS SOON
4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ALBERT JAMES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
4852-28330-0004 THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHITIN
4852-28330-0005 YOU'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON THERE
4852-28330-0006 CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CAPTAIN
4852-28330-0007 CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AS PENETRATING
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINNEH WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO NOT BE AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN THIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY IF I DO
4852-28330-0012 THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR FATHER OR FAMILY
4852-28330-0013 HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT KIT STANDING BEFORE HIM
4852-28330-0014 WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU THEN
4852-28330-0015 THIS SHIP THIS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY MISTER
4852-28330-0017 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN THIS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0018 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHOP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0019 CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANYONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET HAD UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0020 WHAT CANNOT BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS OUGHT TO ASK
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS THE CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND A CREW KNOW IT
4852-28330-0022 I SHALL SAY THAT YOURE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WOODER AND CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP IN SATISFACTIONILY ACCOUNTED FOR
4852-28330-0025 THEIR CONVERSATION HAD BEEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
533-1066-0000 WHEN CHURCHYARDS YANE
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER AND FOOD
533-1066-0002 I' AM SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
533-1066-0003 FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR BALL IN THE LODGE
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOMTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0005 MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UPSTAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TO DAY
533-1066-0006 I HAVE NONE I SAID CAREFULLY
533-1066-0007 I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING MORE UNUSUAL
533-1066-0008 THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE THIS PEACEFUL NIGHT
533-1066-0009 SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCCUR HE CRIED
533-1066-0010 PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT EVERYTHING
533-1066-0011 LIDIE WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
533-1066-0012 THEY WERE TALKING COFFICENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
533-1066-0013 THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT INTO THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0014 I ASKED NO QUESTIONS AND
533-1066-0015 ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STUART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIDE FENCE
533-1066-0016 I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I SUSPECT
533-1066-0017 THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHILE WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT
533-1066-0018 I CONFESSES THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A CHEERFUL SPOT
533-1066-0019 IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATHS IN SHARPLY
533-1066-0020 IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES AND
533-1066-0021 THE DOCTOR KEPT A COOL LOOKOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED
533-1066-0022 THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL DO NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY
533-1066-0023 A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING HIM UP
533-1066-0024 I HELD ONTO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN
533-131556-0000 BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MAY YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY GO
533-131556-0001 FOR NONE COULD INDUCE ME AS HE HAS DONE OH
533-131556-0002 THE WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM AND HATE HIM
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THIS GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
533-131556-0004 I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECALL THEM SO MINUTELY
533-131556-0005 THEY HAD BETAKING THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK
533-131556-0006 I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE IMPORTANCE OF IT
533-131556-0007 UPON PERUSING THIS SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP AND
533-131556-0008 YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND SHE'D FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT

533-131556-0012 I ENJOY A MOONLIGHT RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THE DRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RESORTS
533-131556-0013 SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY BUT REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER CHEEKS AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
533-131556-0014 I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
533-131556-0015 YES YES'
533-131556-0016 BUT SUPPOSE I DO
533-131556-0017 SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SPEAK
533-131556-0018 I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHICH IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
533-131556-0019 IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR ADDEPTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
533-131556-0020 I SHALL NOT TELL HIM IT
533-131556-0021 GIVE ME NO THINKS IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I REFRAIN
533-131556-0022 AND MILICENT WILL YOU TELL ME

533-131562-0002 THE KEY OF MY VESCH IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
533-131562-0003 NOW THEN SNEERED HE WE MUST HAVE THIS CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY
533-131562-0004 IN PUTTING THE KEYS INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY
533-131562-0005 BUT AND ALL REPLIED THE MASTER AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
533-131562-0006 MISTER HUNTINGDON THEN WENT OUT STAIRS
533-131562-0007 MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE'S VERY DEVILS FOR SPITE
533-131562-0008 I DIDN'T SAY I'D BROKEN IT DID I SAID HE

533-131562-0010 AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREEBS MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO IT ON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN

533-131562-0013 NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS BUT IT'S BEST TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
533-131562-0014 HERE BENSON ENTERED THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENTLY TRIUMPHING IN MY DISCOVERY

533-131564-0018 THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIM'S B AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENUOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON THE OTHER MEN'S SHOULDERS

533-131564-0027 AFTER THAT THEY MUST REPAIR TO THEIR COUNTRY HOME
5442-32873-0000 CAPTAIN LAKE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE A LONDON DANDIE DOWN
5442-32873-0001 THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND WILD LURE IN HIS YELLOW EYES RACHAEL SAT DOWN
5442-32873-0002 A SLAVE ONLY SPEAK A SLAVE
5442-32873-0003 ALL FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL IS IT A DREAM
5442-32873-0004 ALL FRIGHTFUL TERRIBLE
5442-32873-0005 STANLEY STANLEY IT WOULD BE MERCY TO KILL ME SHE BROKE BACK AGAIN
5442-32873-0006 BRIGHT AND GNATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH A BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF A SAGE HER PILLOWS SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
5442-32873-0007 WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TORLIT BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
5442-32873-0008 THERE WAS NOTHING SO BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE PROCESS
5442-32873-0009 THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESSES AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM
5442-32873-0010 AND SHE THREW BACK HER VEILS AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS
5442-32873-0011 RACHAEL LEAK RACHAEL LAKE WHAT ARE YOU NOW
5442-32873-0012 I'LL STAY HERE THAT IS INTO THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-32873-0013 HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT A LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGERT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0014 LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKIN'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WILDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOLL CART FOR MIKE BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOUGH CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
5442-32873-0015 BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LION WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARD THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGDEN
5442-32873-0016 HERE WAS THE FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
5442-32873-0017 LOSE NO TIME AND THEN I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A CRUMB
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STOLE HOME HIS GREASY WIDE AWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOLL CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD MORNING TAMAR
5442-41168-0000 THE OLD SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT OUT TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COURSE SERGY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THIS SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCES HAD TO CALL FOR OTTO A BALLOT
5442-41168-0004 HE SHED OUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHALS HE IS NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 VOTES PLEASE BAIN
5442-41168-0007 THEY EXPRESSED THE ALMOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOVE FLEROFF SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD HIS RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THAT REFRESHMENT BAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAVE WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHEWED A SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JURED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN PAUSED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0014 SOGAY IVANOVITCH FROWNED
5442-41168-0015 THAT IS A MATTER OF EACH MAN'S OWN DECISION HE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACK GROUND
5442-41168-0017 A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETY THREE AGAINST
5442-41168-0018 SANG WITH THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
5442-41168-0019 THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO KNOTTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX
5442-41168-0020 BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERERS
5442-41168-0021 IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTIONS THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO OWEN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE ME
5442-41168-0024 AND AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
5442-41168-0025 THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THIS ELECTION
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNETCHOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT LIEROV TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMEN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT BUT HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID AROUND ABOUT HIM
5442-41169-0002 HE'S NOT A BLACKGUARD
5442-41169-0003 I HAVE TOLD HIM SO THAT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
5442-41169-0004 THEIR PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY AND FINE CHAMPAGNE
5442-41169-0006 LAST YEAR HAD OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S

5442-41169-0008 WHY WHAT ARE THERE TO UNDERSTAND
5442-41169-0009 THERE IS NO MEANING IN IT AFTER ALL
5442-41169-0010 THEN TOO ONE MIGHT KEEP UP CONNECTIONS
5442-41169-0011 IT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF A SOUL
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE'S ONE'S OWN INTEREST'S
5442-41169-0013 THEY'RE PROPRIETORS OF A SOD BUT WE ARE THE LANDOWNERS
5442-41169-0014 THAT IT MAY BE BUT LITTLE IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE A TREE THAT HAS STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND HOW IS YOUR FRIEND DOING
5442-41169-0017 IF ONE'S WORK IS THROWN IN FOR NOTHING
5442-41169-0018 OH WELL ONE HAS IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0019 AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY LOVE I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT BACK AND YET ONE DOES IT
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDENS NO SAID HE STEPAN VASLIEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'D SHUT DOWN THAT LIME TREE
5442-41169-0023 HERE YOUVE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BACH
5442-41169-0024 YOU'RE RIGHT I HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER

5442-41169-0026 A LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MUSTACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR POTS FOR TUMBLE
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT HAD JUST STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT TWO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMEHOW ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT HER RETURN TOO AT A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HERMANN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANE
5484-24317-0002 SHE SHOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS EXISTENCE
5484-24317-0004 THIS BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 AND HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUED DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTLE HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED THIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WILL NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT A LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMANN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATISTS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSANO
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT EVEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELT CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMAN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 CRETES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICHO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENUL'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN A ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSIMACHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED AMON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES THE TIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISED ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMERTAS THE LIEGE CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLIS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THAT LUCK PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSTENAU IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG I KEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MAY HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023 WHICH IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMANN
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENALT HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EASILY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HERMAND LOOKED TO THE PAIR IN SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENIUS ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRATEZ HERMANN'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMEANOR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL WOMEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONVERSATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMAND'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WERE STILL A GENUINE CREATIVE ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNATHS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND YET YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER ASSISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMANN PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LEFT TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAF TO HIS ART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN END AS A BOOM FROM THE IMMORTAL
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS DEEP AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT OBTAIN HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION AND HERMANN WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AND ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTES AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST IN THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24318-0010 YET IT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT PRECEDED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT APPROACHED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS MANNER SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHOM SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERRIMAND IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOW THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHAT TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPCA SILENCED HER WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THAT PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT FOR GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOR EVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALASTRA THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LIVED YOU ALWAYS
5484-24318-0021 DAPHNE EXCLAIMED INDIGNANTLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMANN WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MYSELF I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORK OF MYRTIUS
5484-24318-0024 WHICH A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU
5484-24318-0025 AND I FOOL BLINDED ALSO IN MINE COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL AND PALLIATE
5484-24318-0027 SORYCAIUS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE PARTY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY EMINETES THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORDS
5484-24318-0031 IN THE WAY HIS HEART THROPPED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND MOTHER WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE HIS TRUTH ITS JUST DUE
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERMANON
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATULUS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HERMONN
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMERE HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOR TO MYRTELUS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FORESTAL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMBS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THESE GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVESTS
5764-299665-0001 WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND YOURSELF
5764-299665-0002 WHETHER ANY PRAYERS WAS EVER ANSWERED
5764-299665-0003 WHY DID HE CREATE THEIR INTELLECTUAL INFERIOR
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND CARELESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0005 ARE THEY FAILURES UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0006 IS THEY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0007 IS SHE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH A LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOWED FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0008 IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE DUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0009 DID THIS GOD A LORD THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0010 DID HE ILLOWED TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0011 CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL SAVE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DIVORRE HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE LEADS ON LIFE
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NERVES THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
5764-299665-0015 FEAR BUILDS THE ALTAR AND OFFER THE SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0016 FAIR ERECTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0017 LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FRIGHTFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0018 CAN WE SAY THAT HE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE MEN
5764-299665-0019 CAN WE SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDUREETH FOREVER
5764-299665-0020 CAN WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0021 WAS THIS GOODNESS WAS THERE WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0022 OUGHT THE SUPERIOR RACE TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THEIR INFERIOR
5764-299665-0023 MOST MOST PEOPLE CLING TO THE SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0024 IF THEY MAKE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE ANOTHER
5764-299665-0025 WHAT IS THIS PARTY
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES DUE EXPERIENCE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE KEPT TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0028 HE HATH TRIED THAT ROAD AND KNOWS THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPED HER WITH HIS DIMPLED HAND
5764-299665-0030 THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAD TAUGHT HER CHILD A LESSON
5764-299665-0031 IT AS A RESULT
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS SUPPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0033 WE LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIVES
5764-299665-0034 THEY ARE PRAISED ADMIRED BUT RESPECTED
5764-299665-0035 THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MODERN
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MENDERS
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HE HAD SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LOVE
5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE ADVANCE ON THE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0039 THE IMAGINATION IT CULTIVATED
5764-299665-0040 A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN A PLACE OF ANOTHER
5764-299665-0041 THE SENSE OF THE DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
5764-299665-0042 NO MAN JUDGES HIMSELF
5764-299665-0043 IN ALL THIS THERE IS ANYTHING SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0044 MAN HAS DESERVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HES CHRISTIANITY DUN GOUND
5764-299665-0046 WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL WERE MEN MAKE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY OVER AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE CREATURES HAVE BEEN WORTH WITHOUT RELIGION
5764-299665-0049 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGIOUS THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0050 HOW DID CHRISTIANITY DO FOR THEM
5764-299665-0051 THEY HATED THE PLEASURE
5764-299665-0052 THEY MUFFLED ALL THE BELLOWS OF GLADNESS
5764-299665-0053 THE TRADITION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED CURSE
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT PROUD AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE AND HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0056 BUT THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH NOT AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT
5764-299665-0058 HAS THE BIBLES MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES AND HAS FAILED
5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND OF THOUGHT
5764-299665-0061 RELIGION HAS NEVER MADE WOMEN FREE
5764-299665-0062 IT HAS NEVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS OR HONEST
5764-299665-0063 OUR CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARER HONEST THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0064 CAN WE CURE DISEASES BY SUPPLICATIONS
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE REPEAT VIRTUE OR HONOR AS ALMS
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT HE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT HIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE CORN THE STONE
5764-299665-0068 THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A BASMONT
5764-299665-0069 IF WE BUILD WE MUST BEGIN ON THE BOTTOM
5764-299665-0070 I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE TWO CORNERSTONES
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST PLAN IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNERSTONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM TIME TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN NOR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE OR ANY DESIGN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0075 I MAY SAY WHAT I THINK
5764-299665-0076 EVERY GREAT EVENT HAS PARENTS
5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED WILL NOT
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHAINED RIIS AND THE CAMP BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINKS
5764-299665-0079 WE NOW KNOW WHAT OUR FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0080 WE ALL KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE PASSAGE THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELLED
5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE FOOT OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE EARTH
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE THE REFORMERS FELT
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND ON THE LORD IN LUCK AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE TO BEQUEATH THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0087 FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE BY
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PRESERVED WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
5764-299665-0089 MUST THE WORLD FOR EVER REMAINED A VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CAN NOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE A BURDEN AND CURSES
5764-299665-0091 PASSION IT IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEAF
5764-299665-0092 LAW CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM THE CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
5764-299665-0093 THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY COURT OR EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0094 THUS IS THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0095 THUS FREES WOMEN
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME WILL NOT BE CHILDLESS
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FAULTS AND PROJECTS OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE
6070-63485-0000 THERE DONE FAR SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOW KEY TO THE CHOWETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE
6070-63485-0001 THE TWO DOCTORS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSES
6070-63485-0002 BY MEANS OF THIS STRATAGEM THEY FOLLOWED SO CLOSELY THAT ALTHOUGH WITHIN A FEW STEPS OF SARAH AND TOM THEY DID NOT HEAR THEN
6070-63485-0003 SARAH AND HER BROTHER HAVING AGAIN PASSED BY THE TUPPY FRANC ARRIVED CLOSE TO THE DILAPIDATED HOUSE WHICH WAS PARTLY IN RUINS AND ITS OPEN CELLARS FORMED A KIND OF GULF OVER WHICH THE STREET RAN IN THAT DIRECTION
6070-63485-0004 IN AN INSTANT THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH A LEAP RESEMBLING IN STRENGTH AND AGILITY THE SPRINGS OF A TIGER SEIZED SATAN WITH ONE HAND BY THE THROAT AND EXCLAIMED YOUR MONEY OR I WILL FLING YOU INTO THIS HOLE
6070-63485-0005 NO SAID THE OLD BRUTE GRUMBLINGLY NO NOT ONE RING WHAT OF SHAME
6070-63485-0006 TOM SEYTON DID NOT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND DURING THIS SCENE RAPIDLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AS HAD OCCURRED
6070-63485-0007 AW AH TO LAY A TRAP TO CATCH US REPLIED THE THIEF
6070-63485-0008 THEN ADDRESSING THOMAS SEYTERN YOU KNOW THE PLAIN OF SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0009 DID YOU SEE IN THE CABARET WE HAVE JUST LEFT FOR I KNOW YOU AGAIN THAT MAN WHOM THE CHARCOAL MAN CAME TO SEEK
6070-63485-0010 CRIED A SCHOOLMASTER A THOUSAND FRANCS AND I'LL KILL HIM
6070-63485-0011 WRETCH I DO NOT SEE HIS WIFE REPLIED SARAH TO THE SCHOOLMASTER
6070-63485-0012 LET'S GO AND MAKE HIM
6070-63485-0013 ALL ABOUT IT WILL BE FOR LOOKING AFTER
6070-63485-0014 WELL MY WIFE SHALL BE THERE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER YOU WILL TELL HER WHAT YOU WANTS I SHALL SEE
6070-63485-0015 IN THE PLAIN OF SAINT VENIS
6070-63485-0016 BETWEEN SAINT OIN AND THE ROAD OF LA RIVITE AT THE END OF THE ROAD AGREED
6070-63485-0017 WE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS OF THE SELF STYLED FAN PAINTER
6070-63485-0018 THE FIACRE STARTED
6070-86744-0000 FRANZ WHO SEEMED ATTRACTED BY SOME INVISIBLE INFLUENCE TOWARDS THE COUNT IN WHICH TERROR IS STRANGELY MINGLED FELT AN EXTREME RELUCTANCE TO PERMIT HIS FRIEND TO BE EXPOSED ALONE TO THE SINGULAR FASCINATION THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE SEEMED TO EXERCISE OVER HIM AND THEREFORE MADE NO OBJECTION TO ALBERT'S REQUEST BUT AT ONCE ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DESIRED SPOT AND AFTER A SHORT DELAY THE COUNT JOINED THEM IN THE SALON
6070-86744-0001 MY VERY GOOD FRIEND AN EXCELLENT NEIGHBOUR SAID THE COUNT WITH A SMILE YOU REALLY EXAGGERATE MY TRIFLING EXERTIONS
6070-86744-0002 MY FATHER THE COMTE DE MORCERF ALTHOUGH OF SPANISH ORIGIN POSSESSES CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE BOTH AT THE COURT OF FRANCE AND MADRID AND I UNHESITATINGLY PLACE THE BEST SERVICES FOR MYSELF AND ALL TO WHOM MY LIFE IS DEAR AT YOUR DISPOSAL
6070-86744-0003 THEY CAN SCARCELY CREDIT IT
6070-86744-0004 THEN IT IS SETTLED SAID THE COUNCIL AND I GIVE YOU MY SOLEMN ASSURANCE THAT I ONLY WAITED AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THE PRESENT TO REALIZE PLANS THAT I HAVE LONG MEDITATED
6070-86744-0005 SHALL WE MAKE A POSITIVE APPOINTMENT FOR A PARTICULAR DAY AND HOUR INQUIRED THE COUNT ONLY LET ME WARN YOU THAT I AM PROVERBIAL FOR MY PUNCTILIOUS EXACTITUDE IN KEEPING MY ENGAGEMENTS DAY FOR DAY HOUR FOR HOUR SAYS ALBERT THAT WILL SUIT ME TO A DOT
6070-86744-0006 SO BE IT THEN REPLIED THE COUNT AND EXTENDING HIS HAND TOWARDS THE CALENDAR SUSPENDED ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE HE SAID TO DAY IS THE TWENTY FIRST OF FEBRUARY AND DRAWING OUT HIS WATCH ADDED IT IS EXACTLY HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK NOW PROMISE ME TO REMEMBER THIS AND EXPECT ME THE TWENTY FIRST OF MAY AT THE SAME HOUR IN THE FORENOON
6070-86744-0007 I RESIDE IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE BUT OCCUPY A PAVILION AT THE FARTHEST SIDE OF THE COURT YARD AND TILE IS SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN BUILDING
6070-86744-0008 NOW THEN SAID THE CAPTAIN RETURNING HIS TABLETS TO HIS POCKET MAKE YOURSELF PERFECTLY EASY THE HAND OF YOUR TIMEPIECE WILL NOT BE MORE ACCURATE IN MARKING THE TIME THAN MYSELF
6070-86744-0009 THAT DEPENDS WHEN DO YO LEAVE
6070-86744-0010 FOR FRANCES NO FOR VENICE I SHALL REMAIN IN ITALY FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO
6070-86744-0011 THEN WE MUST NOT MEET IN PARIS
6070-86744-0012 I FEAR I SHALL NOT HAVE THAT HORROR
6070-86744-0013 WELL SINCE WE MUST PART SAID THE COUNT HOLDING OUT A HAND TO EACH OF THE YOUNG WOMEN ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU BOTH A SAFE AND PLEASANT JOURNEY
6070-86744-0014 WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED ALBERT OF PARIS WHEN THEY HAD RETURNED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS YOU SEEM MORE THAN COMMONLY THOUGHTFUL
6070-86744-0015 I WILL CONFESS TO YOU EDWARD REPLIED FRANZ THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0016 DID YOU EVER MEET IT PREVIOUSLY TO COMING HITHER
6070-86744-0017 UPON MY HONOUR THEN TO ME
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY ON THE VARIOUS MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAM AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YACHT SEEN IN THE DISTANT HORIZON DRIVING UNDER FULL SAIL TOWARDS PORTO VECCHIO
6070-86744-0019 THEN HE DETAILS THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86744-0020 BUT SAID FRANTZ THE CORSICAN BANDITS WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSEL
6070-86744-0021 WHY ALTHOUGH THE THING SEEMS TO ME SIMPLE ENOUGH
6070-86744-0022 TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DOES HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT WERE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELLOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINGERED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY
6070-86744-0023 CERTAINLY THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IN YOUR LIFE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANSWERED
6070-86744-0024 MY DEAR FRANTZ REPLIED ARTHUR WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO DELIVER HIM
6070-86744-0025 WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT IS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY IS HE THE NATIVE
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESS HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SENOR VAMPA WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF PEACE AND UNCONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN THE EFFECT OF ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ALBERT'S SIDE
6070-86744-0028 WELL SAID PORTHOS WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT FOR YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND MY POWERS OF REFUTATION
6070-86744-0029 AND NOW MY DEAR VALENTINE LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
6070-86745-0000 THEN SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND COURT OF THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0002 AT A QUARTER TO TEN A VALET ENTERED HE PROPOSED WITH A LITTLE GROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASSEUR ALSO
6070-86745-0003 WAIT THEN DURING THE DAY AND TELL ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISHED
6070-86745-0004 VERY LITTLE AT HALF PAST TEN
6070-86745-0005 IS THE HOUSE UP YET
6070-86745-0006 THE VALET LEFT THIS ROOM
6070-86745-0007 GOOD MORNING LUCIEN GOOD MORNING SAID ALBERT YOUR PUNCTUALITY NEARLY ALARMS ME
6070-86745-0008 YOU' WHOM I EXPECTED LAST YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIXED WAS HALF PAST
6070-86745-0009 NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW DO NOT CONTRADICT OUR PLANS
6070-86745-0010 PERHAPS HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGES IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTH
6070-86745-0011 IT IS FOR THAT REASON YOU SEE ME SO NEARLY
6070-86745-0012 I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO HAVE A RID FOR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 PESTS I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FOR GOVERNMENT YOU WOULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE
6070-86745-0014 BESIDES THAT DOES NOT CONCERN THE WHOLE BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
6070-86745-0015 ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE FLOWERS
6070-86745-0016 IN THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD IN WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH LAND YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE
6070-86745-0018 COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIR
6070-86745-0019 WITH YOUR TALENTS YOU WOULD MAKE OUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN AND BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM THE TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
6128-63240-0001 THAT HATH AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
6128-63240-0002 IF SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORK DAY ASPECT
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED SPOT
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MELANCHOLY EYES
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE THERE WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS AND THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE WHOLLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD
6128-63240-0009 AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT GAYLY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPLEES AND ROARING RADICALS
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT THOUGH MURDER
6128-63240-0012 HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUNIER WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6128-63240-0013 SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ABSOLUTELY THE LATTER
6128-63240-0014 ARE YOU BEEN IN EUROPE
6128-63240-0015 NO I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES IT SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH THAT
6128-63240-0017 THAT LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LENA
6128-63240-0018 ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LIVE AS IF YOU WERE
6128-63240-0019 THEN MISSUS LENA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0020 YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR
6128-63240-0021 BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BUSTED AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0022 THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY HARMS
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISS RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LINEY'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY LAID IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A THEATER PARTY THAT IS WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LUNEY'S SUPERIORITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSLOW THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BOEOTIAN AS IN THAT MOMENT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNEL'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002 RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE ADDITION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER WHICH WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE GREAT ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THE SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER AT HIS HEART
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF WE HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT HE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0009 OLIVE HAD A VIEW OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFEST AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM INTO BOSTON
6128-63241-0012 HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS OFTEN DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BAZZA RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF HAVING THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THAT VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE BOYS ON BEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT THE BALLOT
6128-63244-0002 PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHER
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF VERY OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
6128-63244-0004 OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKING ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0005 ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVED THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FAVENDER WHO LIVED AT RUXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINGER SUPPOSED BUT THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0007 SHE WISHED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THAT PEOPLE
6128-63244-0008 THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT THEY HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0009 CHARLIE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A LIGHT OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH THE MOST
6128-63244-0010 OLIVE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MISSUS BERINGER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
6128-63244-0011 IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE HIS SHRINKING
6128-63244-0012 EVERY MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
6128-63244-0013 RAISE THE STANDARD AMONG MEN AND BRING ME YOUR THOUSAND NAMES
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BRICK CURRANTS MISSUS FARVENDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0015 SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR HER REMISSION OF RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0016 I WON'T TO BE NEAR THEM TO HELP THEM
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THEIR SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAS CHOSEN FOR HER
6128-63244-0018 IS THE UNHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
6128-63244-0019 THEY ARE HER SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THEIR DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT THE JUST REVOLUTION IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTE BLOOD STAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0021 THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMEN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY MUSCLE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE MIST OF EMOTIONS WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY AS SUCCESS
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BIRD'S EYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEM ALREADY THE MARTYR
6128-63244-0024 OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG AND HEWARDED WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OR AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY HE HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
6432-63722-0000 BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YOU FIGURE ON DOIN SOME DETECTIN AND GIVE UP FISHING
6432-63722-0001 AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING A NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
6432-63722-0002 I'M GOING ON FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING AND MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
6432-63722-0003 GET READY SHAG YASKER COLONEL
6432-63722-0004 AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HAD HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT OUT TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
6432-63722-0005 PINKUS AND DONOVAN HAVEN'T THEY CARROLL YER
6432-63722-0006 CAROL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM THE CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
6432-63722-0007 ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON MY CASE COLONEL
6432-63722-0008 BUT WE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT COLONEL THAN THAT CAT
6432-63722-0009 PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED COLONEL ASHMAN
6432-63722-0010 WE'VE GOT OUR MEN AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT
6432-63722-0011 YOU'RE ON THE DARCY CASE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YET
6432-63722-0012 I AM WORKING IN THE INTEREST OF A YOUNG MAN
6432-63722-0013 THAT'S JUST ONE OF THEM COINCIDENCES LIKE
6432-63722-0014 BUSTED HIS FOOT IN WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE OF A PAIR
6432-63722-0015 GAD EXPLAINED THE EARL
6432-63722-0016 THE VERY PATH I WAS GOING TO BUY
6432-63722-0017 LOOK HERE COL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
6432-63722-0018 AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS KINDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SING A PHUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63722-0020 NOW I' AM AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
6432-63722-0021 PHUTE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED GIR ALI
6432-63722-0022 ANYHOW HE AND FUZ DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL IT SEEMS
6432-63722-0023 NEIGHBOURS OFTEN HEARD HER SCRAPPING A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
6432-63722-0024 TOWARD DARK A MAN WENT IN TO BUY A CAMP
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND THIS HEAVY CANDLESTICK IN IT
6432-63722-0026 SURE HELD SO TIGHT HE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
6432-63722-0027 MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH BUT THE DAGOES TALKED IN THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBOURS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0028 AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU THAT YES IT'S HERE
6432-63722-0029 THAT'S THE WATCH ANNOUNCED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE REACHING IN FOR IT LOOKING YET SEE

6432-63722-0031 AND DONALN'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SCEPTICAL
6432-63722-0032 PERHAPS IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUGH EDGES ON IT
6432-63722-0033 AND I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GEMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
6432-63722-0034 IF YOU WON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THIS A BIT
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE CARDINAL
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE WELL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT PUSH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL
6432-63722-0038 AND DONOVAN TAKE HIS FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
6432-63722-0039 ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE AS
6432-63722-0040 DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF ON IT WHATEVER YOU DO WHY NOT

6432-63722-0047 RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A HUNDRED FIFTY PROPOSITION
6432-63722-0048 AT LEAST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH THE SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0049 WITH YOU I DON'T WANT IT EITHER
6432-63722-0050 BUT I WANT TO SEE JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW

6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HAWK
6432-63723-0001 AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMPED FISH INTO THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
6432-63723-0002 THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENETH
6432-63723-0003 NO IT WASN'T THINKING OF THAT
6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE NOTICED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
6432-63723-0005 WELL I DON'T KNOW IT YOU CAN
6432-63723-0006 IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HER
6432-63723-0007 IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MUST BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL IT'S WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0009 THE COLONEL DO NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
6432-63723-0010 AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS MADE UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED
6432-63723-0011 HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD LONG BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012 SHE THOUGHT HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0013 BECAUSE THE LARCH MADE NO DEFENCE
6432-63723-0014 LERCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO OUR COUNCIL FEE
6432-63723-0016 NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET SOMETHING OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0017 AND IT TAKES ALL SORT OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP
6432-63723-0018 STILL WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH HE WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELLER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0020 IT HATH A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALLROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN THE DINING ROOM OR CAFE
6432-63723-0022 LARCHER HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
6432-63723-0023 IN A SMALLER LIFE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
6432-63723-0024 AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS AND HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RACHFORD HAD MARRIED
6432-63723-0025 TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER AND WHISPERED MONEY
6432-63723-0026 AND IN HER WAY IT WAS TRUE
6432-63723-0027 WE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
6432-63723-0028 AFTER THIS MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
6432-63723-0029 THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE ROOT
6432-63723-0030 BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WORE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
6432-63723-0031 IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO STOOD IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL
6432-63723-0032 MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE COULD HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING TO BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
6432-63723-0033 DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME ON ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0034 I WAS GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME
6432-63723-0035 IT'S HARD FOR MISS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BURIED UP LIKE A MAJOR
6432-63723-0036 SO KING GOT BAIL WHO PUT IT
6432-63723-0037 IT WAS HIGH THE LARCH
6432-63723-0038 THEN TOOK HARRY AWAY A WHILE AGO
6432-63723-0039 BUT HIS ARE VERY UNCERTAIN SHOES TO BE IN JUST THE SAME
6432-63723-0040 ONLY THAT I DARCY SHE HESITATED AND GREW RED
6432-63723-0041 GOOD EVENING COLONEL HE CALLED GENIALLY WILL YOU JOIN ME IN A WELSH POET
6432-63723-0042 THANK YOU SO
6432-63723-0043 I'M AFRAID MY DIGESTION ISN'T QUITE UP TO THAT AS I'VE HAD TO CUT OUT YOUR FISHING OF LATE
6432-63723-0044 AND NOW AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE STORE ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER
6432-63723-0045 THE STOPS CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU ANY THEORY

6432-63723-0049 I SAID WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED THE OTHER WE' HAVE MISSED YOU
6432-63723-0050 I SAID I WAS GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY THROUGH WITH AN EFFORT
6432-63723-0051 WHY POLONUS SOME ONE ASKED
6432-63723-0052 BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS SO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
6432-63723-0053 THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM A WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
6432-63723-0054 IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISTER DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
6432-63723-0055 I WENT OVER EM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
6432-63723-0056 WHAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELER
6432-63723-0057 OH HARRY KING HAS IT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY
6938-70848-0000 AND EVEN THE SUN CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY AT NOON
6938-70848-0001 THE COLDS AND THE RHEUMATISM OF THE RAINY MONTHS VANISHED
6938-70848-0002 ASKED A WORKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DO IT WHEN THE YUNKERS
6938-70848-0003 WELL DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US ONE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARM IN THE SLING
6938-70848-0004 HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM WITH THE DEVILS
6938-70848-0005 WHO ARE YOU TO DESTROY THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT WHO'S LENIN A GERMAN
6938-70848-0006 WHO ARE YOU A COUNTERREVOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THE BELOVED ADAM
6938-70848-0007 YOU CALL YOURSELVES THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU ARE NOT THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA
6938-70848-0008 THE PISTANS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS
6938-70848-0009 WE KNOW WHAT THE SPANIARDS WILL SAY AREN'T THEY WORKING MEN LIKE OURSELVES
6938-70848-0010 THIS MAN ESPECIALLY WELCOMED THE CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PRESIDENTS
6938-70848-0011 THIS LAST THE YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
6938-70848-0012 WHEREUPON THE ALL EXECUTED COMMITTEE LEFT THE HALL
6938-70848-0013 THEN WITH HIM THEY SHRIEKED
6938-70848-0014 FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN FROM THE BOLSHEVIKI
6938-70848-0015 UPON MY RETURN I VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THAT AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANY ONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
6938-70848-0016 FINALLY THE QUESTION OF THE STRATUS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
6938-70848-0017 BY DECLINING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAS BEEN PLANNED TO BLOCK THE REELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LOUD SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRRIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
6938-70848-0020 THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO BREAK OF THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
6938-70848-0021 FOLLOWED HIM OLENIN LISTENED TO THEM WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
6938-70848-0022 THE FIRST AGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISTS AND THE LANDOWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CLUMSY
6938-70848-0023 THE DUMESS AND ZAMS STOOFS WERE DROPPED
6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT OF THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED
6938-70848-0025 HE SPOKE TO OF THE RUM CONVENTION
6938-70848-0026 THE VILLAGES WILL SEE US IN THE END
6938-70848-0027 BUT THIS PRESENT MOMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IT IS INVINCIBLE
6938-70848-0028 THE VIEW OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN THE HALL
6938-70848-0029 A NEW HUMANITY SHALL BE BORN OF THIS WAR
6938-70848-0030 I GREET YOU WITH THE CHRISTENING OF AN NEW RUSSIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM
7018-75788-0000 THEN I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED DOWN HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
7018-75788-0001 BEYOND A SHIP WAS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THE DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
7018-75788-0002 HEARING THIS I WAS SORE TROUBLE REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED FROM THE APE KIND
7018-75788-0003 UPON THIS HE BROUGHT ME A COTTON BAG AND GIVING IT TO ME SAID TAKE THIS BAG AND FILLED IT WITH PEBBLES FROM THE BEACH AND GO FORTH WITH A COMPANY OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO WHOM I WILL GIVE A CHARGE RESPECTING THEE
7018-75788-0004 DO AS THEY DO AND BELIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FURTHER THY RETURN VOYAGE TO MY NATIVE LAND
7018-75788-0005 THEN HE CARRIED ME TO THE BEACH WHERE I FILLED MY BAG WITH PEBBLES GREAT AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLK ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH BEARING A BAG LIKE MINE FILLED WITH PEBBLES
7018-75788-0006 TO THESE HE COMMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO THEIR CARE AND SAYING THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY EAT HIS DAILY BREAD AND YOU WILL EARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
7018-75788-0007 NOW SLEEPING UNDER THESE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONGST THE BRANCHES WHEREUPON MY COMPANIONS BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE FOLK
7018-75788-0008 THEY WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF THE DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
7018-75788-0009 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIFTH NIGHT
7018-75788-0010 AND CEASED NOT SAILING TILL WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT BUSSAH
7018-75788-0011 THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTERS AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FORGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STORE HOUSES
7018-75788-0012 AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GREAT PROFIT OR GAIN I HAD MADE
7018-75788-0013 NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING MUHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL CREATURES BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND WISHED HIM A GOOD DAY
7018-75788-0014 HERE I FOUND A GREAT SHIP READY FOR SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD WITH THEM GOODS OF PEACE SO I EMBARKED MY BALES THEREIN
7018-75788-0015 HAPPILY AMONGST YOU IS ONE RIGHTEOUS WHOSE PRAYERS THE LAW WILL ACCEPT
7018-75788-0016 PRESENTLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE MOUNTAIN AND BROKE OUT AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD OF HER WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75788-0017 BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT OUT AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS COLOUR AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE TRAVELERS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
7018-75788-0018 EACH THAT DIED WE WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTH AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE TILL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT A LITTLE PROVISION LEFT I WHO WAS WONT TO HAVE SO MUCH
7018-75788-0019 FOR THERE IS MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT
7018-75789-0000 WHEN IT WAS THE NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST NIGHT
7018-75789-0001 THEN SIGNED FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND CORMORINE ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIP'S STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOESWOOD MAKING ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
7018-75789-0002 LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE ON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS IN NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
7018-75789-0003 I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED IN THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOVE IN MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0005 WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF THE NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
7018-75789-0006 BUT I WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE ROOM
7018-75789-0007 WHEN THEY SAW I UNDERSTOOD THEM NOT AND MADE THEM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER
7018-75789-0008 OH MY BROTHER ANSWERED HE WE ARE HUSBANDMEN AND TILLERS OF THE SOIL WHO CAME OUT TO WATER OUR FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS AND FINDING THEE ASLEEP ON THIS RAFT LAID HOLD OF IT AND MADE IT FAST BY US THAT THOU SHOULDST AWAKE AT THY LEISURE

7018-75789-0010 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SECONDS
7018-75789-0011 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HAD TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING THAT HE MAY ACQUAINT HIM WITH ITS ADVENTURES
7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH HIS CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0013 SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH MY MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND
7018-75789-0014 QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US ON OUR HEAD AND EYES BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST US BY THY COMPANY

7018-75789-0017 HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY WHITHER
7018-75789-0018 FROM STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND UPON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUESTS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
7018-75789-0019 HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THIS AND AS TO THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST EYE WITNESSED
7018-75789-0020 PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND A LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRYMAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED
7018-75789-0021 SUCH THEN O MY BROTHERS IS A HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL ME IN MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TO MORROW INSHALLAH
7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF OUR SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THE NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAY IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEA
7018-75789-0026 KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE AND ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENTS AND MIRTH IN MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF VARIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGHDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 THEN THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLIMBED TO THE MASTHEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IT IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT WE WHOSO COME HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS A SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID AND BOTH BE PEACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE AS WHICH WE HAD SEEN NOUGHT MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKEN UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO PLATTERBAETH'S GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGH THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HOUSE THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LORD MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BYE ELECTIONS WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND BONING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FOR CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATH LIKE HUSH
7105-2330-0007 THE FOREMAN DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE AND
7105-2330-0008 THE JURY FOUND A PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISH TO ADD A WRITER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A VILECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS ON HAND
7105-2330-0010 AN MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE POLE A JUNIOR CONSUL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
7105-2330-0011 FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK O
7105-2330-0012 OUR MAJORITY LASTIM WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN
7105-2330-0013 SEVEN SEVENTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTER BAH IS OUT BEFORE THE POLE OPENS
7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RED RUPPA'S INN TO NIGHT
7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRILLON THE REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
7105-2330-0017 HE EXCLAIMED WON'T GO IT
7105-2330-0018 HE SAYS HE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS HAND TO PLAY HIM OUT AND HE'S NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW
7105-2330-0019 SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A ELISED PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ESTIMATES
7105-2330-0020 ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BIT
7105-2330-0021 PAUL OPENS IN FIVE MINUTES AND
7105-2330-0022 IS PLADDERBOFF OUT YET
7105-2330-0023 IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHY THEN
7105-2330-0024 THE CHIEF ORGANIZER RUSHED OFF
7105-2330-0025 THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE EMPLOYED AT ONCE
7105-2330-0026 CAN'T YOU GET A STRIKE PERMIT ASKED THE ORGANIZERS
7105-2330-0027 I'LL TRY SAID THE HOME SECRETARY WHO WENT TO THE TELEPHONE
7105-2330-0028 EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND I'LL VOTE THE OTHER WAY
7105-2330-0029 A TELEGRAM HAD BROUGHT IN
7105-2330-0030 IT WAS FROM THAT CENTRAL COMETY ROOMS AT NEMESIS
7105-2330-0031 WITHOUT A BAND HE WOULD NOT GO IN THEY HAD NO BAND
7105-2330-0032 A QUARTER PAST TEN AND HALF PAST
7105-2330-0033 HAVE YOU ANY BAND INSTRUMENTS OF AN EVIL NATURE TO PLAY
7105-2330-0034 DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANIZER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS THOSE SORT OF THEM
7105-2330-0035 THE WARDERS HAVE A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I CAN'T ALLOW THE MEN THEMSELVES
7105-2330-0036 LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZOR
7105-2330-0037 THE POPULAR SONG OF THE MOMENT CRIED THE AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT TO THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT AND PRISONERS STRODE FORTH TO FREEDOM
7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF HIS SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0040 THEIR SEAT WAS LOST AFTER ALL BY A NARROW MATURITY
7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENSE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF WATTERBATH FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
7105-2340-0000 IN THAT NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIS HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON ONE WANTED IN ONE'S HOUSE
7105-2340-0001 WELL THAT FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID THE HUSBAND OR A DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE ESTATE
7105-2340-0002 BESIDES CYNICISM PERHAPS HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIS FAILING
7105-2340-0003 WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY NOT MERELY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVE NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THIS THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY
7105-2340-0004 WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRED PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTEREFFECTS OF A POLO INCIDENT
7105-2340-0005 A WILFRED PICHINCOT HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONORS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRED HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK
7105-2340-0006 AND THE REPUTATION WAS A UNPLEASANT ONE
7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOL DAYS ONWARDS HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF CLEPTERMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION
7105-2340-0008 THIS SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEON COLE TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THEIR CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRED SAYING HE IS PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS
7105-2340-0009 SIGNED WILFRED PIGEONCOCK
7105-2340-0010 I SUPPOSE SHE'S BRINGING US A PRESENT FOR THE SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS
7105-2340-0011 THE TASK FLITTED NERVOUSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER
7105-2340-0012 IN THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER THEIR NERVOUSNESS OR AWKWARDNESS INCREASED
7105-2340-0013 OH WE HAVEN'T SHOW YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETER SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUESTS HERE THEY ALL ARE
7105-2340-0014 SUCH NICE USEFUL GIFTS OR FEW DIPLICATES OF COURSE
7105-2340-0015 SEVEN CREAM JUG'S PUT IN PETER
7105-2340-0016 WE FEEL THAT WE MUST LIVE ON DREAM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
7105-2340-0017 OF COURSE SOME OF THEM CAN BE RAISED
7105-2340-0018 I PUT IT DOWN BY THE CLARET JUG SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER MATCH
7105-2340-0019 VIGILANCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY CROWNED WITH A SENSE OF INJURY
7105-2340-0020 AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR VISITOR MISSUS PETER EXPRESSED THE CONVICTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN SOMETHING
7105-2340-0021 HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAYS PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I'M HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY ONE OFF
7105-2340-0022 AND IS THE ONLY THING TO DO
7105-2340-0023 WILFRID WAS LATE IN COMING ROUND TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS
7105-2340-0024 IT'S AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAUX
7105-2340-0025 THERE WAS A LITTLE PRESENT FROM MY MOTHER AND MYSELF FOR YOUR SILVER WEDDING
7105-2340-0026 I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND YOU SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT RATHER AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING YOU OTHER
7105-2340-0027 THE SNATCHER HAS BEEN AN ORPHAN THESE MANY YEARS
7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNESTINE PIGEONCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPAST OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
7105-2340-0029 HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED BLANKLY AND ABSENTLY AT ONE ANOTHER
7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AS AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE ARE AT BREAKFAST
7105-2340-0031 SHE ROSE AND WENT ON HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS
7105-2340-0032 THE PIGEONCOTS HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION
7105-2340-0033 PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM IN GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
7105-2340-0034 MISSUS PETER HAD TURNED TO HER GUEST WITH CONFIDENTIAL COYNESS
7105-2340-0035 PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS IT TRANSCENDED A FAMILY GOOD LORD
7105-2340-0036 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A KLEPTOMANIA LIKE COUSINS SNATCHER
7105-2340-0037 BRAVE LITTLE MAN SAID PETER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT
7902-96591-0000 I'M FROM THE CUTTER LYING OFF THIS COAST
7902-96591-0001 DON'T CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO HIM
7902-96591-0002 AND AND YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK EXCITED TONES
7902-96591-0003 I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE
7902-96591-0004 THAT YOUR FATHER SIR RISDON GRAHAM HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE
7902-96591-0005 HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YOU COULD NOT TELL
7902-96591-0006 AND PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHIE WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARKNESS LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RATSTROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 THEN ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA GREATLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I'LL SOON SHOW THEM I'M NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WILL STOP AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THAT WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GOT BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE READY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO HIS STONE SILL
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MINUTE AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTEL PIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0018 YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED THEY COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0019 NO THAT WAS TOO BAD WE COULD NOT DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SHUT HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL WAS IN TWO PLACES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE THE PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE AND THE HEAD WOULD NOT GET FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID AND NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
7902-96592-0000 SURE YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES FATHER RIGHT
7902-96592-0001 I' M GOING HOME TO BREAKFAST

7902-96592-0004 TELL HER NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR AWAY TO NIGHT
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHIE WRAYSTROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER DREAM HE THOUGHT FOR HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TELEE THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHY DID ANDY CALL ME GURR FATHER
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LITTLE WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0010 AND I'M HUNGRY TWO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE
7902-96592-0011 NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA ON WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAN ALL AWAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RENE AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONEWORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT TO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 HREN WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE

7902-96592-0026 HE WAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE CANOE PRESENTED ITSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT THE LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THAT THIS ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EARASSAILING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPT AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK INTO ITS SHEATH
7902-96592-0032 NO I CAN'T PART WITH THAT HA HA HA ASKED THE BOY JEERINGLY

7975-280057-0020 WHEN I WAS TAKEN PRISONER I EXPECTED TO BE SHOT WITHOUT EXCEPTION
7975-280063-0000 WE TOOK THE OATHS PERHAPS THREE HUNDRED OF US DOWN ON LUTHER MASON'S FARM A FEW MILES FROM WHERE I NOW WRITE WHERE COLONEL HAYES HAD ENCAMPED AFTER INDEPENDENCE
7975-280063-0001 BOOMYOR AND MYSELF MET COFFIN AND THE REST BELOW ROSE HILL ON GRAND RIVER
7975-280063-0002 ACCORDINGLY I WAS SHORTLY WELCOME TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO LOANJACK WHERE HE WOULD PERSONALLY MAKE KNOWN THE SITUATION TO THE OTHER COLONELS
7975-280063-0003 FOSTER HAD NEARLY ONE THOUSAND CAVERMEN AND TWO PIECES OF RAB'S INDIAN A BATTERY THAT HAD ALREADY MADE FOR ITSELF A NAME FOR HARD FIGHTING
7975-280063-0004 COME IN COLONEL HAYES EXCLAIMED COLONEL COCKLES
7975-280063-0005 I THINK HE'LL BE RATHER TOUGH MEAT FOR BREAKFAST I THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT FOR DINNER
7975-280063-0006 JACKMANN WITH A PARTY OF THIRTY SEASONED MEN CHARGED THE INDIANA GUNS AND CAPTURED THEM BUT MAJOR FOSTER LED A GALLANT CHARGE AGAINST THE INVADERS AND RECAPTURED THE PIECES
7975-280063-0007 WE WERE OUT OF AMMUNITION AND WERE DOUBTLESS HAD THE FIGHT BEEN PRESSED
7975-280063-0008 THEY DID MARK MY FEELINGS IN ONE OR TWO PLACES HOWEVER
7975-280063-0009 MAJOR FOSTER IN A LETTER TO JUDGE GEORGE M BENNET TO MINNEAPOLIS SAID
7975-280063-0010 I WAS TOLD BY SOME OF OUR MEN FROM THE WESTERN BORDER OF THE STATE THAT THEY RECOGNIZED THE DARING YOUNG RIDER AS COAL YOUNGER
7975-280063-0011 ABOUT ELEVEN THIRTY A M I WAS SHOT DOWN
7975-280063-0012 THE WOUNDED OF BOTH FORCES WAS GATHERED UP AND WERE PLACED IN HOUSES
7975-280076-0000 ALTHOUGH EVERY BOOK PURPORTED TO NARRATE THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AS TOLD OF THE LIBERTY ROBBERY AND IMPLIED THAT WE HAD A PART IN IT THE YOUNGERS WERE NOT SUSPECTED AT THAT TIME NOR FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNISED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPARDS RED MARKERS AND BUD PENCE WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUANTRELL
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAID WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BLOODSHED JUDGE MC LEAN THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FAITHFULLY
7975-280076-0003 NO WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
7975-280076-0004 JUNE THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE OBICCOCK BROTHER'S BANK AT CROYD AND IOWA WAS ROBBED OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BY SEVEN MEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
7975-280076-0005 IT WAS CHARGED THAT ARTHUR MAC COY OR A C MC COY AND MYSELF HAD BEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE GAD'S HILL AFFAIR AND THE TWO STAGE ROBBERY
7975-280076-0006 A PARTS OF THIS LETTER NOW RELEVANT ARE AS FOLLOWS
7975-280076-0007 AND YOU MAY USE THIS LETTER IN YOUR OWN WAY
7975-280076-0008 I WOULD GIVE YOU THIS OUTLINE AND SKETCH OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND ACTIONS AT THE TIME OF CERTAIN ROBBERIES WITH WHICH I AM CHARGED
7975-280076-0009 AT THE TIME OF THE GALLETON BANK ROBBERING I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM PLEDES TAILOR AND RECTOR
7975-280076-0010 THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SHERIFF BERKELEY AND FIVE OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
7975-280076-0011 I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS BUT FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY
7975-280076-0012 I THEN WENT FOR ARKANSAS AND RETURNED TO SAINT CLAIR COUNTY ABOUT THE FIRST OF MAY
7975-280076-0013 I WENT TO KANSAS WHERE OUR CATTLE WERE IN WOODENSON COUNTY AT COLONEL RIDGE'S
7975-280076-0014 DURING THE SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS BUT AS THERE WAS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED THAT SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHEN I WAS
7975-280076-0015 I WENT THROUGH INDEPENDENCE AND FROM THERE TO A P WEBBS
7975-280076-0016 THERE I TOOK DINNER AND THEN WENT TO DOCTOR L W TUGHMAN'S
7975-280076-0017 OUR BUSINESS THERE WAS TO SEE E T WEST HE WAS NOT AT HOME BUT THE FAMILY WILL REMEMBER THAT WE WERE THERE
7975-280076-0018 WE CROSSED ON A BRIDGE STAYED IN THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND NEXT MORNING WE RODE UP THROUGH THE CITY
7975-280076-0019 I MET SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AND AMONG THEM WAS BOB HUDSPETH
7975-280076-0020 WE WERE NOT ON GOOD TERMS AT THAT TIME NOR HAVE WE BEEN FOR SEVEN YEARS
7975-280076-0021 POOR CHILD HE HAS BEEN HUNTED DOWN AND SHOT LIKE A WILD BEAST AND NEVER WAS A BOY MORE INNOCENT
7975-280076-0022 DOCTOR L LEWIS WAS THIS PHYSICIAN
7975-280076-0023 THERE WERE FIFTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS THERE WHO WILL TESTIFY IN ANY COURT THAT HE AND I WERE THERE
7975-280076-0024 HELVIN FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WERE ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND EITHER OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE ABOVE FOR JACK AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MISTER SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND WAS IN HIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MISTER AND MISS FICKLE AFTER THE SERVICE
7975-280076-0025 ABOUT THE LAST OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX I ARRIVED IN CARROLL PARRISH LOUISIANA
7975-280076-0026 I STAYED THERE UNTIL THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX
7975-280076-0027 I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THE TIME I WAS AT NESIO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAY
7975-280076-0028 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY IN ADARE IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY
7975-280084-0000 I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPEN WE SHOULD NOT SHOOT ANY ONE
7975-280084-0001 WHILE MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOODS BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT INTO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
7975-280084-0002 WHEN WE CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN OUR HURRY
7975-280084-0003 J S ALLEN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLERS ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
7975-280084-0004 GET YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY'RE ROBBING THE BAND
7975-280084-0005 AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BROTHERS AT THE BRIDGE THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
7975-280084-0006 ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT INTO THE BANK
7975-280084-0007 SHADWELL WOODS AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
7975-280084-0008 IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN THAT
7975-280084-0009 MEANTIME THE STREET WAS GOING UNCOMFORTABLY HOT
7975-280084-0010 EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7975-280084-0011 DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UP STAIRS IN HIS HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
7975-280084-0012 CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILLER'S MANE
7975-280084-0013 WHAT KEPT YOU SO LONG I ANSWERED PITTS
7975-280084-0014 AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THE BANK I TAKE NO ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0015 WHERE'S THE MONEY OUTSIDE THE SAFE BOB ANSWERED
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL FITZ CHASED HIM WITH A BOOT
7975-280084-0017 THE FIRST ONE MISSED HIM THEN THE SECOND WENT THROUGH HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
7975-280085-0000 THAT NIGHT IT STARTED TO RAIN AND WE WORE OUT OUR PIECES
7975-280085-0001 FRIDAY WE MOVE TOWARDS WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMP BETWEEN ELYSIUM AND GERMAN LAKE
7975-280085-0002 BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARMHOUSE CLOSE TO MANITO
7975-280085-0003 THAT DAY A MAN NAMED DUNNING RECOVERED US AND WE TOOK HIM PRISONER
7975-280085-0004 FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE NOT TO
7975-280085-0005 NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POST HASTE INTO MANITO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
7975-280085-0006 THE WHISTLE UPON THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
7975-280085-0007 HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH A PILLAR ON HIS BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
7975-280085-0008 BUT THEY SOON AFTER GOT CLEAR ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM BROKE MY WALKING STICK WITH A SHOT
7975-280085-0009 WE WAS IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG SAWED HORSES WHEN THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE ANIMALS AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
7975-280085-0010 SIX STEPS TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T OVALT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J CVENSON
7975-280085-0011 FORMING HIS LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE OF THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ROBBERS WERE DISCOVERED
7975-280085-0012 MAKE FOR THE BUSHES I SAID EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
7975-280085-0013 THERE'S NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE THERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHARGE THEM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN
7975-280085-0014 I PUT UP AS A SIGNAL FOR THE CHARGE AND WE FIRED ONE VOLLEY
7975-280085-0015 ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THEIR SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELLED ON BOB IN SPITE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS A FLAG OF TRUCE
7975-280085-0016 SHERIFF GLISPIN OF WATDOWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
7975-280085-0017 INCLUDING THOSE RECEIVED IN AND ALL THE WAY FROM NORTHFIELD I HAD ELEVEN WOUNDS
7975-280085-0018 AND SHERIFF GLISPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THAT PROTECTORATE THAT MINNESOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
8131-117016-0000 CAPTAIN MURDOK
8131-117016-0001 AND MARSPORT HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO KILL IT OFF
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THIS TYPE OF MEN
8131-117016-0003 THE STONEWALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS SEVEN HUNDRED
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DARELX AND FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORIES IN SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THERE NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR DOWN
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THEY HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0007 CAPTAIN MURDOCK WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND NOW WAS ASKING FOR MORE MONEY
8131-117016-0008 THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET THEM THROUGH HIM
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE GRIEF
8131-117016-0010 WE'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY WE WOULD ON EARTH
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERY THING NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT
8131-117016-0012 THE FIRST MAN MAKE A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THE STONE WALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
8131-117016-0013 WE PICKED OUT FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FIVE WILL COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TO NIGHT PICK ANY ROUTE THAT'S OPEN O K AGAIN LET'S GO
8131-117016-0015 BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG A STICK AND MURDOCK'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH COP
8131-117016-0016 TWO YEARS GORDON ADMITTED
8131-117016-0017 FOR A SECOND GORDON CURSED HIMSELF AND
8131-117016-0018 HE BEGAN WANDERING ABOUT SECURITY THEN
8131-117016-0019 AND NOBODY HAD TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHOR BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN THE GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE SYSTEM WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THIS FINELY TURNED CLUB IN HIS HANDS
8131-117016-0024 GORDON'S EYES HOPPED AT THAT
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWED THE SENTIMENT THAT HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVING NOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER FOUR COS HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
8131-117016-0027 HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDLEYS
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPTS STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0029 TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL TO THE WAGON
8131-117016-0030 WE'RE NOT USING WAGONS MURDOCK TOLD ME LINE THEM UP
8131-117016-0031 IF THEY WISHED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED CAREFULLY
8131-117016-0032 MURDOCK INDICATED ONE WHO SAT WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS SICK AS GORDON'S MOUTH
8131-117016-0034 I WANT A NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD THE MAN
8131-117016-0035 OH COLONEL THEY'D KILL ME I DON'T KNOW
8131-117016-0036 MURDOCK TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND TURNED TO THE WRETCHED TEFTS
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I WILL FIND YOU
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE WAS BREWING SHORTLY AFTER THOUGH
8131-117016-0039 MURDOCK SENT ONE OF THE MAN TO PICK UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD
8131-117016-0040 AND THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN WHO'D BEEN BEAT BEFORE
8131-117016-0041 GET A STARTER AND TAKE HIM WHEREVER HE BELONGS HE ORDERED
8131-117016-0042 BUT THE CAPTAIN STIRRED HARDLY SIGHING
8131-117016-0043 NO THE COPSE THEY'RE GIVING ME WE'VE COVERED GORDON
8131-117016-0044 SO THE STONEWALL GANG IS BACKING WAIN
8131-117016-0045 BUT IT S GOING TO BE TOUGH ON THEM
8131-117016-0046 BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE GOT A YELLOW TICKET FROM YOU
8131-117016-0047 MURDOCK BLINKED HE DROPPED HIS HEAD SLOWLY
8131-117016-0048 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK BLAIN WILL BE REELECTED
8131-117016-0049 NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE OF POWER
8131-117016-0050 EVER SEE A MARTIAN ELECTRON
8131-117016-0051 NO YOU'RE A FERRYSTER HE CAN'T LOSE
8131-117016-0052 AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP WHEN THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SOCIETY AND WHAT THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE MERE RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0055 COST EM MORE FOR THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE WEZZY IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE SEES IT
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEAS AND THE STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
8131-117016-0058 THE PROOFS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCK WAS TRAINING A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
8131-117016-0059 IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING WAS HE
8131-117016-0060 THIS COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D BEEN ON EARTH
8131-117016-0061 BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAIN WAS RE ELECTTED
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHOT BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORISED PRECINCT HOUSE
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANY HAD DARED RISK IT BEFORE THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117017-0002 AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT CLAYEY'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117017-0003 GORDON HIT THE SIGNALS SWITCH AND THE MARS SPEAKER LET OUT A SHRILL WHISTLE
8131-117017-0004 GUNS SUDDENLY SEEMED TO BE FLOURISHING EVERYBODY
8131-117017-0005 HE CAN'T DO IT TO ME
8131-117017-0006 I'M REFORMED I'M GETTING STRAIGHT

8131-117017-0008 ONE LOOK WAS ENOUGH THE WORK PAPERS HAD THE TELLTALE OVER THICKENING OF A SIGNATURE THAT HAD SHOWED UP ON OTHER PAPERS OBVIOUSLY FORGERIES
8131-117017-0009 SOME TURNED AWAY AS GORDON AND THE OTHER COPE WENT TO WORK BUT MOST OF THEM WEREN'T SQUEAMISH
8131-117017-0010 WHEN IT WAS OVER THE TWO PICKED UP THEIR WHIMMERING CAPTIVE
8131-117017-0011 JENKINS THE OTHER COPP HAVE BEEN HOLDING THE WALLET
8131-117017-0012 MUST HAVE BEEN MAKING A BIG KNOT IN SOMETHING FIFTY FIFTY
8131-117017-0013 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OVER TWO THOUSAND CREDITORS IN THE WALLET
8131-117017-0014 WHEN GORDON AND JENKINS CAME BACK MURDOCK TOSSED THE MONEY TO THEM SPLIT UP
8131-117017-0015 WHATEVER COMES TO HAND AND GOVERNOR

8131-117017-0028 THE KIDS POCKETED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY NODDING
8131-117017-0029 THE LITTLE GUY KNEW MARS AS FEW OTHERS DID AFTERWARDS FROM ALL SIDES
8131-117017-0030 AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COPPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN IT ISSY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USE THE INFORMATION WITH A BEAT SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT TO THE UPPER BRACKETS HE'D STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS
8131-117017-0031 THE CAPTAIN LOOKED COMPLETELY BEATEN AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM AND DROPPED ONTO THE DESK

8188-269288-0028 SHE LOOKED FROM THE ROOM

8188-269288-0033 LISLIE LEFT THE ROOM BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY GONE A DOZEN PACES DOWN THE CORRIDOR BEFORE SHE MET ANNE RETURNING
8188-269288-0034 ANNIE'S EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT HER CHEEKS WERE NO LONGER PALE AND THERE WAS A BRILLIANT LIGHT IN THEM

8188-269288-0052 ANNIE'S SMILE WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS
8188-269288-0053 ANNIE DID NOT MEAN TO CONFIDE ON ANY ONE THAT NIGHT AND THE KINDEST THING WAS TO LEAVE HER ALONE
8188-269288-0054 TIRED OUT LIZZLEY HERSELF DROPPED ASLEEP
8188-269288-0055 ANNIE IS THAT YOU SHE CALLED

8188-269290-0033 BUT MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LIZLI AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
8188-269290-0034 MISS LAUDERDALE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHER TUTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE HALLS ON A RAISED PLATFORM
8188-269290-0035 THEN A RUDE CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE WAS ANY COLCHESTER
8188-269290-0036 THE PHYSICAL PART OF YOUR TRAINING AND ALSO THE MENTAL PART ARE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED IN THIS GREAT BODY OF LEARNING SHE CONTINUED BUT THE SPIRITUAL PART IT SEEMS TO ME OUGHT NOW TO BE STRENGTHENED
8188-269290-0037 HERE HERE AS ONCE AGAIN HERE

8188-269290-0048 AFTER THE ADDRESS THE SOLDIERS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
8188-269290-0049 IT WAS AFTER TEN O'CLOCK WHEN SHE LEFT THE HALL
8188-269290-0050 JUST AS SHE WAS DOING SO MISS FRERE CAME UP AND
8188-269290-0051 ANNIE COLCHESTER WAS YOUR ROOMFELLOW IS SHE NOT SHE SAID
8188-269290-0052 I SEE BY YOUR FACE MISS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DISTURBED ABOUT SOMETHING ARE YOU KEEPING ANYTHING BACK
8188-269290-0053 I AM AFRAID I AM REPLIED LIZZIE DISTRESSED NOW BY HER TONE
8188-269290-0054 I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS MORDERDALE EXCEPT A VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED HERSELF
8188-269290-0055 EXCUSES MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO
8188-269290-0056 THE GIRL WHO BREAKS THAT RULES HAS TO BE PUNISHED
8188-269290-0057 I WILL KILL HER
8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THAT TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHILE THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS FATHER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MONTNOS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICIALS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE PRACTICAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0004 WHETHER THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER IT
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW A FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME UPON MYSELF
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION WAKE THOSE SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UP A COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVE LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALLS FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0007 HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOUR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE CONWEALTH
8188-274364-0008 MY LORDS I HAVE NOW TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG VANE FOLLOWING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THE MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO PIM WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY FOR HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL THE RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT
8280-266249-0000 OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANT IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DETERMINED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOUR
8280-266249-0003 AT LAST THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0004 THERE ARE MANY NICE LOOKING PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0005 BESIDES OTHERS ADDED COUSIN RONALD LAUGHING
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ANSWERED THIS LITTLE GROUP YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I SUPPOSE
8280-266249-0007 AND WHAT A PRETTY LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR HERALD I SHOULD JUDGE
8280-266249-0008 DO YOU SON WAS THAT SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009 HE SIMPLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE BOY
8280-266249-0010 SUPPOSE YOU AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRED
8280-266249-0011 I DO INDEED THOUGH PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF THAT AILMENTS
8280-266249-0012 DOUBTLESS THAT IT IS THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMAN'S CABIN WHERE THERE'S THE LIGHT
8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS I FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACTING TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF A DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED OR ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0017 IS IT NOT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENTS
8280-266249-0018 THAT THE FRESH POLYTECHNICA INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS UPON THE MIND
8280-266249-0019 NOTICE THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND HEWERS
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES APPEAR WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0021 AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRSTS WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0022 HENCE HIS RESORT TO CIDER AND BEER
8280-266249-0023 NO SIR WHY KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN
8280-266249-0024 FOR YE ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE AND THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GODS
8280-266249-0025 WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR CITIES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES WITH A LIVING SACRIFICE WHOLLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THAT INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALY
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY BROTHERS SHOULD PERISH AND NOT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAS BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0030 THEY ARE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MEN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0031 THE EYES OF THAT WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION
8280-266249-0032 NO DEAR HE IS NOT HERE
8280-266249-0033 AND HER DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TOO
8280-266249-0034 NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD IMMEDIATELY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0035 HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WILD EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING TO HIS STATEROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0036 WHAT DOES IT MEAN CRIED JOHN

8280-266249-0040 WHO ASKED THE MATE I'VE SEEN NONE UP HERE THOUGH THERE WERE SOME IN THE STEERAGE
8280-266249-0041 THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOODS
8280-266249-0042 A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET HE SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0043 LET ME LOOK YELLED WARD MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIS ARMS
8280-266249-0044 I DINKS NO I DINKS I DID YOU VON LESSER RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
8280-266249-0045 THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE FATHER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0046 MISTER LILLBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0047 HERE THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSION
8280-266249-0048 YOU KEPT IT UP TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT
8280-266249-0049 WHEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN HIS STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0050 AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STAKES ARE VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0051 THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYES UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREEN BACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRING TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND
8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS WITH A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGHTER
8280-266249-0054 IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED WARD LOOK WHAT'S THERE LOOK HERE
8280-266249-0055 WHAT CAN IT HAVE BEEN THEY SAID EACH OTHER

8280-266249-0057 IT WAS THE LAST GAME OF CARDS FOR THAT TIP
8280-266249-0058 THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THAT MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0059 TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECOMING EVIDENT THAT THE DAILIES WERE IN VERY STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0060 OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAD BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE

8461-258277-0016 HE REPLIED I HAVE FORTY TALENTS BUT THEY ARE IN CAIRO
8461-278226-0000 AND LAURA HAD THEIR OWN PET PLANS
8461-278226-0001 SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED THE SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WEAR THE NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JUVIN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM FOR HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-278226-0003 I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES THE MARTIAN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
8461-278226-0004 I REMEMBER ALL THE REUBENS SAYS AT THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHILE I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
8461-278226-0005 SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE A SPRING SKY WITH POOR GREY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOLS AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AYESHA BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0006 IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS WAS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0007 BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID HE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN IN THE GALLERY
8461-278226-0008 PHILIP JOCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HIS WIFE MADE HER DISCOVERY
8461-278226-0009 HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE AND PHILIP LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
8461-278226-0010 I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MOURNING ROOM AT JOCELYN STROLL
8461-278226-0011 SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ARTIST PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KIRSTORE LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
8461-278226-0012 THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DID NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF OF THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
8461-278226-0013 BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSH CRITICAL TOWARDS THE WORKS OF OTHERS
8461-278226-0014 I DON'T THINK HE WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THAT HOUSE
8461-278226-0015 YOU WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOR FELLOW IF YOU'LL SAY YES
8461-281231-0000 HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARDS TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THE WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS
8461-281231-0001 IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORQUALSTONE
8461-281231-0002 AS HE LAY UPON THIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH THE FEAR OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
8461-281231-0003 WHAT ART THOU HE SHOUTED IN TERROR
8461-281231-0004 LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH EUREKA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
8461-281231-0005 EXCLAIMED THE LIEUTENANT HO

8461-281231-0007 THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID EURICAKA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO WOULD EXTINGUISH THEM
8461-281231-0008 MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIOLENT WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
8461-281231-0009 THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY THE BRAY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
8461-281231-0010 THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCED ITS WAY INWARD IN SPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
8461-281231-0011 TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEIR LEADER'S EFFORTS TO START THEM
8461-281231-0012 THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOFS OF THE HALL WRUNG WITH THE FURIOUS BLOWS
8461-281231-0013 AT LENGTH DE BRACY FELL IN
8461-281231-0014 TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK THY PLEASURE OR ME
8461-281231-0015 YET FIRST LET ME ASK SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS THEE TO KNOW
8461-281231-0016 EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER AND PERISH YOU
8461-281231-0017 THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAIR
8461-281231-0018 RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITHERS THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS
8461-281231-0019 BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT FRENCH DE BOEUF
8461-281231-0020 AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE UUREAKA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
8461-281231-0021 BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND ROLLED THROUGH THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTERS
8461-281231-0022 AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED HER IRON
8461-281231-0023 WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORKELEDEN CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
8461-281231-0024 HE LEFT A GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF KONIGSBURG AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ADDLESTEIN WAS LAID
8461-281231-0025 DE BRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF INTO A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOOD
8461-281231-0026 HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN IRISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT AS A MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING
8461-281231-0027 SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS STRONG WAR HORSE AND RODE OUT THROUGH THE FOREST
8461-281231-0028 DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAACS OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER REBECCA
8461-281231-0029 AND WITH THIS EPISTLE AN UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
8461-281231-0030 THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FROM DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH THEM
8461-281231-0031 HE APPEALED TO THE BACY TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
8461-281231-0032 BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LYCAS DE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISITS TO THE PRECEPTORY
8461-281231-0033 HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH WOMEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
8461-281231-0034 POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD OR DISREGARDED
8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIENDS IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK AROUND AND TO MARK INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
8461-281231-0036 SHE GAZED ACCORDINGLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR FROM A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
8461-281231-0037 AT HIS FEET WAS PLACED THE TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO REPORT THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
8461-281231-0038 THE PRECEPTORS OF WHICH THERE WERE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THEIR SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
