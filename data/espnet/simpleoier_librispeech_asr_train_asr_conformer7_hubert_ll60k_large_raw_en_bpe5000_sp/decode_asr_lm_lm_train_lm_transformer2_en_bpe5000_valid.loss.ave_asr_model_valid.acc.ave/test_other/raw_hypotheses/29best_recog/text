1688-142285-0000 THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS AS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUESTS DOWN STAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOYS
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SIMPLE
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKED THAT PART OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS THE THING I LOVED BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO ARE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AS HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE THAT YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT THOSE PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 HIS FATHER DIES IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON THE WORKHOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE IT COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF THE WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE WENT FORWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISTER THORNTON IS NOT WONT I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LEFT GILTON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED HAD HER FATHER
1688-142285-0016 OH PAPA HAD THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THIS MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN ROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES THEM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER THOUGHT THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WITH HIS WORDS
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MACHINES AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE HOUSE SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER OUT IT CAME TO
1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO YOU THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0025 AND I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHINGLY
1688-142285-0026 I PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL
1688-142285-0027 I DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO AND ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0028 BUT YOU GOOD NIGHT CHILD
1688-142285-0029 THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS ADAM
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN THE BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON HAD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR THE STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER BROTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF ITS MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER SHOULD HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW PEOPLE IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND OFFERED TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL MISSY HOW WERE YOU
1688-142285-0038 BETTER THOUGH NOT BETTER IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
1688-142285-0039 NOT EXACTLY THAT REPLIED MARGARET SMILING
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER AND NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AN TIRED OF MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND OF BOOLAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AN I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED ABOUT TO WALK LONG SIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
1688-142285-0042 BUT FOR ONE MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0043 AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE A
1688-142285-0044 BESSES DO YOU WISH TO DIE
1688-142285-0045 BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO BEFORE SHE REPLIED
1688-142285-0046 NOT A WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
1688-142285-0047 SO WHAT WAS IT
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MIDDLETON
1688-142285-0049 I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET KINDLY
1688-142285-0050 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY AND MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW
1688-142285-0051 THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND TREMBLING GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY CAME UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
1688-142285-0053 YOU'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAK'S A BIT GROOVISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0054 BUT MISSUS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
1688-142285-0055 GASPED BESSY THE LAST
1688-142285-0056 BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN RAN BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR CAN HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT TO YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT
1688-142285-0059 THEN I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED TOO
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVES IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0061 I CAN BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
1688-142285-0062 THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG OLD WOMAN
1688-142285-0063 I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY AN BIG DEAL
1688-142285-0064 BUT WHO'S COME AT LAST AND WHO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HE'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT WHO KNOWS NOBODY ABOUT
1688-142285-0065 IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HARD TO REACH
1688-142285-0066 BUT THE GIRL THEN HE PLAYED IT THE MORE WITH MARGARET
1688-142285-0067 DON'T THINK HARDLY ON HIM HE S A GOOD MAN HE IS
1688-142285-0068 I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOGGED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF EITHER IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0069 THE FEVERISH COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEKS AND THE FEVERISH GLEAM INTO HER EYE
1688-142285-0070 BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL SAY MY HEART
1688-142285-0071 SHE PUT HER HAND TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALER
1688-142285-0072 MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEART TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
1688-142285-0073 PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND THEN BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL BUT TO SAY IT
1688-142285-0075 I'LL COME BACK TO MORROW SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0076 MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTLESS
1688-142285-0077 SHE WAS LATE FOR TEA ON HOME
1688-142285-0078 HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERVANT POOR
1688-142285-0079 NO MAMMA THE ANNE BUCKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
1688-142285-0080 S'POSE'LL TRY SAID MISTER HALE
1688-142285-0081 EVERYBODY ELSE HAS HAD THEIR TURN AT THIS GREAT DIFFICULTY NOW LET ME CRY
1688-142285-0082 I MAY BE THE CINDERELLA TO PUT UPON THE SLIPPER AFTER ALL
1688-142285-0083 WHAT WOULD YOU DO MADAME HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT IT
1688-142285-0084 WELL I I WILL APPLY IT TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS
1688-142285-0085 IS VERY GOOD BUT WE MUST FIRST CATCH OUR HOUSE MOTHER
1688-142285-0086 THE MOTHER OF WHOM HE SPOKE TO US SAID COMRADE
1688-142285-0087 MISTER THORNTON THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS HAD I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HALE QUIETLY
1688-142285-0088 I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER AND SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
1688-142285-0089 PERHAPS HE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
1688-142285-0090 SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ONLY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
1688-142285-0091 MY DEAR SAID MISTER HALE ALARMED PRAY DON'T GO OFF ON THAT AFFAIR
1688-142285-0092 AND I AM SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1688-142285-0093 TAKE NOTICE THAT THIS IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I WOULDN'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT
1688-142285-0094 I DON'T KNOW POSITIVELY THAT IT IS HERS EITHER BUT FROM LITTLE THINGS I HAVE GATHERED FROM HIM I FANCY NOT

1998-29454-0004 WHEN DICKIE CAME DOWN HIS AUNT SLOWLY SLAPPED HIM AND HE TOOK THE HALFPENNY AND LIMPED OFF OBEDIENTLY
1998-29454-0005 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE AND IT INTERESTED HER EXTREMELY

1998-29455-0037 NOR WAS IT SUNDAY ON WHICH THEY TOOK A REST AND WASHED THE SHIRTS ACCORDING TO MISTER BEALE'S RULE OF LIFE
1998-29455-0038 THEY DID NOT STAY THERE BUT WALKED OUT ACROSS THE DOWNS WHERE THE SKYLARKS WERE SINGING AND ON A DIP OF THE DOWNS CAME UP GREAT STONE WALLS AND TOWERS VERY STRONG AND GREY

2033-164914-0007 AND HE ALSO IMPROVISED THE TWO FOLLOWING DISTIS
2033-164914-0008 WHEN NUSHAT AL ZAMAN HEARD THE FIRST IMPROVISATION SHE CALLED TO MIND HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER AND HER BROTHER AND THEIR WILHELM HOME THEN SHE WEPT AND CRIED TO THE EUNUCH AND SAID TO HIM WOE TO THEE

2033-164914-0014 BUT THE EUNUCH SAID I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE TILL THOU SHOW ME WHO IT WAS THAT RECITED THE VERSES FOR I DREAD RETURNING TO THY LADY WITHOUT HIM
2033-164914-0015 NOW WHEN THE FIREMAN HEARD THESE WORDS HE FEARED FOR ZAL AL MAKAN AND WEPT WITH EXCEEDING WEEPING AND SAID TO THE EUNUCH BY ALLAH IT WAS NOT I AND I KNOW IT NOT

2033-164914-0018 I SAY WHAT MADE MY IGNOMINY WHATE'ER THE BITTER CUP I DRAIN FAR BE FROM ME THY NIGHT TO FLEE NOR WILL I BOW TO THOSE WHO BLAME AND FOR SUCH LOVE WOULD DEAL ME SHAME
2033-164914-0019 THEN SAID THE EUNUCH TO ZAU AL MAKAN PEACE BE WITH THEE OH MY LORD
2033-164914-0020 O MY LORD CONTINUED THE EUNUCH AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY A PERMITTED SAY

2033-164915-0000 AND WHAT SO THESE
2033-164915-0001 THEN SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HE GATHERED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN FELL DOWN DOWN IN A FAINTING FIT
2033-164915-0002 WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW THIS CASE HE WANDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEWHAT TO COVER THEM WAITED TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
2033-164915-0003 AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND UZORT AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LEFT HER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THESE VERSES
2033-164915-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANTS HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM BUT HOW HE HAD GOT FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BUYING HOW HE HAD MADE THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD GONE IN TO HER AND HOW THE KING THEIR SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARKAN
2033-164915-0005 BUT NOW GO TO THY MATTER AND BRING HIM QUICKLY TO ME
2033-164915-0006 THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED A CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO ACCORDINGLY SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE STOCKER TILL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRDLING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
2033-164915-0007 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE STALKER GIRDED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING OH WOULD I KNEW WHAT WAS BECOME OF HIM
2033-164915-0008 I BELIEVE HE HATH DENOUNCED ME TO THE EUNUCH HENCE THOSE PAGES AT ABOUT ME AND HE HATH MADE ME AN ACCOMPLICE IN HIS CRIME
2033-164915-0009 WHY DIDST THOU SAY I HAD NEVER REPEATED THESE COUPLETS NOR DO I KNOW WHO REPEATED THEM WHEN IT WAS THY COMPANION
2033-164915-0010 BUT NOW I WOULD NOT LEAVE THEE BETWEEN THIS PLACE AND BAGHDAD AND WHAT BETIDETH THY COMRADE SHALL BETIDE THEE
2033-164915-0011 TWAS AS I FEARED THE COMING ILLS DISCERNING BUT UNTO ALLAH WE ARE ALL TURNING
2033-164915-0012 THEN THE EUNUCH CRIED UPON THE PAGES SAYING TAKE HIM ON THE ASS
2033-164915-0013 AND HE ANSWERED I AM THE CHAMBERLAIN OF THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS KING SHARKAN SON OF OMAR BIN AL NUMAN LORD OF VAHDAD AND OF THE LAND OF KHORASAN AND I BRING TRIBUTE AND PRESENTS FROM HIM TO HIS FATHER IN BAGHDAD
2033-164915-0014 SO FARE YE FORWARDS NO HARM SHALL BEFALL YOU TILL YOU JOIN HIS GRAND WAZIR DAND
2033-164915-0015 THEN HE BADE HIM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO THE KING OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND THE TRIBUTE OF SYRIA
2033-164915-0016 SO IT WAS ARRANGED THAT WE GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARRKAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHER'S REALM
2033-164915-0017 AND AMONGST THEM WERE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE CADET ZAU AL MAKAN FOR QUOTH THEY HIS NAME BE LIGHT OF THE PLACE AND HE HATH A SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HARIS THE DELIGHT OF THE TIME BUT THEY SET OUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOR ALHIJAZ AND NONE WOTTETH WHAT IS BECOME OF THEM
2033-164916-0000 SO HE TURNED TO THE WAZIR DANDAN AND SAID TO HIM VERILY YOUR TALE IS THE WONDER OF WONDERS
2033-164916-0001 KNOW O CHIEF WAZIR THAT HERE WHERE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED ME ALLAH HATH GIVEN YOU REST FROM FATIGUE AND BRINGETH YOU YOUR DESIRE AFTER THE EASIEST OF FASHIONS FOR THAT HIS ALMIGHTY WILL RESTORETH TO YOU ZALOWMA KHAN AND HIS SISTER NUZHAD AL ZAMAN WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN
2033-164916-0002 WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAYNE TELLS ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFELL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
2033-164916-0003 ZAUMARKAN BOWED HIS HEAD A WHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THE POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM ON THE RIGHT WAY
2033-164916-0004 AND HE ADDED OH MY UNCLE HOW SHALL I DO WITH MY BROTHER SHARRKAN
2033-164916-0005 AFTER A WHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE PURE TIDE SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
2033-164916-0006 WHEN IT WAS THE SEVENTY EIGHTH NIGHT HE
2033-164916-0007 AND IN IT ALL REJOICED AT THE PROCESSION OF THE LIGHT OF THE PLACE
2033-164916-0008 LASTLY THE MINISTER WENT IN AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE ZA AL MAKAN WHO ROSE TO MEET HIM SAYING WELCOME O WAZIR AND SIRE'S SONSPIERRE
2033-164916-0009 MOREOVER THE SULTAN COMMANDED HIS WAZIR DINDAN TO CALL A TEN DAYS HALT OF THE ARMY THAT HE MIGHT BE PRIVATE WITH HIM AND LEARN FROM HIM HOW AND WHEREFORE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN SLAIN
2033-164916-0010 HE THEN REPAIRED TO THE HEART OF THE ENCAMPMENT AND ORDERED THE HOSTE TO HALT TEN DAYS
2414-128291-0000 WHAT HATH HAPPENED UNDER ME
2414-128291-0001 HE ASKED HIMSELF SOMETHING WARM AND LIVING QUICKENETH ME HE MUST BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
2414-128291-0002 WHEN HOWEVER ZATHUSTRA WAS QUITE NIGH UNTO THEM THEN DID HE HEAR PLAINLY THAT THE HUMAN VOICE SPAKE IN THE MIDST OF THE CAIRN AND APPARENTLY ALL OF THEM HAD TURNED THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THE SPEAKER

2414-128291-0021 SAYS ZARATHUSTRA THOU SHOULDST ALSO SEE MINE ANIMALS MINE EAGLE AND MY SERPENT THEIR ALIKE DO NOT AT PRESENT EXIST ON EARTH
2414-128291-0022 AND TALK TO MINE ANIMALS OF THE HAPPINESS OF THEMSELVES

2414-128292-0008 ALSO METHINKETH THAT AFTER ALL IT HATH LONG AND LESS THAN MINE
2414-128292-0009 FOR WHEN THE ATHUSTRA SCRUTINISED HIM WITH HIS GLANCE HE WAS FRIGHTENED AS BY A SUDDEN APPARITION SO SLENDER SWARTHY HOLLOW AND WORN OUT DID HIS FOLLOWER APPEAR
2414-128292-0010 ASKED ATHUSTRA VEHEMENTLY WHAT DOEST THOU HERE

2414-128292-0012 THOU'RT NOT PLEASING UNTO ME

2414-128292-0015 WHEN THE DEVIL CASTETH HIS SKIN DOTH NOT HIS NAME ALSO FALL AWAY IT'S ALSO SKIN
2414-128292-0016 THE DEVIL HIMSELF IS PERHAPS A KING
2414-128292-0017 SOMETIMES I MEANT TO LIE AND BUILD
2414-128292-0018 THUS ONLY DID I HIT THE TRUTH
2414-128292-0019 HOW HAVE I SEEN INCLINATIONS
2414-128292-0020 HAVE I STILL A SOUL
2414-128292-0021 A HAVEN TOWARDS WHICH MY SAIL HAS SET
2414-128292-0022 FOR ME TOO I ASK AND SEEK AND HAVE SOUGHT BUT I HAVE NOT FOUND IT
2414-128292-0023 O ETERNAL EVERYWHERE O ETERNAL NOWHERE O ETERNAL AND IN VAIN
2414-128292-0024 THOU ART MY OWN SHADOW
2414-128292-0025 SAID HE AT LAST SADLY YOU
2414-128292-0026 THY DANGER IS NOT SMALL THOU FREE SPIRIT AND A WANDERER
2414-128292-0027 THEY SLEEP QUIETLY THEY WILL ENJOY THEIR NEW SECURITY
2414-128292-0028 BEWARE LEST IN THE END A NARROW FAITH CAPTURED THEE A HARD RIGOROUS DELUSION
2414-128292-0029 FOR NOW EVERYTHING THAT IS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND CONTEMPTETH THEE
2414-128292-0030 THOU HAST JUST LOST THY GOAL
2414-128292-0031 THOU POOR ROVER AND RAMBLER THOU TIRED BUTTERFLY I
2414-128292-0032 WILLT THOU HAVE A REST AND A HOME THIS EVENING
2414-159411-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAHMIN WHO WAS WANDERING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM
2414-159411-0001 THE BRAHMIN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THE CAGE YOU WILL KILL ME
2414-159411-0002 O FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN THIS TRUTH THAT I WILL NOT
2414-159411-0003 I WILL NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATERS AND RETURN
2414-159411-0004 THEN THE BRAHMIN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE TURNED OVER THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARDS
2414-159411-0005 SO THE BRAHMIN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A BANDAN TREE AND THE BRAHMIN SAID TO IT BANNANT TREE BANNON TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0006 ON WHAT MUST I GIVE A JUDGMENT ASKED THE BANDANT TREE
2414-159411-0007 HIS TIGER SAID THE BRAMIN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF HIS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LEFT HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME
2414-159411-0008 IT IS JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR YOU
2414-159411-0009 LET THE TIGER EAT OF THE MAN FOR MEN ARE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE
2414-159411-0010 SIR CAMEL SIR CAMELS CRIED THE BRAHMAN HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0011 AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND A BULLOCK LYING BY THE ROADSIDE AND
2414-159411-0012 IS IT FAIR THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR THAT
2414-159411-0013 LET THE TIGER EAT OF THE MAN FOR MEN HAVE NO PITY
2414-159411-0014 THREE OUT OF THE SIX AND GIVE JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMIN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINE TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
2414-159411-0015 ON WHAT MUST I GIVE CREDIT ASKED THE EAGLE
2414-159411-0016 THE BRAHMIN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY THE LITTLE ONES
2414-159411-0017 THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID JUDGMENT OF ALL IS AGAINST YOU OLD BRAHMAN
2414-159411-0018 AFTER THIS THEY SAW AN ALLIGATION AND THE BRAHMIN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVORABLE VERDICT
2414-159411-0019 BUT THE ALLIGATORS SAID THAT WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KILL ME
2414-159411-0020 THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK HER OPINION OF THE SIXTH JUDGE
2414-159411-0021 HERE THE SIXTH WAS A JACKAL
2414-159411-0022 THE BRAHMIN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKO UNCLE JACKO SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0023 SHOW ME THE POSITION
2414-159411-0024 AND THE GUARDS THERE THE JAKAL SAID NOW BRAHMIN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD
2414-159411-0025 AND EXACTLY THERE WAS IT ASKED THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0026 EXACTLY HERE REPLIED THE BRAGMIN
2414-159411-0027 WHERE WAS A TIVER THEN
2414-159411-0028 WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE TIGER JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS UPON THIS SIDE
2414-159411-0029 VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL BUT I CANNOT JUDGE WITHOUT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY
2414-159411-0030 SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE BRABIN
2414-159411-0031 THEN SHUT AND BOLTED IT SAID THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0032 WHEN A BRAHMIN HAD DONE THIS THE JACKALS SAID OH YOU WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL TIGER
2414-159411-0033 WHEN A GOOD BRAHMIN OPENED YOUR CASE DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WILL MAKE
2414-159411-0034 PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEY FRIEND MAHMAN
2414-159411-0035 YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY AND MY MIND THIS
2414-165385-0000 THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUET AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLATTERING PAQUET BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILISED MONKEY
2414-165385-0001 THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS INSTANCED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMIC WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW HOLD BEFORE YOU
2609-156975-0000 THEN MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS TRUE
2609-156975-0001 HOWDORNE HOPHAEST HODOUBT PAINS SINCE HIS GENIUS
2609-156975-0002 LET'S HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MATRON MAY AND IN THAT FAITH LET IT'S DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
2609-156975-0003 THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THE PONDAGE
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHOSE TURBANT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KIERNAPATH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST PABLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIANS AND SCRIPZONS GIVE OF THIS PERIOD
2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF THE DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ALTAMIQUE COVETTES INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES PROBABLY TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDO WERE THE CHIEF FACTORS IN THIS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAELS HISTORY
2609-156975-0008 THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATIONS OF A SOJOURN IN EGYPT
2609-156975-0009 THE LATER PHYSICIANS SENT TO EXTEND THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY PATOM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATUM
2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY IN SCRIPT AND ULCES STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHAM THE HOUSE OF RAMESES A CITY WITH THE ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES
2609-156975-0012 THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS TYRANNY WAS NATURALLY INTELLIGIBLE
2609-156975-0013 WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM IT THE DESPOTIC ROAR OF THE LAND A DAY
2609-156975-0014 I THE MAKING OF A LOYAL PATRIOT
2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES'S BIRTH AND HIS EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
2609-156975-0016 WHAT'S MOSES'S JUST FINDIN RESISTIN THE GYPSIN TAX MASTER
2609-156975-0017 IS PANIONAGE ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
2609-156975-0018 NOWT'REE HE WENT TO THE LAND O MIDIAN
2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTANS AND FUGITIVES
2609-156975-0020 FROM ABOUT TO TWO THOUSAND B C
2609-156975-0021 ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIS HOSPITABLY
2609-156975-0022 THESE SAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KIDAM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHEN HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO A COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN THE TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0024 THE SCORE OF THE WENDINESS
2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSE TOO PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUATE
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIESTS OF THE SUBTRIBE OF THE KINITS RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0027 NOTE THE CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF MORALS
2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS THE LEADER AND DEVELOPER OF HIS PEOPLE
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT UP WITH THE SURROUNDING TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KINITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAAWAY OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GUIDE WAS TRANSLATED BY A LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0031 DO THE EARLIEST SIBREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0032 THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST MINISTER'D AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0033 MOSES IN THE HOME OF THE MENDIAN PRIESTS WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0034 THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE POWERFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
2609-156975-0035 HIS QUEST WAS FOR AJUTS AND STRONG GONE ABLE TO DEVOUR THE OPPRESSED
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES OF THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENS HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON A POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST AND TONNIAN PLAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA MINOR SERIL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVEN SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
2609-156975-0038 THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESSES AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES'S CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP IN ACTION
2609-157645-0000 EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PRESENT FOR THE ROYAL FOE ARE TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
2609-157645-0001 THOUGH PROHIBITION IN THE REGUISING QUOD AT A SMOAKING IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
2609-157645-0002 SOMETIMES TOBACCO IS USED IN CHURCH FOR DISINFECTANT OR DEODORIZED PURPOSES
2609-157645-0003 BLACKBURN ART'S BISCET OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER
2609-157645-0004 ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH NICKINGHAM FOR A CONFIRMMASON
2609-157645-0005 ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR BARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER DIDNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTERY AT HATTON
2609-157645-0006 HE WAS SUCH A CONTINUOUS SMOKER THAT ANY ONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HADN'T NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF A PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENSE
2609-157645-0007 ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITSFIELD HE HANDED MASTER PIPE AND JOSTLEER THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING THEM PATIENT
2609-157645-0008 THEM THINGS SING ANOTHER PSALMS SAID THE CURATE
2609-157645-0009 THEY HAVE SIR REPLIED THE COLONEL
2609-157645-0010 THEN LET THEM SING THE HUNDRED AND NINETEENTH REPLIED THE CUR
2609-157645-0011 SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AND AS MANY TOBACCO PILES AS TO THE MAN OF OFFICE
2609-157645-0012 DAVID DEANE SAVOR DENY AT ALL PROVED THIS IRREVERENT
2609-157645-0013 GOING TO CHURCH SAINT HALE'S IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN A QUAINT IN THE SIGNING EXPERIENCED
2609-157645-0014 WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCES FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
2609-169640-0000 PARROTS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY THE SCEPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE C'EST FOUR OF THEM AND FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACT OF VIOLENCE
2609-169640-0001 AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT GENTLY KEPT THE STEERAGE WAY ON THE SHIP
2609-169640-0002 FORTUNATELY THE JOHN WAS NOT ONLY FAT BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS A LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS IN AN UNLIVELY DANCE
2609-169640-0003 I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SIP POTSY SPECTS REE IN MODERATE WEATHER
2609-169640-0004 MISTER MARVELL HE I DO B'LIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HINCOOPS BEIN LIKE THE SAILORS AS ONE MIGHT SAY BERY ASLEEP
2609-169640-0005 AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE WHEN FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN THEIR BOAT
2609-169640-0006 A SING OUT SAIL HO AND CLOSE ABOARD
2609-169640-0007 BUT HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
2609-169640-0008 ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET AT OUR TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
2609-169640-0009 AS OUR SEATS WERE ALL LYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME A LEASURE TO LOOK ABOUT
2609-169640-0010 I SOON SAW BOTH QUANTZ AND GREAT ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER
2609-169640-0011 MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS ALSO AND REMARKED THAT MY MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCAL'S ABACK
2609-169640-0012 A COMFORT STILLNESS SUCCEEDED
2609-169640-0013 THE PROKES DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED IT FAST
2609-169640-0014 I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING PIPES NOW AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
2609-169640-0015 KAI WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
2609-169640-0016 THE STILLNESS THAT REIGNED IN BOTH SIDES WAS LIKE THAT OF DEATH
2609-169640-0017 THE SERGEANT BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME ROUND LIKE A TAR
2609-169640-0018 BUT THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER WE COULD PASS THEM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
2609-169640-0019 THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INCIDENT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE IN THE CLOSEST SENT TO HIS ORDERS
2609-169640-0020 NOT A SOUL ON BOARD THE JON WAS HURT
2609-169640-0021 ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMAN THE FOUR SIXES TWO OUT OF THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERNMOST PROWA WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
2609-169640-0022 THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN ANGUISH OF
2609-169640-0023 I DOUBT IF WE'D TOUCH THE MAN IN THE NEAREST THOROUGH
2609-169640-0024 IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD OF HER CANVAS'S BINNED FORE LEAVING THE POORER MOSTCENOUS IN HER WAY
3005-163389-0000 THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHIRTON'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK FOR THE NOISE
3005-163389-0001 SOME SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TURN DOWN THE FENCE
3005-163389-0002 THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY AND UNPLEASANT
3005-163389-0003 SHEIRBURN RUN HIS EYE SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUTGAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
3005-163389-0004 THE AVERAGE MAN'S A COWARD TOO
3005-163389-0005 BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE MAN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOOT ME IN THE BACK IN THE DARK AND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
3005-163389-0006 SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT IT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH A HUNDRED MASKED COWARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
3005-163389-0007 OH YOU DIDN'T WANT TO COME
3005-163389-0008 BUT A MOB WITHOUT ANY MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT IS BENEATH A PITIFULNESS
3005-163389-0009 NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN OUT ACROSS HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS THIS
3005-163389-0010 THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AND THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AND BUCK HARKNESS HE HEALED IT AFTER THEM LOOKING INTOLERABLE CHEER
3005-163389-0011 YOU CAN'T BE TOO CHEERFUL
3005-163389-0012 THEY ARGUED AND TRIED TO KEEP HIM OUT BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE WHOLE SHOW GONE TO A STANDSTILL
3005-163389-0013 AND ONE OR TWO WOMEN BEGAN TO GROAN
3005-163389-0014 SO THEN THE RING MASTER HERE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSE
3005-163389-0015 IT WARN'T FUNNY TO ME THOUGH I WAS ALL OF A TREMBLE TO SEE MY DANGER
3005-163389-0016 AN THE HORN A GOIN LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE TOO

3005-163390-0000 ANN BUT NEVER MIND THE REST O HIS OUTFIT IT WAS JIST WILD BUT IT WAS AWFUL FUNNY
3005-163390-0001 THE PEOPLE MOST KILLED THEMSELVES LAUGHING AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE CAPERING AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HAWED TILL HE COME BACK AND DONE IT OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM TO DO IT ANOTHER TIME

3005-163391-0018 BLAMED IF HE DIDN'T ENQUIRE ABOUT EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN THAT BLESSED TOWN AND ALL ABOUT THE WILKESES AND ABOUT PETER'S BUSINESS WHICH WAS A TANNER AND ABOUT GEORGE'S WHICH WAS A CARPENTER AND ABOUT HERVEY'S WHICH WAS A DISSENTERING MINISTER AND SO ON AND SO ON THEN HE SAYS

3005-163399-0000 PHELPS'S IS ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONE HORSE COTTON PLANTATIONS AN THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE
3005-163399-0001 I WENT AROUND AND CLIMBED OVER THE BACK STILE BY THE ASHHOPPER AND STARTED TO THE KITCHEN
3005-163399-0002 AYE OUT WITH A YES'M FORE I THOUGHT
3005-163399-0003 SO THEN SHE STARTED FOR THE HOUSE LEADING ME BY THE HAND AND THE CHILDREN TAGGING OFF
3005-163399-0004 WHEN WE GOT THERE SHE SET ME DOWN IN A SPLIT BOTTOMED CHAIR AND SET HERSELF DOWN ON A LITTLE LOW STOOL IN FRONT OF ME HOLDING BOTH MY HANDS AND SAYS I
3005-163399-0005 WELL IT'S LUCKY BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO GET HEART
3005-163399-0006 AND I THINK THAT HE DIED AFTERWARDS HE WAS A BAPTIST

3005-163399-0008 YOUR UNCLE'S BEEN UP TO THE TOWN EVERY DAY TO FETCH ME
3005-163399-0009 YOU MUST HAVE MET HIM ON THE ROAD DIDN'T YOU YOUNGISH MAN WITH A

3005-163399-0011 IT WAS KINDER THIN ICE WHEN I SAYS
3005-163399-0012 I HAD MY MIND ON THE CHILDREN AND ALL THE TIME I WANTED TO GET THEM OUT TO ONE SIDE AND PUMP THEM A LITTLE AND FIND OUT WHO I WAS
3005-163399-0013 PRETTY SOON SHE MADE THE COLD CHILLER STREAK ALL DOWN MY BACK BECAUSE SHE SAYS
3005-163399-0014 I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEAD I'D HAVE TO THROW UP MY HAND
3005-163399-0015 SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I GOT TO RASK THE TRUTH
3005-163399-0016 I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND BUSTLED ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE HE COMES
3005-163399-0017 CHILDREN DEAR DON'T YOU SAY A WORD
3005-163399-0018 I SEE I WAS IN A FIX SOMEHOW
3005-163399-0019 MISSUS PHELPS SHE JUMPS FOR HIM AND SAYS OH
3005-163399-0020 DOES HE COME NO SAYS HER HUSBAND
3005-163399-0021 I CAN'T IMAGINE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MAKES YOU DREADFUL UNEASY
3005-163399-0022 SO UNEASY SHE SAYS I'M READY TO GO DISTRACTED
3005-163399-0023 HE MUST A COME AN YOU'VE MISSED HIM ON DE ROAD
3005-163399-0024 OH DO DON'T DISTRESS ME ANY MORE'N I'M ALREADY DISTRESSED
3005-163399-0025 WHY SILAS LOOK YONDER UP THE ROAD AIN'T THAT SOMEBODY GOING
3005-163399-0026 THE OLD GENTLEMAN PAUSED AND SAYS
3005-163399-0027 I HAIN'T NO IDEA WHO IS I
3005-163399-0028 IS TOM SAWER
3005-163399-0029 BING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AN COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGHIN ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
3005-163399-0030 THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES DOWN BY THAT BOAT
3080-5032-0000 BUT I AM HUGELY PLEASED THAT I HAVE SEEN MY LADY
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN OF THE WORST OF HER
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUMOURS AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
3080-5032-0003 WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS ANDRE GARLAND
3080-5032-0004 WELL THE BEST ON IT IS THAT I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGEST
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITHAL AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID IN MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN HIS
3080-5032-0008 TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I IS VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS A SQUIRE OF DANE'S AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND TO SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT OF ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0010 I HOPE MY YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH HIM
3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUT THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO ME FOR THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT WE MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAVE HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER AT WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0014 BUT BESIDES I CAN'T GIVE YOU OTHERS
3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRETENDED AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0016 YOU'D THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY MAKE IT
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMORS EVERY BODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBOURS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS IT
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU YOU HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT OR THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED TO HER
3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE BUT AS MUCH MORE CALMLY
3080-5032-0024 AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO WELL OR HAVE I LEARNED IT SINCE
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM CHEEK DID COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETERS
3080-5032-0026 HOW KINDLY DO I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHER'S IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE WHY HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
3080-5040-0000 WHICH IT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DESERVE IT
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER AND VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMAGE
3080-5040-0003 A WONDER HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNOW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE IN BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC LODGING TO BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WHERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTERS TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW THEM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
3080-5040-0008 MY OWN AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGONE THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED

3080-5040-0010 ON THE NEXT I SHALL BE GONE INTO KENT AND MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR INTERCOURSE VERY MUCH

3080-5040-0012 I TOLD YOU IN MY LAST THAT MY SUFFOLK JOURNEY WAS LAID ASIDE AND THAT INTO KENT I HASTENED

3080-5040-0014 INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS COMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUDGE BY A MOST EXCELLENT SERVANT AND FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE
3080-5040-0015 BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT INTEND IT SO THOUGH I COULD ASSURE YOU
3080-5040-0016 I DO NOT FIND IT THO I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVED ME
3080-5040-0017 BUT IF I AM CALLED UPON
3080-5040-0018 DIRECTED FOR YE MASTER
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHID WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL THAT I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS THAN THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING THAT
3080-5040-0021 YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE AT THIS THAT I ESCAPE DROWNED
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WROTE BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CAN NOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0023 HOW WE WELCOME YOU WILL BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CAN NOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DELAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGHED TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT THE KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY YOUR PRAYERS WHEN WE HAVE TIME
3080-5040-0027 AH IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
3080-5040-0028 WILL YOU BE SO GOOD NATURED THERE
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS THE FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW THAT HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THUS WITH DISCOURSES OF THE PARTY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER OPINION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OF HER AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US BUT NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASE CART WITH NINE TEAS IN IT UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PADA INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
3331-159605-0001 THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MORE THE CREDIT
3331-159605-0002 I'VE TRIED IT AND GOT IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME WHEN I SAY YES
3331-159605-0004 WHAT A SPITEFUL THING I IS
3331-159605-0005 I DID DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 LET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN THAT
3331-159605-0007 HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIVES AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THE WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WORLD ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE OR GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THAT HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERYONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD BEEN CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLATTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK HOW SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
3331-159605-0014 PAUL FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE ALTOGETHER ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BECKIE AND BESS BUT COULD NOT RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FAN THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DOLL BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASSA CHARLIE'S HAND MISS MAMMY AN WALK PRETTY LIKE BILLIE AND FLOSSIE SAID THE MAID
3331-159605-0019 AT THE STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOLBOY WAS PARTING FROM THE ROSY FACED SCHOOLGIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOLED AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING VERY LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE RUSS ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT IF FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF THE HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0025 AND THANK YOU NO
3331-159605-0026 HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN BRIGHT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FLEW
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS ITS OWN
3331-159605-0029 SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BUOYANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU COULD ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A VILE LIKE LEVERLY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND AS SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVORITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WITH WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 WORKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS OF YOU
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS SHE'LL STEAL HIM
3331-159605-0035 ARE UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PODDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBER
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS NOT HE PREPARED
3331-159605-0038 AND DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO
3331-159605-0039 TRULY JULIE FANNE
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE SAID
3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AS I HAVE
3331-159605-0042 I JUST GAVE HER A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THEN DON'T THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT SIDDY TATTLERS SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHANDLAY MAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THINGS FOR YOU
3331-159605-0046 I AM ODD YOU KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSICAL ALL MY DAYS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY AND HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WHITEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MINDS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE MORROW DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL A VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL OR THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NO I'M ONLY TIRED HAD A GREAT DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I TRIED NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DO SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0008 NOW THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
3331-159609-0009 CRIED POLLY WITH THAT HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0010 AND POOR POLLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELL THAT FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE A SORT OF CHOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT SEEMED SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BEFORE
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER IN ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATED THEIR RESPECTIVE VERIEWS WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTMENTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID FANNY TURNING TO HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO JOHN JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCES HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINTER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH OUR GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT A CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OF THE BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORES
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MORE
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER SILENCE
3331-159609-0024 FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON ME ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORKBASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE OR TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
3528-168656-0000 SHE HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY AFTER THE REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO BEG IN THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR THAT SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSSEBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOLGIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL LOVERS FROWN
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A CENTURY AND SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE DUKE OF FONTREVAL DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0006 SHE WOULD NEVER SHOW THIS OBJECT TO ANY ONE
3528-168656-0007 NOW IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENT
3528-168656-0008 FOR SOME UNIQUE CHAPLET SOME AUTHENTIC RELIC
3528-168656-0009 THEY LOST THEMSELVES IN CONJECTURES HE
3528-168656-0010 AND WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT THE DANCER IS LAUGHING WITH A SATANNICAL AIR
3528-168656-0012 THE MORAL LOVE CONQUERED BY THE COLIC
3528-168669-0000 THE PRIORESS CAME AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HER CHAIR
3528-168669-0001 WE MAY PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0002 FATHER FARUENT
3528-168669-0003 BUT REVEREND MOTHER DO YOU KNOW THE CHAPEL
3528-168669-0004 AND YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIRE IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
3528-168669-0005 THERE IS A STONE TO BE RAISED THE HEAVY
3528-168669-0006 THE SLAP OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE FOOT OF THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0007 AT THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT YES
3528-168669-0008 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR EACH
3528-168669-0009 AND A WOMAN IS NEVER A MAN
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DAM BABYLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLONUS HORSES ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERONUS HORSES NEITHER DO I
3528-168669-0011 MERIT CONSISTS OF WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCK YARD
3528-168669-0012 AND A MAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0013 AND CAN YOU GET A LAVER
3528-168669-0014 THERE IS A ROOM IN THE STONE
3528-168669-0015 I MAY PUT THE LEVER THROUGH IT
3528-168669-0016 THAT IS GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I CAN OPEN THE VAULT
3528-168669-0017 WELL THAT BE ALL NO
3528-168669-0018 GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS VERY REVEREND MADAM
3528-168669-0019 FAUVANT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU

3528-168669-0028 AND THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN MY DIRECTION THAT MORNING
3528-168669-0029 IT WAS ANOTHER CRUCIFIX
3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER A
3528-168669-0031 THE MASTERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW
3528-168669-0032 A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM MORE OPEN
3528-168669-0033 HEYES MORE OFTEN

3528-168669-0037 BUT I DID NOT SAY MORE THAN

3528-168669-0046 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HERS SO SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0047 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT HEART
3528-168669-0048 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORISON WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING AND
3528-168669-0049 FAUCHELEVENTIN HELD HIS PEACE SHE WENT ON
3528-168669-0050 I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABOURING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR PAINFUL FRUIT
3528-168669-0051 FORTUNATELY THE PITESS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT

3528-168669-0069 SHE ASKED IT OF US THAT IS TO SAY HE COMMANDED US
3528-168669-0070 BUT IT IS FORBIDDEN HIM

3528-168669-0130 I WILL MAKE HIM MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES'
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT WHAT SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER IT WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTIONS AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 WHEN YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE PERFECTLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SUMMER TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THO THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0008 IN FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FIXED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN WITH AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PRACTICE OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN A STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOUR FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON TRIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTIES ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS OF SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THIRTY
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHILE THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN O EIGHT EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICET TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER AND THEY MIGHT NOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS I
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES FROM STEMS
3538-142836-0023 ISIS AND
3538-142836-0024 AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE FAIRLY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE SPATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COTTON KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROTECT INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIVES
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NEVER A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND MORE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME NOW SAID THE HEAD
3538-163619-0004 AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW HER HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM HIS KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHTS OF LAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER THEN SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS THY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THAT FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE SAID VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE OF SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND HAVE NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOGS OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GETTING A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SEND ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE COALS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WAITED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES SIR I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 WHO HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 AGAIN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTIFF AND HE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB THEIR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAGS
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASY THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SYD DEAR LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDER LADD SET OUT IN HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID SINDER LAD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID SINDER GLAD
3538-163622-0014 AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONGER WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING THEN
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID SINDERD
3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT DARK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SINDERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO MAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAD CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SAY ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE FOAL SEEST THOU NOTHING
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FOAR DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THATS A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDER SAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY HEARTS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE WHEN HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE SHOULD BE HEALED
3538-163624-0003 SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MOMENT AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO A RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT HARM HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM THEM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE WOLF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REGAN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED HIM WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO DEGAN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGURD SAID THAT GEORGE WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE THEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HER VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NOW DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LET HIS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FAFFNER AND THEN STEVENER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFNER'S HEART AND LET EM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNER ON A STEAK AND ROASTED HIM
3538-163624-0018 THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE CAN TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINHHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MIGHT SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF HIS SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR FATHER
3538-163624-0023 LYN BRANHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAMES IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUNDAN WERE BATHING BRUNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRON'S SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 AND HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG UNTIL I AM DEAD

367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION IN ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMARY OF INFORMATION TO THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FROM THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN

367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT ON THE PICKSKIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING HER WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED IT DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER
367-293981-0014 IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT RETURNED SANCHO WOE BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KINDRED WHY DID YOU LET HIM TASTE IT

367-293981-0018 THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLANKETED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW ADVENTURE WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS BOY WHO UTTERED THEM
367-293981-0019 YOU SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
367-293981-0020 SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK IT NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THE BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
3764-168670-0000 THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN WERE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
3764-168670-0001 COSETTE HE HAD WAKED UP
3764-168670-0002 JEAN VALJEAN HAD LEFT HER NEAR THE FIRE

3764-168670-0031 NO NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKERS MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COMES TO GET THE COFFIN

3764-168670-0039 YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP INTO THE COFFIN AT TWO O'CLOCK
3764-168670-0040 FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS FINGER JOINTS BUT THE IS IMPOSSIBLE
3764-168670-0041 BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS AN A PLANK
3764-168670-0042 JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS TO THIS
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONDUCT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
3764-168670-0044 WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A PURE
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALES
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK INTO LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0047 A MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE OR
3764-168670-0048 WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO A CAT DO COME AGAIN
3764-168670-0049 THE OVERBRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
3764-168670-0050 BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED IT
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU RE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
3764-168670-0052 AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES ON THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0053 AND I SHALL FOLLOW THAT IS MY BUSINESS
3764-168670-0054 THE HOUSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN NOT A ROPE ROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0055 THAT PRIEST SAYS THE PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN I WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER
3764-168670-0057 OH THAT IS SETTLED FATHER FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL GO WELL
3764-168671-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAINNE PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEARS
3764-168671-0001 THIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH ON WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
3764-168671-0002 A MORNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED HIM
3764-168671-0003 BEHIND IT WAS AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABORER WHO LIMPED ALONG
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING AND SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO THE SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE MOON DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES
3764-168671-0006 DAMPNESS WAS INVADING HIM THE FLOWERS WERE DESERTING IT
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VAUGIRARDS IT HINTED AT POVERTY PER LACHEISE IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHESE IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNISED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0009 THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN INTO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTARS OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENCE IN OUR SIGHT
3764-168671-0010 IT HAS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE A DUTY
3764-168671-0011 THE NUNS HAD COMMITTED THIS NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
3764-168671-0012 IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH A AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0013 MAKE AS MANY LINES AS YOU PLEASE MEN BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES
3764-168671-0014 A PRIEST IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPAL
3764-168671-0015 FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG AND BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0016 JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE PERFECT TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0017 WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE AS A MERE NOTHING
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESTHION
3764-168671-0019 HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HER DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
3764-168671-0020 THE PERMISSION FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHAUSTED
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LONG POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0022 THE MAN REPLIED THE GRAVE DIGGER AND
3764-168671-0023 THE GRAVE DIGGER AGAIN
3764-168671-0024 OF YOU I
3764-168671-0025 FATHER MESUENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
3764-168671-0026 FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS BUT A GRAVE DIGGER COULD STAY
3764-168671-0027 AND IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIGGERS DO DIE THEMSELVES
3764-168671-0028 HE HAD HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STAMMER THAT
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER BESTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER DUNNOIR IS HERE'S A JUG OF RED WINE
3764-168671-0031 BUT YOU'M A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
3764-168671-0032 ARE YOU NOT COMRADE WE'LL GO AND HAVE THE DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
3764-168671-0033 THE A MAN REPLIED
3764-168671-0034 HE LIMPED MORE OUT OF DIGNITY THAN FROM INFIRMITY
3764-168671-0035 THE GRAVE DIGGER WALKED ON IN FRONT OF EM
3764-168671-0036 FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED CREVLIERS ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A VALUABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER HE MUTTERED
3764-168671-0038 BUT SIR FATHER MASTIER IS DEAD
3764-168671-0039 THE MAN HAD REPLIED COMPLETELY
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTEBOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MESSIONNE'S TURN FATHER MESSIERNE DIED
3764-168671-0041 STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT IT IS MADE I
3764-168671-0042 AS YOU ARE A PEASANT I AM A PARISIAN
3764-168671-0043 FAUCHELEVENTT THOUGHT I AM LOST
3764-168671-0044 THERE WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE TRUN'S CORNER
3764-168671-0045 AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE AWAY
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THAT WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE CRETANNIUM TOWN HALL
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHORS BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0049 FOR YOU ARE NOT A GRAVE DIGGER THEN
3764-168671-0050 RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT THIS THE BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS
3764-168671-0051 NOT HERE A REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY
3764-168671-0052 FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH UTTERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053 THE GRAVEDIGGER WENT ON WITH A MYSTERIOUS SMILE
3764-168671-0054 ONE SHALL EAT
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM SLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT AS IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT
3997-180294-0002 WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED ME
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR THAT WRETCH
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO
3997-180294-0005 NOW GO AND I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD LONG ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS AND THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNCIL OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO GOD FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY PUT IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VEIL
3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THAT FEELINGS
3997-180294-0011 THEY LOVE BY PROFESSIONS AND NOT BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE AND WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0013 THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF I GIVE
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABOURERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED AND HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0015 THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVE THE SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVE THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LILAISSON
3997-180294-0018 WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAIEITY
3997-180294-0019 THE WOMAN BECOMES THE MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES YOU
3997-180294-0020 HOW WHY OH
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING IS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY HORSES TO NIGHT AT THE VAUDEVILLE
3997-180294-0023 COME DURING THE THIRD ENGRACT
3997-180294-0024 THE BOXES WERE FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY THE STAGE BLOCK
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR IN THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0027 DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOVED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING THEM ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 YOU SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE BUT WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0030 WHERE AT WHOM
3997-180294-0031 YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK THAT
3997-180294-0032 BECAUSE YOU I DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
3997-180294-0033 NONE THE LESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE KING AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0000 I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS YET
3997-180297-0001 YOU'RE IN THE WAY MAGGIE BUT HOW
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR YOU TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE
3997-180297-0003 DURING THIS REMARK BARBARA LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY
3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU WILL NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME BUT SAYING NO
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
3997-180297-0007 IS HE REALLY THE ONLY REASON
3997-180297-0008 IF THERE WERE ANY MORE I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
3997-180297-0009 HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL TOO
3997-180297-0010 I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS I WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0011 WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO DISCOVER
3997-180297-0012 I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITHOUT ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED THE LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DEVICE AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING A CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 THAT WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017 WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEM LAST THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER DO THEY GIVE YOU A ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THEATER
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKES BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0021 I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH I OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVED AND SAID WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH THIS LAST CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0024 MADAME DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
3997-180297-0025 MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID THAT
3997-180297-0026 HERE IT IS AS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK
3997-180297-0027 I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT SHOWED IT TO ME

4198-12281-0005 LORD GOD DARN ME HE POTUM
4198-12281-0006 LET HIM BE CARRIED TO PRISON FOR TROUBLING THE DIVINE SPIRITS
4198-12281-0007 WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN HER ADVENT AND ALL THE WINTER

4198-12281-0010 TO SOME WITH THEIR SMART SOUS ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDRIFTS WAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOME PUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THE PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
4198-12281-0011 MAYBE THAT IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER ONE SAW
4198-12281-0012 OH THE HOLY LADY NITTIS SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTUS O OUR LADY OF SUCCOURS SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP
4198-12281-0013 SOME DIED WITHOUT SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE WITHOUT DYING SOME DIED IN PASSING OTHERS SPOKE IN DYING
4198-12281-0014 CAN YOU TELL WITH WHAT INSTRUMENTS THEY GET IT
4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEAN TIME FRIAR JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT INTO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMY HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHER BY THE ADHERENCES OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS YEAR THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SHRDURAS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
4198-61336-0003 TIGLATH PALLISER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE EURENTIAN ARMY IN CUMUCH
4198-61336-0004 A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF ITS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SIGNAL COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING CORDORUS WHO LEAPED FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST YUURTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0007 THE SIFTI MATTI ILU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT CHARDORUS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TIGLATH A BELEEZER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTLAND WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0010 ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATITE ILIU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE LEADERS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA
4198-61336-0012 ITS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS IN THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 JEHOOASH THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARDS HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHELM
4198-61336-0015 THIS USURPER HELD SWAY AT SUMERIA FOR ONLY A TIME
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MEEHEIM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0017 TEGLATH PALIZER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTH EAST
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOT PUT TO THE SWARD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCKS HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS YURITU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLATH PILLIEZER RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0021 MAUHEIM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PEGAHIAH
4198-61336-0022 JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF HER DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT ITS INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0023 HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR ITS IDOLATRIES AND HE CRIED
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THAT HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YE ME AND YE SHALL LIVE HAVE YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL
4198-61336-0025 OF THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES SHALL PERISH
4198-61336-0026 TO ISRAEL WAS ALSO DEALT WITH
4198-61336-0027 HE SPOKE THROUGH ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0028 THE PHILISTINES AND THE ARABIANS OF THE DESERT WERE ALSO SURROUNDED
4198-61336-0029 WHY HE INVADED BABYLONIA
4198-61336-0030 UGENZER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITOL SANIPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0000 AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE THE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THAT WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO MY ERROR
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME THE LEAD TO GO
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BENNELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE REMAINS FOR IF HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0005 I ASK NO FURTHER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GREATEST FAVOR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLKS I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FAVOUR TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE HAND AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0008 I LIKED HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM I HAD EVER TAKEN IN
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GIORGIO DE CORTONA FIFTEEN YEARS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0010 GEORGIO CAME TO THEM HIS HEALTH
4294-14317-0011 I WILL HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUC ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LADI WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGELLOR
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTIONS OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTOR'S CRAFT
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON A PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-14317-0016 AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME MY NEW SCULPTOR
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA AND HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN HEART I REACHED OUR HOME
4294-32859-0000 WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY ON
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMPASSIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDOLINE AND RHETCH'S PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS UNPLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VESSELS
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE HOUSE WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MIGHT UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU AS A SWORD HE QUOTH
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN'S SIZE AND COURAGE AND SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON THIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRIED HAS BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HAD HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST REND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREEST
4294-35475-0008 IT IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HADTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US FROM THE OGRE'S KNIFE
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS GREAT AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET MIGHT CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A VISITOR IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS TERM
4294-35475-0015 THAT FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYHOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY AS TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS OVER A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE WAS CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY HAS SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR MAIDEN
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED SHOULD WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR THE HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE ORGRE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THESE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT ETHELRIE HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE ISOFF
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVERS OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
4294-9934-0001 YOU HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT ACT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND IN ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BATLIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE ONE
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF ART PAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESRANGE HIM FROM A FATHER
4294-9934-0008 BUT HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY AS SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARRIS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAC OH

4294-9934-0016 FOR THAT WILL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU BE AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU KNOW GERMAN IN NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT HE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHS DEALER WAS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS WE WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S
4294-9934-0022 HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY THREE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HELLO I HAD FORGOTTEN YOU SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT AND
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARTIUS
4294-9934-0026 THIS WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND A SIXTY PISTOLE THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK HIS THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 OF THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 THEY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS SPURS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST NATURE
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATES SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERY THING
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL GOD
4350-10919-0005 AS YE PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE FAMILY DOCTORS RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND SO THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROTEST WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
4350-10919-0009 YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDING THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKI BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HIM ON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED AH THERE IS
4350-10919-0012 OH WELL THEN HE CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW ABOUT THIS TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED IT IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH FOR LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0015 THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND THEN RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCE
4350-10919-0017 AND YET THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO IF ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 NOW TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HER DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS TO COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTORS WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTOR COMES IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ANSWERED HIM IT AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT TO THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS IS THE THREE TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE AND
4350-10919-0028 A NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 BUT THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY TROUBLE
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS OR TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD CALLED
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE CAME BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KATY PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED MEN OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-9170-0001 ALL THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF BALANCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DECISIONS
4350-9170-0005 THE BASIS OF HIS AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINING TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO HER SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008 HIS ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROLLED THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT MAY NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS CAN THE SOCIAL ORGANISATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND UPON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE COULD NOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEM STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THAT STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS REDUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY A STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES IT
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN CONTRARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENTS INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF HE DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FARTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLD EGGS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED FOR CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 SO I HAS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTES THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WOULD SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS UPON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND DUTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICES TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ABNORMICAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOILS OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOURING BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE PARTY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE FAMILY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS ARE OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AS BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MEDICAL SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND A TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL OF THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ENEMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE'S SOCIAL LIFE VAGUE AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE MADE ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST HIS CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AN FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY OR HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE DISPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENTS AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER ON
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE WOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED BUT SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND RELIGIOUS OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED TO THEIR NEIGHBOURS
4350-9170-0054 THAT GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSES
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NOBLES EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THAT MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND COMFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 AND SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOREST WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAY YOU KNOW IT
4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CARJACK AND A SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 OH WHO NEEDS A JOB BAN THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS
4852-28311-0003 OR K HE SAID
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM ON YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN EMER STREET
4852-28311-0006 WELL HE REPEATED I DID
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY A HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 I THINK IT REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED IN INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY INFLUENCED
4852-28311-0011 BITCH YE AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED TO HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE GARDEN
4852-28311-0013 AU SHUCKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOUT MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT IT IN TWO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK AT THE BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON TO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND THE WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND BIG CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THEIR JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ONCE CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTRE THE MODELS OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAMES STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIST SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER WECKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER STEAL
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARBHORN WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISSUS WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOME ONE COULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE NARROWING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0003 HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CLOSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0004 MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARDS THE SOURCES OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLES OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNERS TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S HANDS
4852-28312-0007 CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES WE WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0008 CHRIS SWALLOWED WHEN HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
4852-28312-0009 YEA SIR HE SAID
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO WANTS THE JOB
4852-28312-0011 HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE THAT
4852-28312-0012 SHAKIE HARRIS'S NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE BACE WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOUR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT EYES
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOF BEYOND
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE AGAIN'S GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEAD LIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALTUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE THAPHIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018 THE ROOM HAD SEEMED OVERLY STILL
4852-28312-0019 YET IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28312-0020 THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT LIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHERE IN THE FREEWAY
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF THE FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023 THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE AND
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW AT EVERY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLIT DISTANCE
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD BUT A HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
4852-28312-0027 THE COURTYARD WAS SCARCELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING THE SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS GRANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0029 A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THIS FLANGED COURTYARD
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OUT TO THE STABLE
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS A PART FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28319-0000 THE LEARNING OF HIS MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
4852-28319-0001 HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOISTER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28319-0002 CHRIS NEVER THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM THE BOWL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHOULD IT ALLY DO FIRST
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW A TIME FOR YOU TO TRY THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSE I CHANGE THAT CAN'T CHANGE BACK
4852-28319-0007 MISTER WORKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR PSMITH TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0008 THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WEGGER SAID START AT ONCE
4852-28319-0009 THE SENSATION SPREAD SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL YEARS
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT RATHER BY
4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR WHICH ONE THE RETURN
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE BUT CURVED UP POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0014 THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA OCCURRED TO CHRIS
4852-28319-0015 IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS WIFE COME TO LIFE
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THIS BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0017 BUT HOW DID ONE AGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
4852-28319-0018 CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKLER'S DOOR
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY IT RESUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE THEY INCREASED IN STORM
4852-28319-0021 DUST CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLS OF THE SKY
4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED FOR THE PROPER TIME
4852-28319-0023 MISTER WALKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UP STAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKY AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCION FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD HE REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
4852-28319-0025 IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED HER
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES THAT WIDEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED TO THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED LET THE BOUQUET FALL
4852-28330-0000 THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FULL
4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE NECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ALBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON BOARD
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
4852-28330-0004 THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHHITI
4852-28330-0005 WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE OF THERE
4852-28330-0006 CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED AT HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0007 CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING ARE
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINNELER WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE ROSE IN NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING HIM
4852-28330-0011 BUT HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO
4852-28330-0012 THE SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR A FAMILY
4852-28330-0013 HE PAUSED FINGERING THE LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM
4852-28330-0014 WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY I HAVE
4852-28330-0015 THIS SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN THEIR HANDS
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY NOW SIR
4852-28330-0017 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND BROWN PINK FACE CREASED IN ITS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0018 IT THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0019 CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET IT UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0020 WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRISS OUGHT TO ASK
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAD TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT
4852-28330-0022 I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN AND SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER BUCKER AND CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTIONILY ACCOUNTED
4852-28330-0025 THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN IN SOME LITTLE WHILE
533-1066-0000 WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAUN
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER FOR FOOD
533-1066-0002 I'M SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THIS EXCITEMENT
533-1066-0003 FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HELL IN THE LODGE
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SOCIAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0005 MISTER INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UPSTAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TO NIGHT
533-1066-0006 I CAN HAVE NONE I SAID HAPPILY
533-1066-0007 I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH NOTHING RATHER UNUSUAL
533-1066-0008 THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WILL BE A PEACEABLE NIGHT
533-1066-0009 SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID
533-1066-0010 PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT NOTHING
533-1066-0011 LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED OVER MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
533-1066-0012 THEY WERE TALKING COFILENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
533-1066-0013 THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE DRAWN OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0014 I ASK'D NO QUESTIONS
533-1066-0015 ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BURST OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STUART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE
533-1066-0016 I CAN HARDLY KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED
533-1066-0017 THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHERE WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT
533-1066-0018 I CONFESSE THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A CHEERFUL SPOT
533-1066-0019 IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH AS SHARPLY
533-1066-0020 IT WAS ALEX ARMOURED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES
533-1066-0021 THE DOCTOR KEPT A KEEN LOOKOUT BUT NO MAN APPEARED
533-1066-0022 THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITIES
533-1066-0023 A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT TRIGGING THEM UP
533-1066-0024 I KEPT ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN
533-131556-0000 BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY CAN
533-131556-0001 FOR NONE COULD ENDURE ME AS SHE HAS DONE OH
533-131556-0002 THE WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A UGLY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GREAT FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
533-131556-0004 I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD THEM SO INTIMATELY
533-131556-0005 THEY HAD BEATEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH THE BOOK
533-131556-0006 I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE INFLUENCE OF IT
533-131556-0007 UPON PERUSING THIS SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT MY LIP
533-131556-0008 YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND SHE'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT
533-131556-0009 WILL WILL YOU OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE
533-131556-0010 HUH YOU'RE SUSPICIOUS
533-131556-0011 IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE
533-131556-0012 I ENJOY A MOONLAND RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES ON HER AND THE THRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RESORTS
533-131556-0013 SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER NOSE AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
533-131556-0014 I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THAT DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
533-131556-0015 YES YOU YES
533-131556-0016 SUPPOSE I BE
533-131556-0017 SHE PAUSED IN AN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW
533-131556-0018 I NEVER RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
533-131556-0019 IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL BROTHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR ADEPTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
533-131556-0020 I SHALL NOT CALL HIM
533-131556-0021 YOU GIVE ME NO THANKS IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I REFRAIN
533-131556-0022 AND MILICENT WILL YOU LOVE HER
533-131556-0023 I WOULD NOT FOR MUCH THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF MY RELATION
533-131556-0024 YOU USED OUR WORDS MISSUS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU
533-131556-0025 HOW DARE YOU MENTION ANY NAME TO ME
533-131562-0000 IT SEEMS VERY INTERESTING LOVE SAID HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO WHERE I STOOD WRINGING MY HANDS IN SILENT RAGE AND ANGUISH BUT IT'S RATHER LONG I'LL LOOK AT IT SOME OTHER TIME AND ANYHOW I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KISS MY DEAR WHAT KISS
533-131562-0001 THE KEYS OF YOUR CABINET DESK'S DRAWER AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
533-131562-0002 THE KEY OF MY VESTURE IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
533-131562-0003 NOW THEN SNEERS HE WE MUST HAVE A CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY
533-131562-0004 AND PUTTING THE KEYS INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED TOWARD THE LIBRARY
533-131562-0005 THAT AND ALL REPLIED THE MATTER AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
533-131562-0006 MISTER HUNTINGDON THEN WENT OFF STAIRS
533-131562-0007 MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE IS A VERY DEVIL FOR A SPITE
533-131562-0008 I DIDN'T SAY I'D BROKEN IN IT DID I RETURNED HE
533-131562-0009 I SHALL PUT YOU UP AS A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE FOR YOUR OWN PRIVATE EXPENSES AND YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ANY MORE ABOUT MY CONCERNS I SHALL LOOK OUT FOR A STEWARD MY DEAR I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO THE TEMPTATION
533-131562-0010 AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREEBS MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS THEY MUST GO UP ON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN
533-131562-0011 WHAT GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE YOU MADE NOW MISTER HUNTINGDON
533-131562-0012 I ATTENDED TO DEFRAUD YOU
533-131562-0013 AND NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS BUT IT'S BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
533-131562-0014 HERE BENSON ENTERED THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENTLY TRIUMPHING IN MY DESPAIRS
533-131562-0015 I KNOW THAT DAY AFTER DAY SUCH FEELINGS WILL REMAIN UPON ME
533-131562-0016 I HAVE TRIED TO LOOK TO HIM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT IT WILL CLEAVE TO THE DUST
533-131564-0000 VAIN HOPE OR FEAR
533-131564-0001 MISTER AND MISSUS HATTERSLEY HAVE BEEN STAYING IN THE GROVE A FORTNIGHT AND AS MISSUS HARGRAVE IS STILL ABSENT AND THE WEATHER WAS REMARKABLY FINE I NEVER PASSED A DAY WITHOUT SEEING MY TWO FRIENDS MILICENT AND ESTHER EITHER THERE OR HERE
533-131564-0002 NO SINCE YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT HIM HOME
533-131564-0003 NO I CAN'T YOU DON'T WANT HIM DO YOU
533-131564-0004 IT IS A RESOLUTION WHO HAD FORMED LONG AGO
533-131564-0005 WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS THOUGH YOU CAN'T RESPECT HIM
533-131564-0006 NO I'LL RATHER BE LIKE MYSELF THAN AS I AM

533-131564-0017 I SOUGHT OUT AND PUT INTO HIS HANDS TWO OF THE MILICENT'S LETTERS ONE DATED FROM LONDON AND WRITTEN DURING ONE OF HIS WILDEST SEASONS OF RECKLESS DISSIPATION THE OTHER IN THE COUNTRY DURING A LUCID INTERVAL
533-131564-0018 THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANION ABUSING MISTER GRIMSBY AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENIOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON THE OTHER MAN'S SHOULDERS
533-131564-0019 I'VE BEEN A CURSED RASCAL GOD KNOWS SAID HE AS HE GAVE IT AN EARTHY SQUEEZE BUT YOU SEE IF I DON'T MAKE AMENDS FOR IT DAMN YOU IF I DON'T

533-131564-0027 AFTER WHICH THEY WILL REPAIR TO THEIR COUNTRY HOME
5442-32873-0000 CAPTAIN LAKE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE A LONDON PANDIE NOW
5442-32873-0001 THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND A WILD LURE IN HER YELLOW EYES RACHAEL SAT DOWN
5442-32873-0002 A SLAVE ONLY THINK AN SLAVE
5442-32873-0003 NO FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL IS IT A DREAM
5442-32873-0004 OH FRIGHTFUL TROUBLE
5442-32873-0005 STANLEY STANLEY IT WILL BE MERCY TO KILL ME SHE BROKE HER AGAIN
5442-32873-0006 BRIGHT AND GNATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH A BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF A SAGE HER PILLOW SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGINGS OF LACE
5442-32873-0007 WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TORLOT BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH A LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
5442-32873-0008 THERE WAS NOTHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE ADDRESS
5442-32873-0009 THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GOING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM
5442-32873-0010 WHEN SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS
5442-32873-0011 RACHAEL LEEAK RACHEL LAKE WHAT ARE YOU NOW
5442-32873-0012 I'LL STAY HERE THAT IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND MY FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-32873-0013 HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGONT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0014 LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKIN'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WILDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOLL CART FOR MIKE BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOCHART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
5442-32873-0015 BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LINE WHICH HAS ITS GABLE ACROSS THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGDEN
5442-32873-0016 HERE WERE THE FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER TO THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELLED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
5442-32873-0017 LOSE NO TIME AS I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A CRUMB
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STUCK HOME ON HIS GREASY WIDE AWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOLL CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TAMAR SAID
5442-41168-0000 THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALL
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT UP TO THIS TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THAT VERY COARSE SERGY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR OTTO A BAYOT
5442-41168-0004 WILL SHED OUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE IS NOT A CASHIER THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 VOTES PLEASE BIEE
5442-41168-0007 THEY FIXED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOUT FLERMOFF SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATIONS TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE INNOCENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT BARS
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GREYWHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED A SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JURING AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN ASKED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0014 SERGEY IVANOVITCH GROANED
5442-41168-0015 THAT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN DECISION SHE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACK GROUND
5442-41168-0017 A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETEEN EIGHT AGAINST
5442-41168-0018 SANG BY THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
5442-41168-0019 THEN THERE WAS THE LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO KNOTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX
5442-41168-0020 THEN THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERED
5442-41168-0021 IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHOWN TO HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL THIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SELL
5442-41168-0024 AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH ANOTHER SIDE DOOR
5442-41168-0025 THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY AT THE ELECTION
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNETKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF THIS UNIFORM
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT FLORAOV TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMEN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VROSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID ABOVE HIM
5442-41169-0002 HE'S SUCH A DARKGUARD
5442-41169-0003 I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF YOU
5442-41169-0004 THESE PERSONS WORE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY IN FINE CHAMPAGNE
5442-41169-0006 LAST YEAR AT OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL MIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S
5442-41169-0007 OH STILL JUST THE SAME ONLY AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
5442-41169-0008 WHY OF WHAT IS THERE TO UNDERSTAND
5442-41169-0009 THERE IS NO MEETING IN IT AT ALL
5442-41169-0010 THEN TOO ONE MUST KEEP UP ATTENTIONS
5442-41169-0011 IT'S A GREAT OBLIGATION OF A SORT
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE'S A ONE'S OWN INTERESTS
5442-41169-0013 THEY ARE PROPRIETORS OF HIS SOD BUT WE ARE THE LAND OWNERS
5442-41169-0014 THAT IT CAN BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THAT VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREES
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND HOW IS YOUR HEAD DOING
5442-41169-0017 BUT ONE'S WORK IS THROWN IN OR NOTHING
5442-41169-0018 OH WELL ONE DOES IT WOULD YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0019 AN WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET THAT DOES IT
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN MASLIEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY OWN THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THAT LIME TREE
5442-41169-0023 HERE YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF PACH
5442-41169-0024 YOU'RE MARRIED I HEARD YOU SAID THE LANDOWNER
5442-41169-0025 YES IT'S RATHER SERIOUS HE WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THE LAND OWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MOUSTACHE
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR POGS FOR TABLE
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNING AT A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL OF THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A RETURN TOO OF A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HERRMANN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANER
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD HELP HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS REPUTATION
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF A ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL OF HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUED DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTLIUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT TO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT DID NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SERVED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMANN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF A GRAMMATIUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENOO
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE EMPLOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELT CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOUSE
5484-24317-0014 CRETES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICHO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENAU'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSIDMACHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HARMON INCREDULOUSLY OH
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES AND TIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISED ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THE WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMYNTAS THE LIEGE CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLIS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE SUN PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSTAULT IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING HIS WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON US HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMAND
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENOUR HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED MY STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HERMAND LISTENED TO THE FAIR IN SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENUL ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRETEZ HERMANN'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMEANOUR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT US
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DOES NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMANN'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WAS JUST A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THROUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNAZE ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT A VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVING
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMANN PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS BEHIND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LED TO THAT EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO ITS ART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN END AS A BOOM FROM THE ELEMENTS
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT SPARE HER A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DARED NO BETTER FATE
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAS PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMANN WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AN ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTERS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24318-0010 YET IT WAS SOME ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT HAD ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNNATURAL MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPAUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERRIMAND IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED A SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PACK
5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE VISITORS BUT PHILIPPA SILENCED HER WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HIM TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DARK MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PILASTRE THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ONCE
5484-24318-0021 DAPHNE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MOST IS NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMANN WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TOMORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORKER MYRTELIUS
5484-24318-0024 WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU AND
5484-24318-0025 AND I FOOL BLINDED ALSO IN MIND I COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRINGS THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL AND PALLIATE NOTHING
5484-24318-0027 SOACKAIUS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF ON HER WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMINETUZ THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST THING
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROPPPED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HERSELF WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO HAVE TRUTH ITS JUST DUE
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SANDS AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERMANN
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATULUS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HERREMON
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS CHARACTER
5484-24318-0037 HONOUR TO MYRTELIS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FEASTAL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMPS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THESE GOD GAVE RAIN THUNDER AND HARVEST
5764-299665-0001 OH WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND MYSELF
5764-299665-0002 WHETHER ANY PRAYER WAS EVER ANSWERED HE
5764-299665-0003 WHY DID HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUAL ENTHUSIASM
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE ORIGINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0005 ARE A FAILURES UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0006 IS WE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH A LASH OR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOWED FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0008 IS THEIR GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0009 DID THIS GOD A BLOW THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0010 DID HE ALLOW TYRANTS TO SHED A BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0011 CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS PRINCE
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DIVORRE HUMAN BEINGS FOR THEIR FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A THE WORLD WHERE LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTUALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC EARTH THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
5764-299665-0015 FEAR BUILDS THIS ALTAR AND OFFERS THE SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0016 FEAR CORRECTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0017 LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0018 CAN WE SAY THAT HE CARED OF THE CHILDREN OF MEN
5764-299665-0019 SHALL WE SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDURED FOREVER
5764-299665-0020 DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOSES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0021 IT WAS THERE GOODNESS WAS THERE WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0022 A OUGHT THE SUPERIOR RACE TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THE INFERIOR
5764-299665-0023 MOST PEOPLE CLING TO THE SUPERNATURAL AND
5764-299665-0024 IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE NOTHING
5764-299665-0025 WHAT IS THESE POWER
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES NO EXPERIENCE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COME IN WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0028 HE HAS MADE THAT ROAD AND KNOWS THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPED IT WITH ITS DIMPLED HANDS
5764-299665-0030 THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAD TAUGHT THE CHILD A LEGEND
5764-299665-0031 IT IS A REAL
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THE CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0033 WE LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS I
5764-299665-0034 THEY ARE PRAISED ADMIRED AND REPORTED
5764-299665-0035 THEY ARE REGARDED AS MUCH THAT IS TO SAY AS MORAL
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MEASURES
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAD SAID CONSCIENCE IS BOUND OF LOVE
5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE OBSERVED
5764-299665-0039 THE IMAGINATION IS CULTIVATED I
5764-299665-0040 NOT A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF ANOTHER
5764-299665-0041 THE SENSE OF DIGNITY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
5764-299665-0042 CAN JUDGES HIMSELF
5764-299665-0043 IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOT NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0044 MAN HAS NOT DECEIVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HES CHRISTIANITY DAN GOND
5764-299665-0046 WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL HAD MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY IN AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN WORTH WITHOUT REASON
5764-299665-0049 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION AND CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0050 WHAT DID CHRISTIAN CHRISTIANITY DO FOR THEM
5764-299665-0051 THEY HATED HIS PLEASURE
5764-299665-0052 THEY MUFFLED ALL THE BELLS OF GLADUS
5764-299665-0053 THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED MERCY
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HAVE HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A FAITH IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN'
5764-299665-0057 IN ALL OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT
5764-299665-0058 HAS THE BIBLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KINDER AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES I HAVE FAILED
5764-299665-0060 THE RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
5764-299665-0061 RELIGION HAS NEITHER MADE MEN FREE
5764-299665-0062 IT HAD NEVER MADE A MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
5764-299665-0063 ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARER HONEST THEN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0064 CAN WE CURE ANY DISEASE BY SUPPLICATION
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUES OR HONOUR AS ALMS
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT ITS MASTER PUNISHES AND REPORTS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE COME THE STONES
5764-299665-0068 THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A BASEMENT IN
5764-299665-0069 IF WE BEHOLD WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM
5764-299665-0070 I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER STAIRS
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST STONE IS THAT THE MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNERSTONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM END TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEVER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE REPEATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0075 I SAY ALL I THINK
5764-299665-0076 EVERY E EVENT HAS PARENTS
5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED COULD NEVER
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INDEFINITE CHAIN THERE IS AND THE CAMP BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
5764-299665-0079 WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT THE FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0080 WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS WONDERFUL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE ROCKS THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELLED
5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE FOOT STEPS OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE THE REFORMERS FORCED
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND ON THE WORD ON LUCK AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VOTES TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0087 THE FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE WHY
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PRODUCED WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND PROCEEDS WITHOUT THOUGHT
5764-299665-0089 MUST THE WORLD FOREVER REMAIN THE VICTIM OF INNOCENT PASSION
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE A BURTHEN AND CURSES
5764-299665-0091 PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEAF TO
5764-299665-0092 LAW CAN NOT PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
5764-299665-0093 THIS WILL NOT BE DONE BY TALK OR EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0094 AND THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0095 THIS FREES MEN
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME WILL ALL BE CHILDLESS
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE PORTS AND BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE
6070-63485-0000 THERE DONE SO SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOW KEY TO THE CHOUETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE
6070-63485-0001 THE TWO MONSTERS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE WOODS
6070-63485-0002 BY MEANS OF THIS STRATAGEM THEY FOLLOWED SO CLOSELY THAT ALTHOUGH WITHIN A FEW STEPS OF CAESAR AND TOM THEY DID NOT HEAR THEM
6070-63485-0003 SARAH AND HER BROTHER HAVING AGAIN PASSED BY THE TUPPY FRANC ARRIVED CLOSE TO THE DILAPIDATED HOUSE WHICH WAS PARTLY IN RUINS AND ITS OPEN CELLARS FORMED A KIND OF GULF DOWN WHICH THE STREET RAN IN THAT DIRECTION
6070-63485-0004 IN AN INSTANT THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH A LEAP RESEMBLING IN STRENGTH AND AGILITY THE SPRING OF A TIGER SEIZED SATAN WITH ONE HAND BY THE THROAT AND EXCLAIMED YOUR MONEY OR I WILL FLING YOU INTO A HOLE
6070-63485-0005 NO SAID THE OLD BRUTE GRUMBLINGLY NO NOT ONE RING OF WHAT A SHAME
6070-63485-0006 TOM SEYTON DID NOT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND DURING THIS SCENE SO RAPIDLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AS IT HAD OCCURRED
6070-63485-0007 O AH TO LAY A TRAP TO CATCH US SAID THE THIEF
6070-63485-0008 THEN ADDRESSING THOMAS SEYTON YOU KNOW THE PANE OF SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0009 DID YOU SEE IN THE CABARET WE HAVE JUST LEFT AND I KNOW YOU AGAIN THE MAN WHOM THE CHARCOAL MAN CAME TO SEEK
6070-63485-0010 CRIED THE SCHOOLMASTER A THOUSAND FRANCS AND I'LL KILL YOU
6070-63485-0011 WRETCH I DO NOT LIKE HIS LIFE REPLIED SARAH TO THE SCHOOLMASTER
6070-63485-0012 LET'S GO AND BRING HIM
6070-63485-0013 ALL BY IT'LL BE FOR LOOKING AFTER
6070-63485-0014 WELL MY WIFE SHALL BE THERE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER YOU WILL TELL HER WHAT YOU MEAN AND I SHALL SEE

6070-86744-0001 MY VERY GOOD FRIEND AN EXCELLENT MAJOR REPLIED THE COUNT WITH A SMILE YOU REALLY EXAGGERATE MY TRIFLING EXERTIONS
6070-86744-0002 MY FATHER THE COMTE DE MORCERF ALTHOUGH OF SPANISH ORIGIN POSSESSES CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE BOTH AT THE COURT OF FRANCE AND MADRID AND I UNHESITATINGLY PLACE THE BEST SERVICES OF MYSELF AND ALL TO WHOM MY NAME IS DEAR AT YOUR DISPOSAL

6070-86744-0009 THAT DEPENDS WHEN DO YOU WISH
6070-86744-0010 FOR FRANCE NONE FOR VENICE I SHALL REMAIN IN ITALY FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO
6070-86744-0011 THUS WE SHALL NOT MEET IN PARIS
6070-86744-0012 I FEAR I SHALL NOT HAVE THAT PLEASURE
6070-86744-0013 WILL SINCE WE MUST PART SAID THE COUNT HOLDING OUT A HAND TO EACH OF THE YOUNG MEN ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU BOTH A SAFE AND PLEASANT JOURNEY
6070-86744-0014 WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED ALBERT OF FRANCE WHEN THEY HAD RETURNED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS YOU SEEM MORE THAN COMMONLY THOUGHTIVE
6070-86744-0015 I WILL CONFESS TO YOU ALBERT REPLIED FRANZ THE COUNT WAS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0016 DID YOU EVER MEET HIM PREVIOUSLY TO COMING HITHER AND
6070-86744-0017 UPON MY HONOUR THEN LISTEN TO YOU
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY IN THE ALMOST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAM AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YACHT SEEN IN THAT DISTANT HORIZON DRIVING UNDER FULL SAIL TOWARD PORTO VECCHIO
6070-86744-0019 THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PIPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86744-0020 BUT SAID FRANTZ THE CORSICAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSELS
6070-86744-0021 WHY A REALLY THE THING SEEMS TO ME SIMPLE ENOUGH
6070-86744-0022 TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DOES HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT WERE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELLOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINGTURED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO BLACK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY
6070-86744-0023 CERTAINLY THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO ANSWER
6070-86744-0024 MY DEAR FRANTZ REPLIED ALBERT WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO DELIVER YOU
6070-86744-0025 WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT IS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY ARE HE A NATIVE
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESS HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SENOR VAMPA WHO I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASE AND UNCONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ELEMENTS WERE ALL ON ALBERT'S SIDE
6070-86744-0028 WELL SAID FRANZ WITH A LAUGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT FOR YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND MY POWERS OF REFUTATION
6070-86744-0029 AND NOW MY DEAR FRANZ LET ME TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
6070-86745-0000 THEN SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS THAT PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND COURT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS FROM WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0002 AT A QUARTER TO TEN A VALET ENTERED HE COMPOSED WITH A LITTLE GROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH AT ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASSEUR ALSO
6070-86745-0003 WAIT THEN DURING THE DAY TELL ROSAS THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISHED
6070-86745-0004 A VERY WELL AT HALF PAST TEN
6070-86745-0005 IS THE COUNTESS UP HERE
6070-86745-0006 THE VALET LEFT THE ROOM I
6070-86745-0007 GOOD MORNING LUCIEN GOOD MORNING SAID ALBERT YOUR PUNCTUALITY REALLY ALARMS HIM
6070-86745-0008 YOU WHOM I EXPECTED LASTLY YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIXED WAS HALF PAST
6070-86745-0009 NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW DO NOT CONFOUND THY PLANS
6070-86745-0010 AH YES HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGES IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTH
6070-86745-0011 IT IS FOR THAT REASON YOU SEE ME SO UTTERLY
6070-86745-0012 I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I HAD GOT UP TO HAVE A RIDE FOR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 PEESTS I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT YOU WOULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE
6070-86745-0014 BESIDES THAT DOES NOT CONCERN THE ROOM BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
6070-86745-0015 ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE HORSES
6070-86745-0016 IN THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THEIR LEADERS
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RAIN YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE
6070-86745-0018 COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIN
6070-86745-0019 WITH MY TALENTS YOU WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN HIS PAGES
6128-63240-0001 THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOMETHING FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
6128-63240-0002 OH SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I'M THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORKADAY ASPECT
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF THE LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THEIR DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVELS OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY IN THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING WHICH SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD
6128-63240-0009 AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND A IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPPES AND ROARING RADICALS
6128-63240-0011 BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MURDER
6128-63240-0012 HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUNAH WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6128-63240-0013 SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY TO THE LATTER
6128-63240-0014 HAVE YOU BEEN IN NEW EUROPE
6128-63240-0015 NO I WOULDN'T BEEN ANYWHERE
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES IT SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT AND
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION RELATIVE TO MISSUS LENA
6128-63240-0018 I ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE
6128-63240-0019 AND MISSUS LENA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BETTER SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0020 ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK
6128-63240-0021 AND BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BUSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0022 THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE I NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED OVER HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNEY'S INDISCRETION AND HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS HAMILTON'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO YOUR THEATER PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LUNING'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSLOW THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO B E OE OTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNION'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002 RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THEIR REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER AS HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDENCY OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME AND TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMS TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE THAT BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN NECESSARY TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0009 OLIVE HAD A DREAD OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE FROM ALL
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET IT A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0012 HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEAD ACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTIONS AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BAZER RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF HAD THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE HIM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE LADIES ON BEACON STREET FEEL OVER THE BALLOT
6128-63244-0002 PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK WITH THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE
6128-63244-0004 OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE THEY WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0005 ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FAVENDER WHO LIVED AT RUXFORD OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINGFORD SUPPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0007 SHE WISHED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE FAMILY
6128-63244-0008 THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF REASONS BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0009 CHARLIE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A GREY OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH THE MOST
6128-63244-0010 OLIVE WONDERED HOW MISSUS BARRINGER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF A QUESTION
6128-63244-0011 IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING I
6128-63244-0012 THEIR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
6128-63244-0013 RAISE THE STANDARD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME YOUR FIRST NAMES
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CURRANTS MISSUS FARFRINGER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0015 SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSION OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0016 BUT I WON'T TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF YOUR SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
6128-63244-0018 THE UNSHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
6128-63244-0019 THEY WERE HER SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THAT DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT THE JUST REVOLUTION IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHERS THE BRUTAL BLOODSTAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0021 THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMEN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER THING THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF UNWISE MIST OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY A SUCCESS
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BIRD'S EYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL ASPECT AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEM ALREADY A MARTYR
6128-63244-0024 OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG UNREWARDED WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT NOR AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES AS AN OLD GLAZED AND DISTENDED GLOVE
6432-63722-0000 BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YOU FIGURE ON DOIN SOME PROTECTIN AND GIVING UP FISHING
6432-63722-0001 AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST AND AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
6432-63722-0002 I'M GOING OFF FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING AND MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GOT THERE
6432-63722-0003 GET READY SHAG YAS'A COLONEL
6432-63722-0004 AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HAD HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THIS EAST INDIAN
6432-63722-0005 PINKUS AND DONOVAN HAVEN'T THEY CARROLL YEP UP
6432-63722-0006 CARROT WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
6432-63722-0007 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON THAT CASE COLONEL
6432-63722-0008 BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT COLONEL THAN THAT RAT
6432-63722-0009 PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED COLONEL ASHLEY AND
6432-63722-0010 WE'VE GOT THE MEN AND THAT'S ALL WE WANT
6432-63722-0011 YOU'RE ON THE DARCYS CASE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YES
6432-63722-0012 I'M WORKING IN THE INTERESTS OF YOUNG MAN
6432-63722-0013 IT'S JEST ONE O THEM COINCIDENCES LIKE THAT
6432-63722-0014 BUTSTED HIS HEAD IN WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE OF A PAIR
6432-63722-0015 GAWD EXPLAINED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0016 THE VERY PAIR I WAS GOING TO BID
6432-63722-0017 HERE COLONEL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
6432-63722-0018 AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD AND AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGA PHAT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63722-0020 NOW I'M AFRAID THAT WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
6432-63722-0021 PUTE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED SHER ALI
6432-63722-0022 ANYHOW HE AND FUM DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL IT SEEMS
6432-63722-0023 NEIGHBORS OFTEN HEARD THEM SCRAPPIN A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
6432-63722-0024 TOWARDS DARK A MAN CAME IN TO BUY A LAMP
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND THIS VERY CANDLESTICK NEAR IT
6432-63722-0026 SURE HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT BACK
6432-63722-0027 MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOES TALKED IN THAT FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0028 AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT OH YES IT'S HERE
6432-63722-0029 THAT'S THE WATCH ANNOUNCED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE REACHING IN FOR IT GOIN YET SEE
6432-63722-0030 YOU'RE NOT AS SQUEAMISH AS ALL THAT ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DEAD MEN'S HANDS AND A WOMAN'S
6432-63722-0031 AND DONALM'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SKEPTICAL
6432-63722-0032 YES IT MAY HAVE SOME FRESH EDGES ON IT
6432-63722-0033 AND I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE REASON I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
6432-63722-0034 IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THIS VERY BIT
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT A SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO WAVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIME PIECES BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL
6432-63722-0038 AND DONOVAN TAKE YOUR FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
6432-63722-0039 ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE YES I
6432-63722-0040 DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF ON IT WHATEVER YOU ARE DO WHY NOT
6432-63722-0041 SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS WATCH HAD

6432-63722-0043 THE RIGHT BE THERE IN A SECOND
6432-63722-0044 SINGA' PHUT WAS THE PANTING ANSWER
6432-63722-0045 I WANT TO TALK OVER DARCY'S CASE WITH YOU THE COLONEL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD LAUGHED HAD TALKED AGAIN AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
6432-63722-0046 WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE EARL
6432-63722-0047 RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY COMPOSITION
6432-63722-0048 AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING FOR HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0049 AND YOU I DON'T WANT THEM EITHER
6432-63722-0050 BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I NOW
6432-63722-0051 BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING FOR FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK

6432-63722-0059 NOW THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW
6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILLFULLY PLAYED THE LOVELESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
6432-63723-0001 AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE NOW
6432-63723-0002 THE REASON SHE ASK'D NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENNETH
6432-63723-0003 NO I WASN'T TALKING OF THAT
6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR A DAY
6432-63723-0005 WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU KIN
6432-63723-0006 IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT YOU
6432-63723-0007 IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED INFINITE CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU SAYS THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0009 THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HER
6432-63723-0010 AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED AND
6432-63723-0011 HE LEARNED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012 SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND THEN SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0013 BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO RESISTANCE
6432-63723-0014 LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY UNDERSTOOD THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL FEES
6432-63723-0016 NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT SO HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0017 AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO BREAK IT UP
6432-63723-0018 STILL I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE OLD JEWELLER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0020 IT HE HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALL ROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT THE BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
6432-63723-0022 LANCH HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
6432-63723-0023 IN A TALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
6432-63723-0024 AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME SIMPLY THAT CYNTHIA RACHFORD HAD MARRIED
6432-63723-0025 TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED IN MONEY
6432-63723-0026 AND IN A WAY IT WERE TRUE
6432-63723-0027 SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING GOOD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
6432-63723-0028 AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVEATIONS
6432-63723-0029 THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCHER THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
6432-63723-0030 BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FACES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
6432-63723-0031 IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE GIRL
6432-63723-0032 MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING TO BE DONE ALWAYS REMAINED THE ANSWER
6432-63723-0033 BUT DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0034 I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT THAT WILL TAKE TIME
6432-63723-0035 AND IT'S HARD FOR MISS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP LIKE A MAJOR
6432-63723-0036 SO KING GOT BAIL WHO PUT IT BACK
6432-63723-0037 IT WAS HIME LARCH
6432-63723-0038 THEY TOOK HARRY AWAY A WHILE AGO AND
6432-63723-0039 BUT HIS ARE PRETTY UNCERTAIN SHOES WILL BE IN JUST THE SAME

6432-63723-0052 YES DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
6432-63723-0053 THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BELL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
6432-63723-0054 IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION AND KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
6432-63723-0055 I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND TOUCHED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
6432-63723-0056 HE WAS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELER
6432-63723-0057 NOW HAY KING HAS IT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY
6938-70848-0000 EVEN THE SUN CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY IN NOON
6938-70848-0001 THE COLDS AND RHEUMATISM OF THE RAINY MONTHS VANISHED AND
6938-70848-0002 ASKED A WORKER LAST NIGHT YOU DID IT WHEN THE YUNKERS
6938-70848-0003 WELL DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US ONE DAY EXHIBITED HIS ARM IN A SLING
6938-70848-0004 HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM ON THE DEVILS
6938-70848-0005 WHO ARE YOU TO DESTROY THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS LENIN A GERMAN
6938-70848-0006 WHO ARE YOU A COUNTER REVOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THE BELOVED ATOM
6938-70848-0007 YOU CALL YOURSELVES THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU ARE NOW THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA
6938-70848-0008 THE PIERANTS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS
6938-70848-0009 WE KNOW WHAT THE PEASANTS WILL SAY AREN'T THEY WE WORKING MEN LIKE OURSELVES
6938-70848-0010 THIS MAN AS SPECIALLY WELCOMED THE CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PEASANTS
6938-70848-0011 THIS LAST WERE THE YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAVE BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
6938-70848-0012 WHEREUPON THE OLD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE LEFT THAT HALL
6938-70848-0013 DOWN WITH HIM THEY SHRIEKD
6938-70848-0014 FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN WITH THE BOLSHEVIKE
6938-70848-0015 ON MY RETURN I HAVE VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANY ONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
6938-70848-0016 MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STRATUS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MIND
6938-70848-0017 BY DECLINING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO PUSH THE REELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LIFE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGREDIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
6938-70848-0020 THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO BREAK WITH THE WILL OF THAT PEOPLE
6938-70848-0021 FOLLOWED HIM OLENIN LISTENED TO ONE WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
6938-70848-0022 THE FIRST AGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALIST AND THE LANDOWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE KUGHTIE RELATED
6938-70848-0023 THE BUMESS AND ZAMSTOOLS WERE DROPPED
6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN CALLED
6938-70848-0025 HE SPOKE TO THE RUM CONVENTIONAL
6938-70848-0026 THE VILLAGES WILL SAVE ME IN THE END
6938-70848-0027 BUT THE PRESENT MOMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS HOW IT IS INVINCIBLE
6938-70848-0028 THE WILL OF THE MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN THE HALL
6938-70848-0029 A NEW HUMANITY WILL BE BORN AT THIS WAR
6938-70848-0030 I GREET YOU WITH THE CHRISTENING OF A NEW DRAGON LIFE AND FREEDOM
7018-75788-0000 THEN I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED HIM HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
7018-75788-0001 BEHOLD A FISH WAS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THE DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
7018-75788-0002 HEARING THIS I WAS SORE TROUBLED REGARDING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED FROM THE APE KIND
7018-75788-0003 UPON THIS HE BROUGHT ME A COTTON BAG AND GIVING IT TO ME SAID TAKE THIS BAG AND FILL IT WITH PEBBLES FROM THE BEACH AND GO FORTH TO THE COMPANY OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO WHOM I WILL GIVE A CHARGE RESPECTING THEE
7018-75788-0004 DO AS THEY DO AND BELIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FURTHER THY RETURN VOYAGE OF THY NATIVE LAND
7018-75788-0005 THEN HE CARRIED ME TO THE BEACH WHERE I FILLED MY BAG WITH PEBBLES LARGE AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLK ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH BEARING A BAG LIKE MINE FITTED WITH PEBBLES
7018-75788-0006 TO THESE HE COMMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO THEIR CARE AND SAYING THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY GET HIS DAILY BREAD AND HE WILL EARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
7018-75788-0007 NOW SLEEPING UNDER THESE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONG THE BUSHES WHEREUPON MY COMPANIONS BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE FOLK
7018-75788-0008 WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF HER DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
7018-75788-0009 SO IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINTH NIGHT
7018-75788-0010 AND CEASED NOT SAILING TILL WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT HUSSORAH
7018-75788-0011 THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTERS AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FOREGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STORE HOUSES
7018-75788-0012 AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GOOD PROFIT AND GAIN I HAD MADE
7018-75788-0013 NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING MOHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL CREATURES BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN WHO WISHED HIM A GOOD DAY
7018-75788-0014 HERE I FOUND A GREAT SHIP READY FOR SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD WITH THEM MUCH GOODS OF PRICE SO I EMBARKED MY BALES THEREIN
7018-75788-0015 HAPPILY AMONGST YOU IS ONE RIGHTEOUS WHOSE PRAYERS THE LORD WILL KEEP
7018-75788-0016 PRESENTLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE MAN AND BROKE UP AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD OF HER WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75788-0017 BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS COLOR AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE TRAVELLERS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNEW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
7018-75788-0018 EACH THAT DIED WE WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTHES AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE TILL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT A LITTLE PROVISION LEFT TO I WHO WAS WONT TO HAVE SO MUCH
7018-75788-0019 BUT THERE IS MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS GREAT
7018-75789-0000 WHEN HE WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST NIGHT
7018-75789-0001 THEN SIGNED FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND CORMORINE ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIP'S STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIX THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD MAKING ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
7018-75789-0002 LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE ON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS AN NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
7018-75789-0003 I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED WITH THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT IN MY TERROR AND CONCERN OF MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0005 WHEN I WOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND A RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
7018-75789-0006 BUT HE WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE RIVER
7018-75789-0007 WHEN THEY SAW I UNDERSTOOD THEM NOT AND MADE THEM NO ANSWERS ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER
7018-75789-0008 O MY BROTHER ANSWERED HE WE ARE HUSBANDMEN AND TILLERS OF THE SOIL WHO CAME OUT TO WATER OUR FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS AND FINDING THEE ASLEEP ON THIS RAFT LAID HOLD OF IT AND MADE IT FAST BY US AGAIN THOU SHOULDEST AWAKE AT THY LEISURE

7018-75789-0010 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SECOND NIGHT
7018-75789-0011 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HAD TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING THAT HE MAY ACQUAINT HIM WITH THE ADVENTURES
7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THEIR ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0013 SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT FOR THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND
7018-75789-0014 QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US ON OUR HEAD AND EYES BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST THEM WITH THY COMPANY

7018-75789-0016 THEN I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND OF ALL MY INSTRUMENTS AND ACQUAINTANCES IN THE ISLAND AND EMBARKED WITH THE MERCHANTS AFORESAID
7018-75789-0017 HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER
7018-75789-0018 FOR STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND UPON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND MAGISTRATES STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
7018-75789-0019 HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THIS AND AS FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST IS WITNESSED
7018-75789-0020 PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRYMAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SERVED
7018-75789-0021 SUCH THEN O MY BROTHERS IS THIS HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL ME IN MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TO MORROW INSHALLAH
7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX YEARS
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THE SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPENSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
7018-75789-0025 THAT SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMEN
7018-75789-0026 KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE AND ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH AND THE MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITABLE FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGHDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLIMBED TO THE MASTHEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OFF HIS BEARD
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IT IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT YOU WHOSO COME THITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS THE SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NOUGHT MORE DANGEROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THIS HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO PLATTERBAUGH'S GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE WALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY SEE THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD ARISE
7105-2330-0004 A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BYE ELECTION WITH THREATS OF THE HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ABOUT THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DONING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS THE FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATH LIKE HUSH
7105-2330-0007 THE FOREMAN DELIVERED HIS OWN MESSAGE
7105-2330-0008 THE JURY FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE OPERA HALL
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISH TO ADD A WRITER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A VIE ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS IN HAND
7105-2330-0010 AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THIS POLL A JUNIOR CONSUL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
7105-2330-0011 AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF
7105-2330-0012 OUR MAJORITY A LAST TIME WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN
7105-2330-0013 SEVEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE WILL AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTER PAFF IS OUT BEFORE THE POLE OPENS
7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RED RUPPIS INN TO NIGHT
7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRILOANA REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
7105-2330-0017 HE EXCLAIMED WON'T GET
7105-2330-0018 HE SAYS HE NEVER WAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM OUT AND HE'S NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW
7105-2330-0019 SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A RELEASED PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT FROM THE ESTIMATES
7105-2330-0020 THEN ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BAND
7105-2330-0021 PAUL OPENS IN FIVE MINUTE
7105-2330-0022 IS BLADDERBOFF OUT YET
7105-2330-0023 IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHY'
7105-2330-0024 THE CHIEF ORGANIZER RANG OFF AND
7105-2330-0025 THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY THAT MUSICIANS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
7105-2330-0026 CAN'T YOU GET A STRIKE PERMIT AT THE ORGANIZER
7105-2330-0027 I'LL TRY SAID THE HOME SECRETARY AND WENT TO TELEPHONE
7105-2330-0028 EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WE'LL DO THE OTHER WAY
7105-2330-0029 A TELEGRAM WAS BROUGHT IT IN
7105-2330-0030 IT WAS FROM THE CENTRAL COMETY ROOMS ON NEMESIS
7105-2330-0031 WITHOUT A BAND SHE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND
7105-2330-0032 BUT A QUARTER PAST TEN HALF PAST
7105-2330-0033 HAVE YOU ANY BAND INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY MEASURE TO PLAY
7105-2330-0034 DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANIZER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR THE DRUMS CYMBALS THOSE SORT OF THINGS
7105-2330-0035 THE WARDERS HAVE A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THESE MEN THEMSELVES
7105-2330-0036 LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISEER
7105-2330-0037 IN THE POPULAR SONG OF THE MOMENT REPLIED THE AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT TO THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONERS STRODE FORTH FOR FREEDOM
7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF THAT SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0040 THE SEAT WAS LOST AFTER ALL BY A YELLOW MATURITY
7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENSE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTER'S HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTERBATH FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
7105-2340-0000 WITH A NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIS HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON ONE WANTED IN ONE'S HOUSE
7105-2340-0001 WELL THE FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID THE HUSBAND OR NO DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE ESTATE
7105-2340-0002 BESIDES CYNICISM APART HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIS FAILIN
7105-2340-0003 WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY NOT MERELY WELL TO DO YOU ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVE NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THE THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY
7105-2340-0004 WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRED PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTEREFFLECTS OF A POLO ACCIDENT
7105-2340-0005 A WILFRED PICHENCOTE HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONOURS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRED HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK
7105-2340-0006 AND THE PREPARATION WAS AN UNPLEASANT ONE
7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOL DAYS ONWARD HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF CLEPTOMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION
7105-2340-0008 THE SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEONCOLE TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THEIR CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRED SAYING HE WAS PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS
7105-2340-0009 SIGNED WILFRED PIGEONOPTE
7105-2340-0010 I SUPPOSE HE'S BRINGING US A PRESENT FOR YOUR SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS
7105-2340-0011 THE WALK FLITTED NERVOUSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER
7105-2340-0012 IN THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER THEIR NERVOUSNESS AND AWKWARDNESSES INCREASED
7105-2340-0013 OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THAT SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETER SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUESTS HERE THEY ALL ARE
7105-2340-0014 SUCH NICE USEFUL GIFTS ARE A FEW DIPLICATES OF COURSE
7105-2340-0015 SEVEN CREAM JUGS TO PUT IN PETER
7105-2340-0016 WE WILL FEEL THAT WE MUST LIVE ON CREAM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
7105-2340-0017 OF COURSE SOME OF THEM CAN BE PROVED
7105-2340-0018 I HAD PUT IT DOWN BY THE CLARET JUG SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER OBJECT
7105-2340-0019 VIGILANCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY CROWNED WITH A SENSE OF LIBERTY
7105-2340-0020 AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR VISITOR MISSUS PETER EXPRESSED HER CONVICTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN SOME THING
7105-2340-0021 HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I'M HANGED IF I SHALL CARRY ONE OFF
7105-2340-0022 IS THE ONLY THINGS TO DO
7105-2340-0023 WILFRID WAS LATE IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MIND SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS
7105-2340-0024 IT'S AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT SUDDENLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU
7105-2340-0025 IT WAS A LITTLE PRESENT FROM MY MOTHER AND MYSELF FOR YOUR SILVER
7105-2340-0026 I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND I SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT RATHER AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING YOU ANOTHER
7105-2340-0027 NOT SNATCHER HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THESE MANY YEARS
7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNEST IN PIGEONCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPACT OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
7105-2340-0029 HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED BLANKLY AND DESPERATELY AT ONE ANOTHER AND
7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT NOTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE ARE AT BREAKFAST
7105-2340-0031 SHE ROSE AND LOOKED OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVER WARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS
7105-2340-0032 THE PIGEON COATS HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER BUT MISSUS PETER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION
7105-2340-0033 AND PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
7105-2340-0034 MISSUS PETER TURNED TO HER GUEST WITH CONFIDENTIAL COYNESSS
7105-2340-0035 PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS IT TRANSCENDS THE FAMILY GOOD LORD
7105-2340-0036 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A CLLEPTOMANIA LIKE COUSINS SNATCHER
7105-2340-0037 BRAVE LITTLE WOMAN SAID PETER WITH THE GASP OF RELIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT
7902-96591-0000 I'M FROM THE CUTTERS LYING OFF THE COAST
7902-96591-0001 DON'T CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO CALL
7902-96591-0002 AND AND YOU WHO HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
7902-96591-0003 I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME IF I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE
7902-96591-0004 THAT MY FATHER SIR ROSDON GRAHAM HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE
7902-96591-0005 HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YOU SHALL NOT DOUBT
7902-96591-0006 PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHIE WAS SILENT AND
7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE SWEET RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD REFSTROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 AND ALL COMES OF DRESSING OUT IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA SHOULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I'LL SOON SHOW THEM WHAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT PRESENTLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KICK ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTERS AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME OR LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED FROM THE STONE SILL
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT IT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0018 YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE TREE
7902-96591-0019 NO THAT WERE TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOSE WAS COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN TWO FACES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODIES WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE IF THE HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT KNOW IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
7902-96592-0000 SURE YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE FOR BOY YES FATHER QUITE

7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW TO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHIE REYSTROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER DREAMS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEALLE THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHY DID ANDY CALL MISTER GURRFATHER
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVALS OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0010 AND I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS ON I SUPPOSE
7902-96592-0011 NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SNOW
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TONIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT THE LOBSTER BOAT
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RETURN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARED NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRAPING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 WRENT WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE

7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE FARMER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE CHIMNEY HAS PRESENTED ITSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LEAP IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALISED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MAD
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASSAILING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE COULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE GIRK INTO ITS SHEATH

7975-280057-0000 THESE HATREDS WERE SO SOON TO MAKE TROUBLE FOR ME OF WHICH I HAD NEVER DREAMED
7975-280057-0001 HENRY WASHINGTON YOUNGER MY MOTHER REPRESENTED JACKSON COUNTY THREE TIMES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS ALSO A JUDGE OF THE COUNTY COURT
7975-280057-0002 MY MOTHER WHO WAS BESHEBA FRISTAUX OF INDEPENDENCE WAS A DAUGHTER OF RICHARD FRISTAUX WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON AT NEW ORLEANS JACKSON COUNTY HAVING BEEN SO NAMED AT MY GRANDFATHER FRISSEAU'S INSISTENCE
7975-280057-0003 I CANNOT REMEMBER WHEN I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FEED
7975-280057-0004 HIS BROTHER JAMES WAS BORN JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT JOHN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE AND ROBERT IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE
7975-280057-0005 MY ELDEST BROTHER RICHARD DIED IN NINETEEN SIXTY
7975-280057-0006 MY FATHER WAS IN THE EMPLOY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND HAD THE MAIL CONTRACT FOR NINE HUNDRED MILES
7975-280057-0007 HE HAD STARTED BACK TO HARRISONVILLE IN A BUGGY BUT WAS WAYLAID ONE MILE SOUTH OF WESTPORT A SUBURB OF KANSAS CITY AND BRUTALLY MURDERED FALLING OUT OF HIS BUGGY TO THE ROAD WITH THREE MORTAL BULLET WOUNDS

7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SAME PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF THE PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOUSE
7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS THE CORRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISONVILLE SHE WENT TO WAVERLEY WHICH SHE WAS HOUNDED CONTINUALLY
7975-280057-0018 ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT AT LESSINGTO WEEKLY
7975-280057-0019 ONE OF MY OLD SCHOOL TEACHERS WHOM I HAVE NEVER SEEN SINCE THE SPRING OR SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO IS STEPHEN B ELKINS SENATOR FROM SOUTH VIRGINIA
7975-280057-0020 WHEN I WAS TAKEN PRISONER I EXPECTED TO BE SHOT WITHOUT CEREMONY I
7975-280063-0000 WE TOOK THE OATH TO PERHAPS THREE HUNDRED OF US DOWN ON LUTHER MASON'S FARM A FEW MILES FROM WHERE I NOW WRITE WHERE COLONEL HAYES HAD ENCAMPED AFTER INDEPENDENCE
7975-280063-0001 BOOMYAIR AND MYSELF MET COFFEE AND THE REST BELOW ROSE HILL ON GRAND RIVER
7975-280063-0002 ACCORDINGLY I WAS SHORTLY AWAKENED TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO LOANJACK WHERE HE WOULD PERSONALLY MAKE KNOWN THE SITUATION TO THE OTHER JOURNALS
7975-280063-0003 FOSTER HAD NEARLY ONE THOUSAND KAVERMEN AND TWO PIECES OF RAB'S INDIAN IN A BATTERY THAT HAD ALREADY MADE FOR ITSELF A NAME FOR HARD FIGHTING
7975-280063-0004 COME IN COLONEL HAYES EXCLAIMED COLONEL COCKRE
7975-280063-0005 I THINK HE'LL BE RATHER TOUGH MEAT FROM BREAKFAST I REPLIED HE MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT FOR DINNER
7975-280063-0006 JACKMY WITH A PARTY OF THIRTY SEASONED MEN CHARGED THE INDIANA GUNS AND CAPTURED THEM BUT MAJOR FOSTER LED A GALLANT CHARGE AGAINST THE INVADERS AND RECAPTURED THE PIECES
7975-280063-0007 WE WERE OUT OF AMMUNITION AND WERE HELPLESS HAD THE FIGHT BEEN COMMENCED
7975-280063-0008 THEY DID MARK MY CLOTHES IN ONE OF TWO PLACES HOWEVER
7975-280063-0009 MAJOR FOSTER IN A LETTER TO JUDGE GEORGE M BENNET OF MINNEAPOLIS SAID OH
7975-280063-0010 I WAS TOLD BY SOME OF OUR MEN FROM THE WESTERN BORDER OF THE STATE THAT THEY RECOGNISED THE DARING YOUNG RIDER AS COOL YOUNGER
7975-280063-0011 ABOUT NINE HUNDRED A M I WAS SHOT DOWN
7975-280063-0012 THE WOUNDED OF THESE FORCES WERE GATHERED UP AND WERE PLACED IN HOUSES
7975-280076-0000 ALTHOUGH EVERY BOOK PURPORTING TO NARRATE THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS HAS TOLD OF THAT LIBERTY ROBBERY AND IMPLIED THAT WE HAD A PART IN IT THE YOUNGERS WERE NOT SUSPECTED AT THAT TIME NOR FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNISED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPARD RED MONCKERS AND BUD PENCE WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUANTRELLES
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAID WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BLOODSHED JUDGE MC LEAN THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT LATELY
7975-280076-0003 NO WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGERS BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED HER OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
7975-280076-0004 JUNE THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE OBICCOCK'S BANK AT CROYDON IOWA WAS ROBBED OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BY SEVEN MEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
7975-280076-0005 IT WAS CHARGED THAT ARTHUR MAC COY OR A C MC COY AND MYSELF HAD BEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE GAD'S HILL FAIR AND THE TWO STAGE ROBBERIES
7975-280076-0006 THE PARTIES OF THIS LETTER NOW RELEVANT ARE AS FOLLOWS
7975-280076-0007 YOU MAY USE THIS LETTER AND YOUR OWN WAY
7975-280076-0008 I WILL GIVE YOU THIS OUTLINES AND SKETCH OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND ACTIONS AT THE TIME OF CERTAIN ROBBERIES WITH WHICH I AM CHARGED
7975-280076-0009 AT THE TIME OF THE GALLETON BANK ROBBERY I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM PLEAZ TAILOR AND RECTOR
7975-280076-0010 THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SARAH BERKELEY AND FIFTY OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
7975-280076-0011 I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS CITY FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY
7975-280076-0012 SHE THEN WENT TO ARKANSAS AND RETURNED TO SAINT CLAIR COUNTY ABOUT THE FIRST OF MAY
7975-280076-0013 I WENT TO KANSAS WHERE OUR CATTLE WERE IN MOSON COUNTY AT COLONEL RIDGE'S
7975-280076-0014 DURING THE SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS BUT AS THERE WAS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED IN THAT SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE I WAS
7975-280076-0015 I WENT THROUGH INDEPENDENCE AND FROM THERE TO A TH WEBBS
7975-280076-0016 THERE I TOOK DINNER AND THEN WENT TO DOCTOR L W TWYMANS'S
7975-280076-0017 OUR BUSINESS THERE WAS TO SEE E P WEST HE WAS NOT AT HOME BUT THE FAMILY WILL REMEMBER THAT YOU WERE THERE
7975-280076-0018 WE CROSSED ON THE BRIDGE STAYED IN THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING WE RODE UP FROM THE CITY
7975-280076-0019 I MET SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AMONG THEM WAS ROBIN HUDSPETH
7975-280076-0020 WE WERE NOT ON GOOD TERMS IN THE TIME NOR HAVE WE BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS
7975-280076-0021 POOR JOHN HE HAS BEEN HUNTED DOWN AND CAUGHT LIKE A WILD BEAST AND NEVER WAS A BOY MORE INNOCENT
7975-280076-0022 DOCTOR L LEWIS WITH HIS PHYSICIAN
7975-280076-0023 THERE WERE FIFTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS THERE WHO WILL TESTIFY IN ANY COURT THAT JOHN I WERE THERE
7975-280076-0024 HELVIN FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WERE ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND EITHER OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE LOVE FOR JOHN AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MISTER SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND WAS IN HIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MISTER AND MISS FICKLE AFTER THE SERVICE
7975-280076-0025 ABOUT THE LAST OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO I ARRIVED IN CARROLL PARRISH LOUISIANA
7975-280076-0026 I STAYED THERE UNTIL THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR
7975-280076-0027 I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THE TIME I WAS AT NEOTIO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAE
7975-280076-0028 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY AT ADEAR IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY
7975-280084-0000 I URGED ON THE PEOPLE THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED WE SHOULD NOT SHOOT ANY ONE
7975-280084-0001 WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOODS BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT BACK INTO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
7975-280084-0002 WHEN YOU CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
7975-280084-0003 J S ALLEN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT THE MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
7975-280084-0004 GET YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY'RE ROBBIN THE BANK
7975-280084-0005 AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS AT THE BUSHES THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
7975-280084-0006 ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I SAW A PISTOL SHOT IN THE BANK
7975-280084-0007 CHADWELL WOODS AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO BE INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
7975-280084-0008 IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN WOODS'
7975-280084-0009 MEANTIME THE STREET WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY WHITE
7975-280084-0010 EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRAW THE SHOOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7975-280084-0011 DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UP THE STAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
7975-280084-0012 CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILLER'S MARINE
7975-280084-0013 WHAT KEPT YOU HERE SO LONG I ASKED PITTS
7975-280084-0014 AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THE BANK I GET THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0015 WHERE'S THE MONEY OUTSIDE THE SAFE BILL ASKED
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL FITZ FACED HIM WITH A BOLT
7975-280084-0017 THE FIRST ONES MISSED HIM BUT THE SECOND WENT THROUGH HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
7975-280085-0000 THAT NIGHT IT STARTED TO RAIN AND WE WORE OUT OUR HOUSES
7975-280085-0001 FRIDAY WE MOVED TOWARD WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMPED BETWEEN ELYCIA AND GERMAN LAKE
7975-280085-0002 BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARM HOUSE CLOSE TO MANCATHO
7975-280085-0003 THAT DAY A MAN NAMED DUNNER DISCOVERED US AND WE TOOK HIM PRISONER
7975-280085-0004 FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE AGREED NOT TO GO
7975-280085-0005 NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POST HASTE INTO MANCARTO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
7975-280085-0006 THE WHISTLE ON THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAS BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
7975-280085-0007 HE HAD A SLEEP WITH A PILLAR ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
7975-280085-0008 BUT THEY SOON AFTER GOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM BROKE MY WALKING STICK WITH A KNOT
7975-280085-0009 WE WERE IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG SAWED HORSES WHEN THEY CAST US OFF FROM THE ANIMALS AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
7975-280085-0010 SIX STEPS TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T O WALT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J C HEVERSON
7975-280085-0011 FORMING IN LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE OF THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THAT ROBBERS WERE DISCOVERED
7975-280085-0012 MAKE FOR THE HORSES I SAID EVERY MAN FOR MYSELF
7975-280085-0013 THERE'S NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHARGED THEM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN
7975-280085-0014 I GOT UP AS A SIGN FOR THE CHARGE AND WE FIRED ONE VOLLEY
7975-280085-0015 ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELLED ON BOB IN SPITE OF HIS HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS A FLAG OF TRUCE
7975-280085-0016 SHERIFF GLISPIN OF WATAPWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
7975-280085-0017 AND INCLUDING THOSE RECEIVED IN AND ON THE WAY FROM NORTHFIELD I HAD ELEVEN WOUNDS
7975-280085-0018 AND SHERIFF GRYSPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTECTORATE THAT MINNESOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
8131-117016-0000 CAPTAIN MURDOCK AND
8131-117016-0001 FOR MARSPORT HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO KILL IT OFF
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY ACTION OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MEN
8131-117016-0003 THE STONEWALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS FIFTEEN HUNDRED
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DARELXINE FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORIES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF A MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THERE NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUTSIDE
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO WATER
8131-117016-0007 CAPTAIN MURDOCK WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND THERE WAS ASKING FOR MORE MEN
8131-117016-0008 THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM FOR HIM
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED FOR WORKS WITH A SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE RELIEF
8131-117016-0010 I'VE GOT A FREE HANDS AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY WE WOULD ON EARTH
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERY ONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT OH GRAFT
8131-117016-0012 THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE UPON THE STONE WALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
8131-117016-0013 HE PICKED OUT FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FIVE WHO COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TO NIGHT PICK ANY ROUTE THAT'S OPEN O KY THEN LET'S GO
8131-117016-0015 BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCK'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH HOP
8131-117016-0016 TWO YEARS GRORDON ADMITTED
8131-117016-0017 FOR A SECOND GORDON CURSED HIMSELF THAT
8131-117016-0018 HE BEGAN WONDERINGLY ABOUT SECURITY THEN
8131-117016-0019 NOBODY HAD TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FOOT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHOB BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN OUR BEAT
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE CITIZENS WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THE FINELY TURNED CLUB OF HIS HANDS
8131-117016-0024 GORDON'S EYES POPPED WITH THAT
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWED THE SENTIMENT HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVED NOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER FOUR COPES HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
8131-117016-0027 HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND BY A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEYS
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COUPS STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0029 TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL THE WAGON IN
8131-117016-0030 WE'RE NOT USING WAGGS MURDOCK TOLD HIM LINE THEM UP
8131-117016-0031 IF THEY ALL TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED CAREFULLY
8131-117016-0032 MURDOCK INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND WITH TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS GREY AS GORDON'S FELT
8131-117016-0034 I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD THE WOMAN
8131-117016-0035 COLONEL THEY'D KILL ME I DON'T KNOW HOW
8131-117016-0036 MURDOCK TOOK HIS NODS AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND TURNED TO THE WRETCHED TUFTS
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL TRY YOU
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER THOUGH NO
8131-117016-0039 MURDOCK SENT ONE OF THE MEN TO PICK UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIXTY AND THEN A THIRD
8131-117016-0040 IN THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN HE'D BEEN BEATEN BEFORE
8131-117016-0041 GET A STRETCHER AND TAKE HIM WHEREVER HE BELONGS HE RETORTED
8131-117016-0042 BUT THE CAPTAIN STIRRED FINALLY SIGHING OH
8131-117016-0043 NO A COPSE THEY'RE GIVING ME WE'RE COVERED GORDON
8131-117016-0044 BUT THE STONEWALL GANG IS BACKING WEIGHTIN
8131-117016-0045 BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH ON THEM
8131-117016-0046 BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE GOT A YELLOW TICKET FROM SECURITY TO
8131-117016-0047 MURDOCK BLINKED HE DROPPED HIS EYES CLOSED
8131-117016-0048 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAINE WILL BE REELECTED
8131-117016-0049 NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER AND
8131-117016-0050 EVER SEE A MARTIAN ELECTRO
8131-117016-0051 NO YOU'RE A FIRSTER YOU CAN'T LOSE
8131-117016-0052 AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS OLD PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WHAT THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING GOOD FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0055 COST YE MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE IZZY IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE GETS IT
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEALS OF THE STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
8131-117016-0058 THE GROUPS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCK WAS TRAINING A WHOLE SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
8131-117016-0059 IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING THAT WAS HERE
8131-117016-0060 THIS COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS YOU'D SEEN ON EARTH
8131-117016-0061 BUT THERE WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAIN WAS REELECTED
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHOB BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING THEM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORISED PRECINCT HOUSE
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANY I HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117017-0002 AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HARLEIGH'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117017-0003 GORDON HIT THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MARS SPEAKER LET DOWN A SHRILL WHISTLE
8131-117017-0004 GUNS SUDDENLY SEEM TO BE FLOURISHING EVERY WHERE
8131-117017-0005 YOU CAN'T DO IT AND ME

8131-117017-0013 IT MUST HAVE BEEN OVER TWO THOUSAND CREDITS IN THE WALLET

8131-117017-0030 AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COUPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN ISSY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USE THE INFORMATION WITH A BEAT SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT TO THE UPPER BRACKETS HE'D STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS

8188-269290-0034 MISS LAUDDERDALE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHER TUTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE DIFFERENT HALLS ON A RAISED PLATFORM
8188-269290-0035 THEN A ROLL CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE AS ANY COLCHESTER

8188-269290-0048 AFTER THE ADDRESS THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION
8188-269290-0049 IT WAS PASSING TEN O'CLOCK WHEN SHE LEFT THE HALL
8188-269290-0050 JUST AS SHE WAS DOING SO MISS FREIR CAME UP
8188-269290-0051 ANY COLCHESTER IS YOUR ROOMFELLOW IS SHE NOT SHE SAID
8188-269290-0052 I SEE BY YOUR FACE MISSUS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DISTRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING ARE WE KEEPING ANYTHING BACK

8188-269290-0054 I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS LAWERDALE EXCEPT A VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED HERSELF
8188-269290-0055 EXCUSES MAKE NO DIFFERENCE OH
8188-269290-0056 THE GIRL WHO BREAKS THE RULES HAS BUT TO BE PUNISHED
8188-269290-0057 I WILL FOLLOW HER
8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHY THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTERESTS AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MONTMARIS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICIALS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE NATURAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0004 WHERE WAS THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER IT
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW AND FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME BEFORE MYSELF
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION AWAKE THOSE SLEEPING LIONS BY GROWLING UP A COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVE LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALL FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0007 HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE CONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE CORNEALTH
8188-274364-0008 MY LORDS I HAVE NOW TOLD YOUR LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG VANE FALLING ON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THE MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO PRYM WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO OTHER MONEY
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT OF
8280-266249-0000 OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF THEIR SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAIL CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS BUT ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOR
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THE ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0004 THERE ARE SOME NICE LOOKING PEOPLE ON BOARD OBSERVED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0005 BESIDES OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RANALD LAUGHING
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ANSWERED THAT LITTLE GROUP YONDER MY YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I SUPPOSE
8280-266249-0007 OR WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR HERALD I SHOULD JUDGE
8280-266249-0008 TO DO YOU SON WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009 HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE LADY
8280-266249-0010 SUPPOSE YOU AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRANKY
8280-266249-0011 I DO INDEED THOUGH SO PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF THEIR AILMENTS
8280-266249-0012 DOUBTLESS THAT IS IN THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMAN'S CABIN WHERE'S A LIGHT
8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY OF THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT OF TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF THE DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA IN FAINTING
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAINING SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0017 AND IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENTS
8280-266249-0018 THAT THE GREAT POLYTECHNICA INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS UPON THE MIND
8280-266249-0019 NOTICE THE MULTITUDE OF THE SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEWERS
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN A CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THE FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0021 AND THEN IN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0022 HENCE IN RESORT TO CIDER AND BEER
8280-266249-0023 NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT OUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN
8280-266249-0024 FOR YE ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD AND YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GODS
8280-266249-0025 WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR BODIES NEITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE WHOLLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD THIS IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DARLEY
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND FOR THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FORMER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0030 THEY'RE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MAN
8280-266249-0031 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN OUR DIRECTION
8280-266249-0032 NO SIR HE IS NOT IT
8280-266249-0033 WHEN THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TOO
8280-266249-0034 BUT THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0035 HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENES AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING TO HIS STATEROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0036 WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO CRIED ONE

8280-266249-0041 THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENT MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8280-266249-0042 A MAN OF GIANTS SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0043 LET ME GO YELLED WARD MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HER ARMS
8280-266249-0044 I DINKS NO I DINKS I DID YOU VON VASSIN RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
8280-266249-0045 THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOUR
8280-266249-0046 MISSUS LILBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0047 YET THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF THE PROFESSION
8280-266249-0048 IT KEPT IT UP TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT
8280-266249-0049 THEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP AND HIS STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0050 AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE FOR THE STAKES WERE VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0051 THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREEN BACKS THAT LAY BEHIND THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH A SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND
8280-266249-0053 WHEN ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS WITH A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
8280-266249-0054 IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED WARD LOOK WHAT'S THERE LOOK IF

8280-266249-0057 IT WAS HER LAST GAME OF CARDS FOR THAT TRIP
8280-266249-0058 THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO HER OWNERS
8280-266249-0059 TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DAILIES WERE IN GREAT STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0060 OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRIED TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE

8461-278226-0001 SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY WAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED A SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WEAR THEIR NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JUVIN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LOIS TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-278226-0003 I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES OF MODERN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
8461-278226-0004 I REMEMBER ALL THE REUBENS SAYS AT THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH A GRANDPAPA
8461-278226-0005 SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL A PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH POOR GREY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AYESHA BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0006 IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMEHOW BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0007 BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN AT THE GALLERY
8461-278226-0008 PHILIP JOSCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HE HIS WIFE MADE HIS DISCOVERY
8461-278226-0009 HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE PHILIP LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY AND

8461-278226-0012 THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF AT THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
8461-278226-0013 BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL THROUGH THE WORKS OF OTHERS
8461-278226-0014 I DON'T THINK THERE WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HOUSE
8461-278226-0015 AND YOU WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOR PHILIP IF YOU'LL SAY YES
8461-281231-0000 HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THE WOUNDED LEADER BEHIND THE WALLS
8461-281231-0001 IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORKILLSTONE
8461-281231-0002 AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH THE FEAR OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH SHE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
8461-281231-0003 WHAT ART THOU HE ANSWERED IN TERROR
8461-281231-0004 LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH EUREKA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTES THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
8461-281231-0005 EXCLAIMED THE NORMAN FOR
8461-281231-0006 REMEMBEREST THOU THE MAGAZINE OF FUEL THAT IS STORED BENEATH THESE APARTMENTS WHEN
8461-281231-0007 THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID EURAKA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO WOULD EXTINGUISH THEM
8461-281231-0008 MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHOUT
8461-281231-0009 THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY THE BLACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
8461-281231-0010 THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCED HIS WAY INWARD IN THE DESPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
8461-281231-0011 TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEIR LEADER'S EFFORTS TO STOP IT
8461-281231-0012 THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL WRUNG WITH IT FURIOUS BLOWS
8461-281231-0013 AT LENGTH DE BRACY PASSED
8461-281231-0014 TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK THY PLEASURE AND ME
8461-281231-0015 YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS THEE TO HEAR
8461-281231-0016 I EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER AND PERISH
8461-281231-0017 THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME YOUR CHAMBER
8461-281231-0018 RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH THESE THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN TO THE CARE OF THE TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS
8461-281231-0019 BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT AT DE BOEUF
8461-281231-0020 AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE UURECA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
8461-281231-0021 BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND ROSE TOWARD THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTERS
8461-281231-0022 AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED HER CHILDREN
8461-281231-0023 WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORAKLESTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
8461-281231-0024 HE LEFT THE GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF KOENIGSBERG AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ADDLESTAN WAS LAID
8461-281231-0025 DEBRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH A WOOD
8461-281231-0026 HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT AS A MEMORIAL OF HIS GALLANT BEARING
8461-281231-0027 SO SAYING HE MOUNTED THE STRONG WAR HORSE AND RODE OFF THROUGH THE FOREST
8461-281231-0028 DURING ALL THIS TIME THE ISAAC OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER REBECCA
8461-281231-0029 THEN WITH THIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
8461-281231-0030 THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FROM DE BOEUF I WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
8461-281231-0031 HE APPEALED TO THE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS PROJECT AND BECOME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
8461-281231-0032 BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LYCAS IN BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY
8461-281231-0033 HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY OR INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
8461-281231-0034 POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK AROUND AND TO MARK INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAS BEEN CONDUCTED
8461-281231-0036 SHE GAINED ACCORDINGLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
8461-281231-0037 ON HIS FEET WAS PLACED A TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
8461-281231-0038 THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THEIR SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE AND
