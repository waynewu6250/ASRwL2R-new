1688-142285-0000 THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANNON
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUESTS UP STAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME TOO SILLY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN THE SHOP BOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO ARE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING CHOPY AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WERE VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 TO HIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORK
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE DID NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION AND WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER OF THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARD TO IMMEDIATELY AND MISTER THORNTON IS NOT WONT I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO SHE LEFT MILTON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED ASKED HER
1688-142285-0016 OH PAPA BY THEIR TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE OR MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THAT WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS WHO NEVER SAID THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE THE WORDS
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO INTO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER MOTHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER OUT I CAME
1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL
1688-142285-0025 N I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0026 PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT TO ALL
1688-142285-0027 YOU DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0028 THAT GOOD NIGHT CHILD
1688-142285-0029 HERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN A BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED ON HER SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO A CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND SOFT WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THAT NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THE MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSURANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING AND REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK WITH HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL JACKY HOW ARE YOU
1688-142285-0038 BETTER AND NOT BETTER YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
1688-142285-0039 NOT EXACTLY REPLIED MARGARET LAUGHING
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER AND NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED O MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND OF BOOLAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED ROUND TO WALK LONG SIGHT OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
1688-142285-0042 BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DOES NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0043 AT LAST SHE ANSWERED IN A LOW VOICE
1688-142285-0044 BESSY DO YOU WISH TO LIE
1688-142285-0045 BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE EXPLAINED
1688-142285-0046 NOW WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
1688-142285-0047 WELL WHAT WAS IT
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON
1688-142285-0049 I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT THEY SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
1688-142285-0050 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I BE WITH YOU NOW
1688-142285-0051 THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGUERITE'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY TURNED ON INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
1688-142285-0053 YOU'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AN SPEAKS A BIT GROOVISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0054 BUT NICHOLAS WERE NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
1688-142285-0055 GASPED PESSY AT LAST
1688-142285-0056 BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FLEW BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER ME AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT TO YOU AND MADE WHAT IT IS
1688-142285-0059 NOW I'LL HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED TO
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND DO YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0061 I SEE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
1688-142285-0062 THAT'S WHAT I SUPPOSE YOUNG WOMAN
1688-142285-0063 I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT IN A BIG DEAL
1688-142285-0064 BUT WHO'S COME AT LAST AND WHO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS WHO'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT WHO KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT
1688-142285-0065 THAT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HARD TO WORK
1688-142285-0066 BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLAY IT THE MORE WITH MARGARET
1688-142285-0067 I DON'T THINK HARDLY ON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
1688-142285-0068 I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOAKED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF ARTHUR IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0069 THE FEVERISH COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEKS THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYE
1688-142285-0070 BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER WE SHALL OH MY HEART
1688-142285-0071 SHE PUT HER BACK TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALE
1688-142285-0072 MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON THE BOSOM
1688-142285-0073 PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING UP MARGARET'S GOWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
1688-142285-0075 I'LL COME TO MORROW SAID ROBERT
1688-142285-0076 AND MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
1688-142285-0077 SHE WAS READY FOR TEA AT HOME
1688-142285-0078 HAVE YOU MET WITH HER SERVANT DEAR

2033-164914-0007 THEN HE ALSO IMPROVISED THE TWO FOLLOWING DISTICHS
2033-164914-0008 WHEN NUSHAT AL ZAMAN HEARD THE FIRST IMPROVISATION SHE CALLED TO MIND HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER AND HER BROTHER AND THEIR WILHUM HOME THEN SHE WEPT AND CRIED TO THE EUNUCH AND SAID TO HIM WOE TO THEE

2033-164915-0000 AND THEREFORE THESE
2033-164915-0001 THEN SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HE GAVE HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN FELL DOWN IN A FAINTING FIT
2033-164915-0002 WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW THESE CASE HE WONDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEHOW TO COVER THEM WAITED TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
2033-164915-0003 AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND UZHAT AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND OPPRESSION LEFT HER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THESE VERSES
2033-164915-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANTS HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM HOW HE HAD GONE FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BUYING HE HAD MADE A MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD GONE IN TO HER AND HOW THE KING THEIR SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARRKEN
2033-164915-0005 BUT NOW GO TO YOUR MASTER AND BRING HIM QUICKLY TO ME
2033-164915-0006 THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED THE CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE STOCKER UNTIL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRDING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
2033-164915-0007 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE STOCKER GIRDED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING OH WOULD I KNEW WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM

2033-164915-0011 TWAS AS I FEARED THE PASSING ILLS DISCERNING BUT UNTO ALLAH WE ARE ALL RETURNING
2033-164915-0012 THEN THE EUNUCH CRIED UPON THE PAGES SAYING TAKE HIM UP THE ASS

2033-164915-0014 SO FARE YE FORWARDS NO HARM SHALL BEFALL YOU TILL YOU JOIN HIS GRAND WAZIR VANDAN
2033-164915-0015 THEN I BADE HIM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO KING OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND THE TRIBUTE OF SYRIA
2033-164915-0016 SO IT WAS AGREED THAT I GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARRKAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHER'S REALM

2033-164916-0002 WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAYNE TELL ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFELL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF HER LONG ABSENCE
2033-164916-0003 ZAUMA KHAN BOWED HIS HEAD A WHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THE POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELLED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM IN THE RIGHT WAY
2033-164916-0004 THEN HE ASKED O MY UNCLE HOW SHALL I DO WITH MY BROTHER SHARRKAN
2033-164916-0005 AFTER A WHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE POOL TIDED SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY

2414-128292-0018 THEN ONLY DID I HIT THEIR TRUTH
2414-128292-0019 HOW HAVE I STILL RECOLLECTION
2414-128292-0020 HAVE I STILL A BIRD
2414-128292-0021 A HAVEN TOWARDS WHICH MY SAILS SET

2414-128292-0023 OH ETERNAL EVERY WHERE O ETERNAL NOWHERE O ETERNAL IN VAIN
2414-128292-0024 THOU ART IN SHADOW
2414-128292-0025 SAID HE AT LAST SADLY AND
2414-128292-0026 THY DANGER IS NOT SMALL THOU FREE SPIRIT AND WANDERERS
2414-128292-0027 THEY SLEEP QUIETLY THEY ENJOY OUR NEW SECURITY
2414-128292-0028 BEWARE LEST IN THE END A NARROW FAITH CAPTURE THEE THE HARD RIGOROUS DELUSION
2414-128292-0029 FOR NOW EVERYTHING THAT IS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTETH THE
2414-128292-0030 THOU HAST LOST THY CORAL
2414-128292-0031 THOU POORE ROVER AND RAMBLER THOU TIRED BUTTERFLY
2414-128292-0032 WILT THOU HAVE A REST IN A ROOM THIS EVENING
2414-159411-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAHMIN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CALLED HIM
2414-159411-0001 THE BRAHMIN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THE CAGE YE WILL EAT ME
2414-159411-0002 O FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN TRUTH THAT I AM NOT
2414-159411-0003 I WILL NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OFF THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND RETURN
2414-159411-0004 THEN THE BRAHMIN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK WATER AFTERWARDS
2414-159411-0005 SO THE BRAHMIN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A BANANT TREE AND THE BRAHMIN SAID TO IT BANNANT TREE BANNANT TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0006 ON WHAT MUST I CARRY JUDGMENT ASKED THE BANDANT TREE
2414-159411-0007 THIS TIGER SAID THE BAMIN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF THIS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LEFT HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME
2414-159411-0008 IT IS JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR SO
2414-159411-0009 LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR YOU ARE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE
2414-159411-0010 SIR CAMEL SIR CAMEL CRIED THE BRAHMAIN HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0011 AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND A BULLOCK LYING ON THE ROADSIDE
2414-159411-0012 IS IT FAIR THAT HE SHOULD DO SO AND NOT
2414-159411-0013 LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN BUT MEN HAVE NO PITY
2414-159411-0014 THREE OUT OF THE SIX AND GIVING JUDGMENT AGAINST A BRAHMIN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINE TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
2414-159411-0015 ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT SAYS THE EAGLE
2414-159411-0016 THE BRAHMIN STATED THE CASE AND THE ANGEL ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONES
2414-159411-0017 THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID JUDGMENT OF ALL IS AGAINST YOU O BRAHMANS
2414-159411-0018 AFTER THIS THEY SAW AN ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMIN RELATED THE MATTER TO THEM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE VERDICT
2414-159411-0019 BUT THE ALLIGATOR SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KISS ME
2414-159411-0020 THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED A TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINION OF THE SIXTH JUDGE
2414-159411-0021 YET THE SIXTH WAS A JACKAL
2414-159411-0022 THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKAL UNCLE JACAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0023 SHOW ME THE PLACES
2414-159411-0024 THEN THE GUARD THERE THE YAKALS SAID NOW BRAHMIN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD
2414-159411-0025 ESPECIALLY THERE WAS IT ASKED THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0026 EXACTLY HERE REPLIED TO BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0027 WHERE WAS HER TIGER THEN
2414-159411-0028 WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE TYRANT JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON THIS SIDE
2414-159411-0029 VERY GOOD SAID THAT JACKAL BUT I CANNOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY
2414-159411-0030 SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE BRARMIN
2414-159411-0031 THERE SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0032 WHEN THE BRAHMIN HAD DONE THIS THE JACKALS SAID OH YOU WICKED UNGRATEFUL TIGER
2414-159411-0033 WHEN A GOOD BRAHMIN OPENED YOUR DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN HE WOULD MAKE
2414-159411-0034 PROCEED OF YOUR JOURNEY FRIEND BRAHMAN
2414-159411-0035 YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY AND HIS
2414-165385-0000 THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUETTE AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLATTERING POCAMP BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILISED MONKEY
2414-165385-0001 THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMIC WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU
2609-156975-0000 THEN MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING WAS KNOWN
2609-156975-0001 HOWDORN HOPHAST HODOUBT PATS SINCE HIS GENIUS
2609-156975-0002 LET'S HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MATRON MIGHT AND IN THE FAITH LET'S DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
2609-156975-0003 THE EGYPTIAN BASKET OF THE BONDAGE
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHOSE TURBANT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KIERNAPATH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIANS AND SCRIPZINS GIVE OF THAT PERIOD
2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE ABSOLUTELY NATURAL
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ALTAMI COVETS INTO THE HEBREW NATIONS FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES PROSTRATE TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDAH WERE THE CHIEF FACTORS IN ITS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
2609-156975-0008 THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREE REGARDING THAT DURATION OF THE SOJOURN IN EGYPT
2609-156975-0009 THE LATER TRADITIONS OF EXTEND THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAMES OF THE CITY PATUM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATAM
2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY IN SCRIPT AND ULSTER STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITTHAM THE HOUSE OF RAMESES A CITY WITH THE ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES
2609-156975-0012 THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS CYRENY WAS NATURALLY INEVITABLE
2609-156975-0013 WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM IT THE DESPOTIC ROAR OF THAT LAND A DAY
2609-156975-0014 THIS MAKING OF A LOYAL PATRIOT
2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES'S BIRTH ON EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
2609-156975-0016 WHERE'S MOSES JUST FINDIN RESISTIN THE GYPSIN TACT MASTER
2609-156975-0017 IS PENIONS ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
2609-156975-0018 NAT' TREE HE WENT TO THE LAND O MIDIAN
2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAS FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTS AND FUGITIVES
2609-156975-0020 FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND B C A
2609-156975-0021 ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUINE HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
2609-156975-0022 THESE SAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM CRIME TO CRIME UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KIDAM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN TIME THE PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0024 THE SCORE OF THE WEARINESSES
2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUET
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIEST OF THE SUBSTRIBE OF THE KINNITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0027 NOTE THE CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTALITY OF MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS THEIR LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF EM WENT UP WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KINITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAUWAY OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GUIDE WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0031 DO THE EARLIEST EBREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0032 THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST HAD MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0033 MOSES AND THE HOME OF THE MIDIAN PRIEST WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0034 THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM IN THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
2609-156975-0035 HIS QUEST WAS FOR A JUTS AND STRONG LINES ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES OF THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENS HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON THE POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN

2609-156975-0038 THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS INTRUSTED TO MOSES'S CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTIONS
2609-157645-0000 EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PRESENT FOR THE ROYAL FOE ON TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
2609-157645-0001 THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGUISING QUOD AT A SMOAKEN IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN

2609-157645-0013 GOING TO CHURCH SAINT HALE'S IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN A QUAINT IN A SIGNING SPIRIT
2609-157645-0014 WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCES FOUND OUT THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
2609-169640-0000 PARROTS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY THE SYPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE SEEST FOUR OF THEM AND FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACT OF VIOLENCE
2609-169640-0001 AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JIST KEPT STEERAGEWAY ON THE SHIP
2609-169640-0002 FORTUNATELY THE GIANT WAS NOT ONLY FAT BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS THE LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS IN UNLIVELY DANCE
2609-169640-0003 I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SIP POST HEE SPECTS EE IN MODERATE WEATHER
2609-169640-0004 MISTER MARBLE HE I DO B'LIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HINCOOPS BEIN LIKE THE SAILORS AS ONE MIGHT SAY FERRY ASLEEP
2609-169640-0005 AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE THOUGH FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN THE BOAT
2609-169640-0006 I SING OUT SAIL HOME AND CLOSE ABOARD
2609-169640-0007 HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WERE TO BE DONE
2609-169640-0008 THOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET TO OUR TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
2609-169640-0009 AS OUR SEATS WERE ALL LYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME A LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT
2609-169640-0010 I SOON SAW BOTH FRANTZ AND GLAD ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEAR
2609-169640-0011 MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS OFFICER AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCALS ABACK
2609-169640-0012 A PRACTICAL STILLNESS SUCCEEDED
2609-169640-0013 THE PROOTS DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED US FAST
2609-169640-0014 I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING HOUSES TOO AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
2609-169640-0015 KAIG WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
2609-169640-0016 THIS STILLNESS THAT REIGNED ON BOTH SIDES WAS LIKE THAT OF DEATH
2609-169640-0017 THE GERMAN BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME ROUND LIKE A TAR
2609-169640-0018 THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER WE COULD PASS HIM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
2609-169640-0019 THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INCIDENT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE IN THE CLOSEST SENSATION TO HIS ORDERS
2609-169640-0020 NOT A SOUL ON BOARD THE GRAND WAS HURT
2609-169640-0021 ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMEN THE FOUR SIXES TWO OUT OF THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERNMOST PROWA WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
2609-169640-0022 THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN ANGUISHED
2609-169640-0023 I DOUBT IF WE'D TOUCHED THE MAN IN THE NEAREST BOROUGH
2609-169640-0024 IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD OF HER CANVAS'S BINNED FORE LEAVING THE PROW A MOSTENOUS IN HER WAKE
3005-163389-0000 THEY STORMED UP IN FRONT OF SHIRBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK FOR THE NOISE
3005-163389-0001 SOME SUNG OUT TEARE DOWN THE FENCE TEAR DOWN THE FENCE
3005-163389-0002 THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY
3005-163389-0003 SHIRBURN RUN HIS EYE SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUTGAZE THEM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
3005-163389-0004 A AVERAGE MAN'S A COWARD
3005-163389-0005 BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE MANS FRIENDS WILL SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARK AND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
3005-163389-0006 SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH A HUNDRED MASKED CARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
3005-163389-0007 YOU DIDNT WANT TO COME
3005-163389-0008 BUT A MOB WITHOUT ANY MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT IS BENEATH PEACEFULNESS
3005-163389-0009 NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN UP ACROSS HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS HIS
3005-163389-0010 THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AND THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AND BUCK HARKNESS HE HEALED IT AFTER THEM LOOKIN TOLERABLE CHEAP
3005-163389-0011 YOU CAN NOT BE TOO CAREFUL

3005-163389-0013 AND ONE OR TWO CHILDREN BEGAN TO SCREAM
3005-163389-0014 SO THEN THE RING MASTER HE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THAT HORSE
3005-163389-0015 IT WARN'T FUNNY TO ME ALTHOUGH I WAS ALL OF A TREMBLE TO SEE HIS DANGER

3005-163399-0013 AND PRETTY SOON SHE MADE THE COLD CHILL STREAK ALL DOWN MY BACK BECAUSE SHE SAYS
3005-163399-0014 I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEAD I'D LIKE TO THROW UP MY HAND
3005-163399-0015 SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I'VE GOT TO RESK THE TRUTH
3005-163399-0016 I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE HE GOES
3005-163399-0017 MISSUS DON'T YOU SAY A WORD
3005-163399-0018 I SEE I WERE IN A FIX NOW
3005-163399-0019 MISSUS PHELPS SHE JUMPS AT HIM AND SAYS

3005-163399-0021 I CAN'T IMAGINE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MADE ME DREADFUL UNEASY
3005-163399-0022 UNEASY I SAYS I'M READY TO GO DISTRACTED
3005-163399-0023 HE MUST HA COME N YOU'VE MISSED HIM ALONG DE ROAD
3005-163399-0024 OH DON'T DISTRESS ME ANY MORE'N I'M ALREADY DISMISSED
3005-163399-0025 WHY SILAS LOOK YONDER UP THE ROAD AIN'T THE SOMEBODY COMING
3005-163399-0026 THE OLD GENTLEMAN STARED HE SAYS
3005-163399-0027 I HAIN'T NO IDEA WHO IS THERE
3005-163399-0028 IS IT TOM SAWYER
3005-163399-0029 BIG TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGHIN ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
3005-163399-0030 THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES UP ON THAT BOAT
3080-5032-0000 THAT I AM HUGELY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MY LADY
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER AS YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN BUT THE WORST OF HER
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUMOUR AND DISPOSITION WILL MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
3080-5032-0003 WHY DO YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND A GARLAND
3080-5032-0004 WELL THE BEST ON IT IS THAT I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT'S AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGES
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITHAL AND ALL THE KINDNESS THIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULTS AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
3080-5032-0008 TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I'M VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I WILL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS A SQUIRE OF DANE'S AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND TO SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CAN NOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0010 I THINK MY YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES UP WITH HIM
3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUT THEY LIVED BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0012 AND IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAVE HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER IN WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0014 BUT BESIDES I CAN GIVE YOU THE OTHERS
3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY UNCLE AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0016 HE WILL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY GET IT
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS A JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMOURS EVERY BODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBORS
3080-5032-0019 THAT MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE THEY WERE FIT FOR YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 WHY CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY DAUGHTER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE BUT MUCH MORE COMMONLY
3080-5032-0024 AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARNED SINCE
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM SHAKE MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETERS
3080-5032-0026 HOW KINDLY DO I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHER'S IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LETTERS PLEASED ME
3080-5040-0000 WOULD IT NOT LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY EVERYBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAD TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMASH
3080-5040-0003 I WONDER WHETHER SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO BELIEVE IN BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I CAN NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING TO BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I WOULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTERS TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW IT OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
3080-5040-0008 MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGONE THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED
3080-5040-0009 DO YOU SEE I GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING
3080-5040-0010 BY THE NEXT I SHALL BE DRAWN INTO KENT AND MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR INTERCOURSE VERY MUCH

3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHID WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE WITH ME
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LAY MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS THAN THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING IT
3080-5040-0021 YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE AND THIS THAT I ESCAPED DROWNING
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WRITE BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0023 HOW WELCOME YOU MUST BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DETAIL AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LIKED TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND FLY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS WHEN WE HAVE TIME
3080-5040-0027 ALL IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
3080-5040-0028 IT WILL YOU BE SO GOOD NATURED
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS THE FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN AN AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MIGHT GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THUS WITH DISCOURSES OF THE FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER OCCASION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SUPPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OF HER AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO ASK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASE COCK WITH NINE PEAS IN IT UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PATER INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
3331-159605-0001 THE MORE TROUBLES THE MORE CREDIT
3331-159605-0002 I'VE TRIED IT AND BELIEVED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSING IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES
3331-159605-0004 WHAT A SPITEFUL ONE I AM
3331-159605-0005 I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME THOUGH I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 TELL ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN
3331-159605-0007 HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HE HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF A DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOUR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION WHICH MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING THAT WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HER CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLUTTERED HER MORE THAN SHE COULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN HESITATE
3331-159605-0014 MARY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SIDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATIONS WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPIRITS OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BACKY AND BESS BUT COULD NOT RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FIN THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO THE DOCTOR BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASSA CHARLIE'S HAND MISS MAMMIE AND WALK PRETTY LIKE BILLIE AND FLOSSIE SAID THE MAID
3331-159605-0019 AT A STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOLBOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLE HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND CALM AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULD NOT HELP THAT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT'S THE WAY I GET TO THE ROS ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO KNOW BUT HIS FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE OF GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0025 TELL YOU NO
3331-159605-0026 HOW LOVELY THE PORCH LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH HARRY IMMEDIATELY FELL
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE HER HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
3331-159605-0029 SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BUOYANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY OUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WORLD LIKE LEVERLY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE SHOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVOURITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WERE WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 WORKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL AND WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
3331-159605-0034 SHE'LL CHILLED HIM
3331-159605-0035 EARLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PEDDLE IN THE PODDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBERS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTIONATE POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS NOT HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0038 DON'T YOU THINK YOU MEANS TO
3331-159605-0039 TRULY JULIE THEN
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT WE DID
3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I'D GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
3331-159605-0042 I ONCE GAVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THEY'D THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT SIDDY TATTLERS SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHANDELLAMAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0046 I'M APT YOU KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY OF NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WHITEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY OPERATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT NOW FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED WHILE HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT HER LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKED TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NO I AM ONLY TIRED HAD A GREAT DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT'S THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU ARE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FROM ME
3331-159609-0008 THEN THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
3331-159609-0009 CRIED MAGGIE WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0010 POOR SYLVIA WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELLED FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKINGLY AND I FELT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GET BEFORE
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER AND ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATED THEIR RESPECTIVE VERES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I THINK MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 CRIED FANNY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM THE CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO SAY THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT WINTER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SIDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE A HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNES MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING FOR A BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORES
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT NIGHT AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE PAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 MAGGIE CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORKBASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE KNOW
3528-168656-0000 SHE HAVE EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS THEIR PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR OF SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUCEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUCIBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOLGIRL WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHTERS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HIM BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF FONTRELL DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0006 SHE WOULD NOT SHOW THIS OBJECT TO EVERYONE
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENTS
3528-168656-0008 SOME UNIQUE CHAPLET SOME AUTHENTIC RELICT
3528-168656-0009 THEY LOST THEMSELVES TO CONJECTURES
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN IS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT THE DANCERS IS LAUGHING WITH A SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0012 MORAL LOVE CONTRACTED BY THE COLIC
3528-168669-0000 THE PRIORESS RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HIS CHAIR
3528-168669-0001 WILL PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0002 FATHER FAOVENT
3528-168669-0003 REVEREND MOTHER DO YOU KNOW THE CAPEL
3528-168669-0004 AND YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR STUDIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
3528-168669-0005 THERE IS A STONE TO BE RAISED FIFTY
3528-168669-0006 THE SLAPE OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0007 IN THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT YES
3528-168669-0008 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN IN IT
3528-168669-0009 A WOMAN IS THEREFORE A MAN
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DAM BABYLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLONUS HORSES ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERLONUS HORSES NEITHER DO I
3528-168669-0011 MERIT CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER NOT A DOCK YARD
3528-168669-0012 AND A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONGER ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0013 AND CAN YOU SET A LEVER
3528-168669-0014 THERE IS A RING IN THE SUN
3528-168669-0015 I WILL PUT THE LEVER THROUGH YOU
3528-168669-0016 THAT IS GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I WILL OPEN THE VAULTS
3528-168669-0017 WILL THAT BE ALL NEW

3528-168669-0019 FLAUVENT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
3528-168669-0020 I AM FREE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WISH
3528-168669-0021 AND TO HOLD YOUR PEACE ABOUT EVERYTHING YES REVEREND
3528-168669-0022 WHERE THE VAULT IS OPEN I WILL CLOSE IT AGAIN
3528-168669-0023 BUT BEFORE THAT THAT REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0024 FATHER PHUVAIN REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0025 YOU KNOW THAT A MOTHER DIED THAT MORNING
3528-168669-0026 YOU DID YOU NOT HEAR THE BELL
3528-168669-0027 NOTHING CAN BE HEARD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN MERELY
3528-168669-0028 AND THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN THAT DIRECTION THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0029 IT WAS THERE CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN OTHER CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER AH
3528-168669-0031 THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS INTO THE CHURCH I KNOW
3528-168669-0032 A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEADHOUSE MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0033 HEI MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0034 WHAT DOES YOU SAY
3528-168669-0035 I SAY MORE OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN THIS
3528-168669-0036 REVEREND BROTHER I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT I SAID MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0037 THAT I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0038 AT THAT MOMENT NINE O'CLOCK STRUCK AND
3528-168669-0039 AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT ALL HOURS PRAISED AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR SAID THE PIRESS
3528-168669-0040 IT CUT MORE COMMON SHORT
3528-168669-0041 THEN FAUCHELEVENT MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD
3528-168669-0042 IN HER LIFETIME MOTHER CRUCIFIXION MADE CONVERTS AFTER HIS DEATH SHE WILL PERFORM MIRACLES SHE WILL
3528-168669-0043 FATHER FAUVIN THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED WITH MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0044 SHE RETAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE VERY LAST MOMENT
3528-168669-0045 SHE GAVE US HIS LAST COMMANDS
3528-168669-0046 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN AT HERSEL SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0047 THERE WAS NOTHING OF PARADISE IN THAT DEATH
3528-168669-0048 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORISON WHICH SHE WAS VISITING
3528-168669-0049 FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE SHE WENT OUT
3528-168669-0050 I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABORING IN OUR LAND WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT
3528-168669-0051 FORTUNATELY THE BRIESS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT
3528-168669-0052 SHE CONTINUED FATHER FERVENS
3528-168669-0053 YES REVEREND MAMMA

3528-168669-0069 SHE ASKED IT FOR US THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDED US
3528-168669-0070 WHAT IT IS FORBIDDEN
3528-168669-0071 OH I AM A STONE IN YOUR SHOES

3528-168669-0130 I WILL KEEP THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS IN PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT IF SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVERS
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PERFECTLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH STRONGLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT THE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VALUABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN TWENTY NINE
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM OFF THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE EASILY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS TO SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN A STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND STIRRED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS THUS THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTE ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE THEN IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THERE ARE PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN HUNDRED THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE UPON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONERY IN FIFTEEN O EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFORCET TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER AND THEY NOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF YOUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL IN CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 THAT ISIS
3538-142836-0024 AT DESSERTS OR AT ANY EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE SCATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITIONS
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THAT NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WERE STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME MY GIRL SAID THE HEAD
3538-163619-0004 AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE QUEEN'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME ON SIGHT OF LAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO THAT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY BROTHER SINGING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 UPON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLDEN DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE GOLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THAN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPING DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GOT A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOWLS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LADY CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES IT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE OUT ALMOST TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 THEN THE KING PROMISE HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF AS SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SISTER AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THEIR FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE OF LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SIBBER LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDER LADD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID SUNDER LAD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID SINDER LADE
3538-163622-0014 THEN THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG TIME THE FOAL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS BRIGHT SAID SINDER LAD
3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKED LIKE THE TRUNKS OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SINDERBAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE WAS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE FOE SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE MOLE DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT WAS A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDERIND
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS DEAD
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD MAN WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MUST BE HEALED
3538-163624-0003 SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING THEN SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAYS DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHERS DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSONS WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE ROOM WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REGAN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF ICE AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S SWORD AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGURD SAID THAT LORD WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 AND HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THAT SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I COULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 FOR ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FAFFNER AND THEN STEPNA DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAVNER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 BUT SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNER ON A STEAK AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THERE'S SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINFALD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WOULD SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 NOW HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY UNTIL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 LYN BENHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAMES IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUDRAN WERE BATHING BRUNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRAN'S SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAS RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO FIGHT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
367-130732-0000 LOBSTERS AND LOBSTERS ARE
367-130732-0001 WHEN IS A LOBSTER OR A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION IN ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO IN THE PRIMARY OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF A CALIFORNIAN
367-130732-0004 A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THAT ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLDWIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER ALE NEUBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DOMONICO
367-130732-0006 LOBSTER ELLEN NEW BOG

367-130732-0010 JOHN OF SHELLFISH
367-130732-0011 ONE HAS TO COME INTO SAN FRANCISCO TO PARTAKE OF THE KING OF SHELLFISH THE MAMMOTH PACIFIC CRAB
367-130732-0012 I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COASTS IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUSLY AS AT SAN FRANCISCO
367-130732-0013 GOBY'S PASSED WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW AT UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE LOBIES OF BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PRESTIGE DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
367-130732-0015 GOBER'S CRAB STEW
367-130732-0016 KEEP THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT ALL THE FAT FROM THE SHELL
367-130732-0017 SOAKED THE CRAB MEAT IN A SHERRY TWO HOURS BEFORE COOKING

367-130732-0020 SERVE IN A CHAFING DISH WITH TOASTING CRACKERS OR THIN SLICES OF TOASTED BREAD
367-130732-0021 LOBSTER FOR MINIATURE
367-130732-0022 SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE HOLL BROW HAS BEEN MAKING A SPECIALITY OF THEM
367-130732-0023 ALL THE BETTER CLASS RESTAURANTS HOWEVER WILL SERVE THEM IF YOU ORDER
367-130732-0024 THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR TWO PEOPLE AND IT IS WELL WORTH TRYING IF YOU ARE GIVING A DINNER OF IMPORTANCE

367-130732-0029 ALLOW THIS TO BOIL AND THEN ADD A QUART OF STRONG CONSEN AND LET ALL CONTINUE BOILING FOR HALF AN HOUR
367-130732-0030 PICK OUT THE CRAWFISH AND STRAIN THE BROTH THROUGH A NAPKIN BY PRESSURE INTO A BASIN IN ORDER TO EXTRACT ALL THE ESSENCE FROM THE VEGETABLE

367-293981-0011 TO BE BRIEF HE TOOK THE MATERIALS OF WHICH HE HAD MADE A COMPOUND MIXING THEM ALL AND BOILING THEM A GOOD WHILE IT UNTIL IT SEEMED TO HIM THEY HAD COME TO PERFECTION
367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE PISIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED IT DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY LITTLE MORE THAN HIS MASTER
367-293981-0014 IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT RETURNED SARAH WOE BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KINDRED WHY DID YOU LET ME TASTE IT
367-293981-0015 SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THIS KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU BY THE LETTER OF KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOU SATISFACTION AND REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRE
367-293981-0016 THERE THIS IS AN INN SAID DON QUIXOTE
367-293981-0017 AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE THE INNKEEPER
367-293981-0018 THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLANKETED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW ADVANCE WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS SQUIRE WHO UTTERED THEM
367-293981-0019 HE SAW HER RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
367-293981-0020 SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THE BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINK AND TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
3764-168670-0000 THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THAT GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
3764-168670-0001 COSETTE HAVE WAKED UP
3764-168670-0002 JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED HER BY THE FIRE
3764-168670-0003 IF YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE I SHALL COME TO FETCH YOU
3764-168670-0004 BUT EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
3764-168670-0005 I HAVE PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE KEPT OUT
3764-168670-0006 THAT'S WHY THE DIFFICULTY LIES
3764-168670-0007 IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THE CHILD HE WILL CARRY HER OUT
3764-168670-0008 IF SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE I ANSWER FOR THAT
3764-168670-0009 FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEANNE VALJEAN
3764-168670-0010 YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE THIS
3764-168670-0011 JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND FELT THAT HE WAS RAVEN
3764-168670-0012 FAUCHELEVENT WENT ON IN
3764-168670-0013 IT IS TO MORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECTING YOU
3764-168670-0014 THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENCE FOR A SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE COMMUNITY
3764-168670-0015 THAT THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN HER COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
3764-168670-0016 THAT THE PRIORESS AND THEIR VOCAL MOTHERS INTENDED TO FULFILL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
3764-168670-0017 THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THE CELL RAISE THE STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE INTO THAT VAULT
3764-168670-0018 AND THEN IF THERE WAS ANOTHER THE EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0019 IT IS THAT EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0020 AND ASKED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
3764-168670-0021 WHAT THE COFFIN WHAT ADMINISTRATION
3764-168670-0022 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST ON HIS CHAIR YOU
3764-168670-0023 YOU KNOW FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IS DEADLY
3764-168670-0024 AND I ADD AND FATHER MADELEINE IS BURIED OR
3764-168670-0025 YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN THE FATHER MADELEINE
3764-168670-0026 THIS OFFERS THE MEANS GIVE ME YOUR INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
3764-168670-0027 HOW LONG AS THE COFFIN SIX FEET
3764-168670-0028 IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH WITH CHURCH
3764-168670-0029 THE CHURCH IN THE STREET THERE THE CHURCH WHICH ANYONE CAN ENTER
3764-168670-0030 HAVE YOU THE KEYS IN THOSE TWO DOORS
3764-168670-0031 NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH A CHURCH
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKERS MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY GO TO GET THE COFFIN
3764-168670-0033 YOU NAILS UP THE COFFIN I DO
3764-168670-0034 WHO SPREADS THAT PALL OVER IT
3764-168670-0035 NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR MAY ENTER THE DEAD ROOM THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
3764-168670-0036 COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THE ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN EVERYONE IS ASLEEP
3764-168670-0037 ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON I
3764-168670-0038 I SHALL BE HUNGRY I WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING
3764-168670-0039 YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP IN THE COFFIN AT FOUR O'CLOCK
3764-168670-0040 FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKLED HIS FINGER JOINTS BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
3764-168670-0041 BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE THE HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS AND A PLANK
3764-168670-0042 THAT JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS THAN THIS
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FILL THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
3764-168670-0044 WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A CORE
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BAILE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANKS LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0047 A MAN WHO IS MAKING ITS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE
3764-168670-0048 WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO A MAN DO COME IN
3764-168670-0049 THE OVERPRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN AUDACIOUS
3764-168670-0050 AS JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I HAVE SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
3764-168670-0052 A OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0053 I SHALL FOLLOW THAT WAS MY BUSINESS
3764-168670-0054 THE EARTH HALTS THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN KNOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0055 THE PRIEST SAYS HER PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE MUST EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER
3764-168670-0057 THAT IS SETTLED FATHER FAUCHELEVENT WILL GO WELL
3764-168671-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAINT PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEARS
3764-168671-0001 THIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A STRANGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
3764-168671-0002 A MORNING COAT IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
3764-168671-0003 BEHIND HIM CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABOURER WHO LIMPED ALONG
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING IN SUMMER AND AT NIGHT AND WINTER IN THE CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES ON THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES
3764-168671-0006 DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT BUT FLOWERS WERE DESERTING IT
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VOUGERA IT HINTED AT POVERTY PER LACHEISE IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHETES IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0009 THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN INTO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENSE IN OUR SIGHT
3764-168671-0010 IT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLED A DUTY
3764-168671-0011 THE NUNS HAD CREATED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
3764-168671-0012 IN THIS CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0013 MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MAN BUT KEEP THEM TO YOURSELVES
3764-168671-0014 A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRIEST
3764-168671-0015 FAUCHELEVENT LIMPS ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0016 JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLITIES THAT ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0017 WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS OF A MERE NOTHING
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESTRIAN
3764-168671-0019 HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WISDOM
3764-168671-0020 THE PURPOSE FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGER POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0022 THE MAN REPEATED THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0023 THE GRAVE DIGGER HERE
3764-168671-0024 AND YOU I
3764-168671-0025 FATHER MYSTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
3764-168671-0026 FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS BUT A GRAVE DIGGER TO DIE
3764-168671-0027 IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT BRAVE DIGGERS DO DIE THEMSELVES
3764-168671-0028 HAD HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STAMMER
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER MATSIENE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LENORA IS HERE'S A JUG OF RED WINE
3764-168671-0031 BUT YOU IS A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
3764-168671-0032 HAVE YOU NOT COMRADE WE'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
3764-168671-0033 THE MAN ANSWERED
3764-168671-0034 HE LIMPED MORE OUT OF AGONY THAN FROM INFIRMITY
3764-168671-0035 THE GRAVE DIGGER MOVED ON IN FRONT OF HIM
3764-168671-0036 FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED CREVILER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A COMFORTABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER HE MUTTERED
3764-168671-0038 YES SIR FATHER MASTIAN IS DEAD
3764-168671-0039 THE MAN REPLIED COMPOSED
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTEBOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER ESTIENNE'S TURN FATHER MESTHIERNE DIED
3764-168671-0041 STAMMERS FAUCHELEVENT IT IS MADE
3764-168671-0042 YOU YOU ARE A PEASANT I AM A PARISIAN
3764-168671-0043 FAUCHELEVEN THOUGHT I AM LOST
3764-168671-0044 THERE WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUN'S QUARTER
3764-168671-0045 AND HE NODDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED SPEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE BRITANIUM TOWN HALL
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF THE AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0049 SO YOU HAVE NOT A GRAVE DIGGER THEN
3764-168671-0050 RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE THOUGH IT WAS
3764-168671-0051 IF A REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY
3764-168671-0052 FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH WANTED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053 THAT GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE
3764-168671-0054 ONE MUST KEEP
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKENED
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHY
3997-180294-0002 WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR BUT
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO
3997-180294-0005 NOW GET I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME AS THOUGH THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST SIGN OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH WHICH CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0009 BUT HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VEIL
3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNT UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELING
3997-180294-0011 THEY LOVED BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCTS
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE AND IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0013 THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF TO HAVE
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABORERS IN A FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0015 THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN AND THEY LOVE SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LIFE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAIS SONG
3997-180294-0018 WHEN I REACHED HOME I WERE IN A STATE OF MAD GAIETY
3997-180294-0019 THE WOMAN BECOMES HER MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 HOW I
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORD WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO FIGHT AT THE VAUDEVILLE
3997-180294-0023 COME DURING THE THIRD EN TRACTE
3997-180294-0024 THE BOX WAS FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY TO THE STAGE BOX
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I SAW THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0027 DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOK THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0028 THAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 YE SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0030 FOR AT HOME
3997-180294-0031 YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU HELP
3997-180294-0032 BESIDES YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
3997-180294-0033 NONE THE LESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GETTING INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0000 AND I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
3997-180297-0001 WE ARE IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
3997-180297-0002 WELL WE MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE
3997-180297-0003 DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT THEM ATTENTIVELY
3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU COME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO THE GREATEST HARM
3997-180297-0007 IS THAT REALLY THEIR ONLY REASON
3997-180297-0008 IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE WERE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
3997-180297-0009 HONESTLY IF YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
3997-180297-0010 I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THEIR HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0011 WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GET
3997-180297-0012 I LISTENED AND THEN I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MEN'S DESIRES HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTICAL DESIRES AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOPED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 WE NO LONGER BELONGE TO OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017 WE STAY FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEM LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER DO THEY GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT UNCRATIVE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO A BOX AT THE THEATRE
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS OR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0021 I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH THEY OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVED AND KNEW WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH ITS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0024 MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR OUT THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
3997-180297-0025 MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID OH
3997-180297-0026 HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT THEM BACK
3997-180297-0027 I TORE THIS LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME
3997-180297-0028 LOOK HERE PRUDENCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANTS SAID MARGUERITE
3997-180297-0029 SHE WANTS YOU TO FORGIVE HIM
3997-180297-0030 ONE HAVE TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT THEN
3997-180297-0031 I EMBRACED MARGUERITE UNTIL HE WAS ALMOST STIFLED
3997-182399-0000 OR MISTER BUZZARD GRINNED
3997-182399-0001 HIS SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER STORY
3997-182399-0002 HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK HEADED COUSIN OF ALL MISTER BUZZARD VERY CURIOUS INDEED

4198-12281-0005 LORD GOD DAH ME HE POTUM
4198-12281-0006 LET HIM BE TAKEN TO PRISON FOR TROUBLING THE DIVINE SERVICE
4198-12281-0007 WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN THAT ADVENT AND ALL THE WINTER
4198-12281-0008 HARK YOU MY MASTERS YOU THAT LOVE THE WINE COPSE BODY FOLLOW ME FOR SAINT ANTHONY BURNED ME AS FREELY AS A FAGGOT THEY GET LEAVE TO TASTE ONE DROP OF THE LICORE THAT WILL NOT NOW COME AND FIGHT FOR RELIEF OF THE VINE
4198-12281-0009 TO OTHERS AGAIN HE UNJOINTED THE SPINDELLS OR KNUCKLES OF THE NECK DISFIGURED THEIR CHAPS GHASHED THEIR FACES MADE THEIR CHEEKS HANG FLAPPING ON THEIR CHIN AND SO SWINGED AND BELAMMED THEM THAT THEY FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM LIKE HAY BEFORE A MOW
4198-12281-0010 TO SOME WITH HIS SMART SOUS ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDRIFTS WAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOME PUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
4198-12281-0011 SUPPOSE THAT IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER ONE SAW
4198-12281-0012 O THE HOLY LADY NITIL SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTUS O OUR LADY OF SUCCOURS SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP
4198-12281-0013 SOME DIED WITHOUT SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE WITHOUT DYING SOME DIED WITHOUT SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE IN DYING
4198-12281-0014 CAN YOU TELL WITH WHAT INSTRUMENTS THEY MADE IT
4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEANTIME FRIAR JOHN WITH THIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVORED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASER BY THE ADHERENCE OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 AT THE BEGINNING OF HER REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT CHARDURAS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
4198-61336-0003 TIGLATH PALLISER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE EURENTIAN ARMY IN CUMAC
4198-61336-0004 A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED BUT ONE OF ITS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING GERDORUS WHO LEAPED FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST DURTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0007 THE SIFTI MATTI ILIU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHAWDDORUS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TIGLATH BELISER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERNLANDS WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0010 ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATTI ILU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE EMPERORS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA
4198-61336-0012 ITS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF A MIDDLE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 JEHOV THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARD HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHLIM
4198-61336-0015 THIS USURPER HELD SWAY TO SUMERIA FOR ONLY A MONTH
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MINNHEIM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0017 TIGLATH PELIZER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTHEAST
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOT PUT UPON THE SWARD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS URBATU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLAF PILLIZER RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0021 MENEHEIM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PEKAHIAH
4198-61336-0022 JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0023 HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR HER IDOLATRIES AND CRIED
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YE ME AND YE SHALL LIVE HAVE YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN A WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL
4198-61336-0025 THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES STILL PERISH
4198-61336-0026 ISRAEL WAS ALSO DEALED WITH
4198-61336-0027 HE SWEPT WITH ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0028 THE PHILISTINES AND THE ARABIANS OF THE DESERT WERE ALTOGETHER SUBDUED
4198-61336-0029 HE INVADING BABYLONIA
4198-61336-0030 UGENZIR TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITOL CAPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0000 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUC AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME TERROR
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THIS SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME THE LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BENNELLI QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR IF HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0005 I ASK NO GREATER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAVE NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FAITH TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0008 I BEGGED MY MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM I HAD EVER TAKEN IN
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GEORGIO DA CORONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0010 GIORGIO CAME FOR THEM HIS MOUTH
4294-14317-0011 I HOPE TO PROVE ON THAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LANDY WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGELLION
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FELT ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTOR'S CRAFT
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PLACE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-14317-0016 AMONG OUR ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE NEW SCULPTOR
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FROM THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN HEART I REACHED MY OWN
4294-32859-0000 WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGERLY
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS HIS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDALIN AND RHETCH'S PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BEFORE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THEIR OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS GO OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 AND THE MIDDLE SUN WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND WAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE SLEW
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDENS SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON COULD BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRINKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRILL HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN THAT DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CALLED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST REND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAS SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THIS OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US FROM YOUR OGRE'S MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILL STONES
4294-35475-0012 THE LIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DIM SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSOR AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS FREEDOM
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALLS SHOWS ME THE KEY HOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME BEFORE MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PERSON HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT SAID THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR INNOCENT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN A FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECOME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK INTO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHEL REED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT ETHELRIED HEEDED NOT HER TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE KING PRINCE ISOULT
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF A GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST REQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO THE BAT LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AS HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED ME
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HELP THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THIS FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE PROFESSIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS WORDS OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON ELBOWED ME ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND DRINK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID KURFEYRAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT SAY
4294-9934-0014 AND SILVER GOLD HERE IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOT
4294-9934-0016 THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT GREAT WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU KNOW GERMAN NOR
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT WE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FORWARD
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR A CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S
4294-9934-0022 YOU BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HELLO I HAD FORGOTTEN IT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL THAT HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIOUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A STONE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX THOUSAND FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE FORTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE POUNDS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD WOMAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE SEEMED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST HER
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCIPAL TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WHY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASE THE MISSUS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THIS FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALUTRATION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATION OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO OBTAIN NUTRITION
4350-10919-0009 YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THINGS RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKI BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHOULD I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON
4350-10919-0011 HE SAYS AH IT IS
4350-10919-0012 OH WELL THEN YOU CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 BUT HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS NEEDED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH FOR LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0015 THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE A CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN HIS MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM KNOW ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 OH TIME'S UP ALREADY AS HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NOW ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM OF KITTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DAUGHTER CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ANSWERED HIM THEN ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DOCTOR AND THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THIS SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID TAKE OFFENCE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER HE HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS SIMPLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY BE ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT THEIR FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT APPEARED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND HARRY PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARFUL
4350-9170-0000 THE EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-9170-0001 HE IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL PERCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTEREST OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCES BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY THE MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS ABOUT VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF SUPPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGULAR WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE FAMILY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS UPON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT MIGHT NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD HIS SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN AND POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED UPON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESIST SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMED STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THIS STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE SIDE BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTIONS OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS EVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTING INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THAT GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GET WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDUCT OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 SUCH IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THAT SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTONS MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POLES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TODAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND HIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON EVERY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY ON ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIVE YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE OF THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF HER GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS GAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN NORMAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MEN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTIES OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE OTHER INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF SLAVERY WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE'S LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS A MANIFESTATION OF A CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES WERE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PERSONALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING YOU
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE AND FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE I SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER FOR THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER YET
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THIS STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURY AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS SHOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH THEIR ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBOURS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER IN SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THAT STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT INCAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES ON BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE IN DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAY YO KNOW SOMETHING
4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CARJACK OF SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 KNOW WHO NEEDS A JOB MAN THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS
4852-28311-0003 OKA HE SAID
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASKED HIM YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT TO EMS STREET
4852-28311-0006 WELL HE ADMITTED I DID IT
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ANSWERED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 SEE HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED IN TO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT PHILIP WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BITCH AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED INTO HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE QUARTERS
4852-28311-0013 ARE SHUCKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISS WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT SHUT IN INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK OF A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ONTO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEHIND THE FACTORIES AND GREY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWN CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND ANYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THAT HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WAS THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT A COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTRE THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREAT GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THAT MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF THAT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SEND
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARHORN AWOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORING OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOME ONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY AND UNEASILY ROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH A ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0003 HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED HIM FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0004 MISTER BICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLE CHAINS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND KEPT CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0007 CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN HERE THEY WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0008 PETER SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
4852-28312-0009 YES SIR YOU SAID
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR MIND AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0011 IT'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE
4852-28312-0012 JEKIE HARRIS'S NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE BLAZE WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL BUT THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOUR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVE FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIEG'S GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALTUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARDS THE THAPHIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018 THE WOMAN SEEMED OVERLY STILL
4852-28312-0019 THEN IN THAT SECOND THEY TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28312-0020 THE WIDE BAY WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHERE IS THIS FREEWAY
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SNOW STACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023 THE WARESHOUSES WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT SHE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMP LIT THE STREETS
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD AND HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
4852-28312-0027 THE COURTYARD WAS SPARELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING THE SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW THE BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0029 A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAMING COURTYARD
4852-28312-0030 WE MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
4852-28312-0031 MY CANDLE HAS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28319-0000 THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WERE BY NO MEANS EASY
4852-28319-0001 HE TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSTLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACE FOR IT
4852-28319-0002 CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF IN ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOLT WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHOULD ALLAN DO FIRST
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY THAT THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND I CAN'T CHANGE BACK
4852-28319-0007 MISTER WORKERS WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0008 THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHISTLE MISTER RIGGER SAID START AT ONCE
4852-28319-0009 THE SENSATION IS SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE VIOLENT WORDS
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT MUCH BY
4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR POINT ONE THE RETURN
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURES SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE AND CURVED UP POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0014 THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO HARRY
4852-28319-0015 IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIVE
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE THE IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0017 BUT HOW DID ONE RETURN INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
4852-28319-0018 RUTH GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY IT RESUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARDS AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE INCREASED IN STORMS
4852-28319-0021 JUST CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY
4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS HAD TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME
4852-28319-0023 MISTER WORKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKED AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCION FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD RAISED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
4852-28319-0025 IT WAS AS IF THE BLACKNESS MELTED
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES THE WIDEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND O THE FACE
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED TO LET THE BOUQUET FALL
4852-28330-0000 THEY WENT UP TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED IN THE HELM BY ALBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
4852-28330-0004 THE MIRRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHITI
4852-28330-0005 WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE OVER THERE
4852-28330-0006 SMITH LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0007 CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEENER AND PENETRATING
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINNEER WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE MOVED WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT ME FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DID
4852-28330-0012 THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILIES
4852-28330-0013 HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT PRINCE STANDING BEFORE HIM
4852-28330-0014 WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU ASK
4852-28330-0015 THE SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WOULD BE IN YOUR HANDS
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I WOULD NOT TRY SIR
4852-28330-0017 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE GREASED IN ITS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0018 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE FACE WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0019 CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTAND
4852-28330-0020 WHAT WOULD BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS OUGHT TO ASK
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP AND CREW KNOW IT
4852-28330-0022 I MUST SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WICKER AND CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTION BE ACCOUNTED FOR
4852-28330-0025 HIS CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
533-1066-0000 WHERE CHURCHYARDS YAN
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
533-1066-0002 I AM SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
533-1066-0003 UNFORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL IN THE LODGE
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOSTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0005 MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO INTO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TO NIGHT
533-1066-0006 I HAD NONE I SAID HAPPILY
533-1066-0007 I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING REALLY UNUSUAL
533-1066-0008 THE MOST UNUSUAL THING YOU CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT
533-1066-0009 EVERYTHING IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID
533-1066-0010 PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OTHER DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
533-1066-0011 LIDLY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
533-1066-0012 THEY WERE TALKING COFIOLENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
533-1066-0013 THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE WALKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0014 I ASKS NO QUESTIONS
533-1066-0015 ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STUART WHERE HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE
533-1066-0016 I HARDLY KNOW WHAT YOU EXPECTED
533-1066-0017 A DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT
533-1066-0018 I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A TERRIBLE SPOT
533-1066-0019 IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH DOWN SHARPLY
533-1066-0020 IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLES SPADES
533-1066-0021 THE DOCTORS KEPT A KEEN LOOK OUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED
533-1066-0022 THERE'S ONE THING SURELY I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY
533-1066-0023 A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT TIDDING THEM UP
533-1066-0024 I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED
533-131556-0000 BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THAT TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY GO
533-131556-0001 FOR NONE COULD ENJOY ME AS HE HAS DONE OH
533-131556-0002 THE WAY STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUBJECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
533-131556-0004 I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD THEM VERY MINUTELY
533-131556-0005 THEY HAD OVERTAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECIATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK
533-131556-0006 I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCES OF IT
533-131556-0007 UPON PERUSING THIS HE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP
533-131556-0008 YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND SHE'LL FOLLOW IN THE WHILE MILICENT WENT
533-131556-0009 WILL WILL OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE
533-131556-0010 EH YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS
533-131556-0011 IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I RETURNED I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE
533-131556-0012 I ENJOY A MOONLAND RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND SHRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RESORTS
533-131556-0013 SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGERS AGAINST HER CHEEK AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
533-131556-0014 I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF HE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
533-131556-0015 YES WELL
533-131556-0016 SUPPOSE I DO THAT
533-131556-0017 HE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW
533-131556-0018 I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN MY LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
533-131556-0019 IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL BETTER TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR ADEPTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
533-131556-0020 I SHALL NOT KILL HIM
533-131556-0021 GIVE ME NO THANKS IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I OFFEND
533-131556-0022 AND MILICENT WILL HE TELL HER
533-131556-0023 I WOULD NOT FOR LONG THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF HER RELATION
533-131556-0024 YOU USED ODD WORDS MISSUS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU
533-131556-0025 HOW DARE YOU MENTION HIS NAME FOR ME
533-131562-0000 IT SEEMED VERY INTERESTING LOVE SAID HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO WHERE I STOOD WRINGING MY HANDS IN SILENT RAGE AND ANGUISH BUT IT'S RATHER LONG I'LL LOOK AT IT SOME OTHER TIME AND MEANWHILE I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KISS MY DEAR WHAT KISS
533-131562-0001 THE KEYS IN YOUR CABINET DESK DRAWER AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
533-131562-0002 THE KEY OF MY VEST IN FACT WAS AT THIS MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
533-131562-0003 AND NOW THEN SNEERED HE WE MUST HAVE A CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY
533-131562-0004 AND PUTTING THE KEYS INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO HIS LIBRARY
533-131562-0005 WHAT AND ALL REPLIED THE MASTER AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
533-131562-0006 MISTER HUNTINGDON THEN WENT UP THE STAIRS
533-131562-0007 MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE'S VERY DEVIL FOR THE SPITE
533-131562-0008 I DIDN'T SAY I'D FORGOTTEN IT DID I RETURNED HE
533-131562-0009 I SHALL PUT YOU UP ON A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE FOR YOUR OWN PRIVATE EXPENSES AND YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ANY MORE ABOUT MY CONCERNS I SHALL LOOK OUT FOR A STEWARD MY DEAR I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO THE TEMPTATIONS
533-131562-0010 AND AS FOR HER HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREEBS MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO UP ON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN
533-131562-0011 WHAT GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE YE MADE NOW MISTER HUNTINGDON
533-131562-0012 HAVE I INTEND TO DEFRAUD YOU
533-131562-0013 NOT THE MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS BUT IT'S BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
533-131562-0014 HERE BENSON ENTERED THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENTLY TRIUMPHING INTO MY DESPAIR
533-131562-0015 I KNOW THAT DAY AFTER DAY SUCH FEELINGS DO RETURN UPON ME
533-131562-0016 I TRY TO LOOK TO THEM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT IT WILL CLEAVE TO THE DUST
533-131564-0000 VAIN THOUGHTS I FEAR

533-131564-0002 NO UNLESS YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT HIM AT HOME
533-131564-0003 I CAN'T YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM DO YOU
533-131564-0004 IT IS THE RESOLUTION YOU HAD FORMED LONG AGO
533-131564-0005 WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF A LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS BUT WE CAN'T RESPECT HIM

533-131564-0018 THE FARMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMSBY AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENUOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON THE OTHER MAN'S SHOULDERS

533-131564-0027 AFTER THAT THEY WILL REPAIRED TO THEIR COUNTRY HOME
5442-32873-0000 CAPTAIN LAKE DO NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE A LONDON DANDIE NOW
5442-32873-0001 THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION HERE AND A WILD LURE IN HIS YELLOW EYES RACHEL SAT DOWN
5442-32873-0002 A SLAVE ONLY THANK A SLAVE
5442-32873-0003 OH FRIGHTFUL DREADFUL IS IT A DREAM
5442-32873-0004 AH FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL
5442-32873-0005 STANLEY STANLEY IT WOULD BE A MERCY TO KILL ME SHE BROKE OFF AGAIN
5442-32873-0006 BRIGHT AND GNATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH HIS BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF HER SAGE HER PILLOW SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
5442-32873-0007 WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TORLOT BOTTLE OF EAU COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH A LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
5442-32873-0008 THERE WAS NOTHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE CONVERSATION
5442-32873-0009 THEY DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM
5442-32873-0010 AND SHE THREW BACK THE VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS
5442-32873-0011 RACHAEL LEAKS RACHEL LAKE WHAT ARE YOU NOW
5442-32873-0012 I'LL STAY HERE THAT IS IN THAT DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-32873-0013 HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGONT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0014 LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKIN'S DOG AND GROOMED MISTER WILDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOLL CART FOR MIKE BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOLL CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
5442-32873-0015 BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LINE WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARDS THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGDOM
5442-32873-0016 HERE WERE THE FLOW OF SORROW AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELLED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
5442-32873-0017 LOSE NO TIME AND I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A TRUMB
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STUCK UP HIS GREASY WIDE AWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOLL CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I COULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TAMAR
5442-41168-0000 THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IT MUST BE A BALLOT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH THIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY POOR SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO ASK FOR OTTO A BALLOT
5442-41168-0004 I SHED OUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF A MARSHAL HE'S NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 VOTES PLEASE BIZIN
5442-41168-0007 THEY HAD EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOUT FLERA SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SERDYA IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLOROFF'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE PLEASANT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT CAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAY WISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED A SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JURED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT YOU
5442-41168-0014 SOYA IVANOVITCH FROWNED
5442-41168-0015 THAT WAS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN DECISION HE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND OVER AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0017 A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION TWENTY EIGHT AGAINST
5442-41168-0018 RANG OFF THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
5442-41168-0019 THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO KNOTS IN THE BOX
5442-41168-0020 BUT THE OTHER PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERED
5442-41168-0021 IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWENTY YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT A TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN YOU LET THEM SERVE
5442-41168-0024 AND THIS MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
5442-41168-0025 HE WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTION
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF KNETKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT FLEROS TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMAN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OLD FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID
5442-41169-0002 YOU'S SUCH A BLACKGUARD
5442-41169-0003 I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINKS OF IT
5442-41169-0004 THESE PERSONS WAS UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY THE FINE CHAMPAGNE
5442-41169-0006 LAST YEAR AT OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAI IVANOVITCH'S
5442-41169-0007 OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY IN CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
5442-41169-0008 WHY WHAT IS THIS TO UNDERSTAND
5442-41169-0009 BUT THERE IS NO MEANING IN IT AT ALL
5442-41169-0010 THEN TOO ONE MUST KEEP OUT CONNECTIONS
5442-41169-0011 IT'S A MERE OBLIGATION OF A SORT
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE'S ONE'S OWN
5442-41169-0013 THEY ARE PROPRIETORS OF HER SOD BUT WE ARE THE LANDOWNERS
5442-41169-0014 THAT IS MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE THE TREE THAT STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND HOW IS YOUR LAND GOING
5442-41169-0017 BUT ONE'S WORK IS THROWN AWAY FOR NOTHING
5442-41169-0018 OH WELL THAT DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0019 AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE GROUND AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO GIVE IT UP AND YET ONE DOES IT
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASLOVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN AN LIME TREE
5442-41169-0023 HERE YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BARCH
5442-41169-0024 THEY'RE MARRIED I HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER
5442-41169-0025 YES IT'S A RATHER STRANGE HE WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THE LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS GREY MOUSTACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR PEGS FOR TIMBER
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVINE RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THAT'S A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES THE GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A RETURN TO ADD A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FROM THE PATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HERMANN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANNER
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLIER HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS ARGUMENT
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAYS PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HIM
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTHYLUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARISET IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECT TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE PAID TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMANN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATIUS IN A PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENIO
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO THE NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELT CHILLED AMONGST THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICHKO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENAU'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSCHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIES HARMON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES IN TIRING WOMEN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISED ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMINTUS THE LIEGE CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLIS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE YOUNG PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSINUS IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT HIM WAITING FROM THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON ME HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THATS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMANN
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENAU HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF THE BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED A STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HERMID LISTENED TO THE PAIR IN SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENAU ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRETEZ HERMANN'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMEANOUR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THEIR FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE GOD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAD WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMANN'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TOLD YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WAS STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTIONS AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNAS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND THOUGH YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMANN PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISONS NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S ROCK
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO ART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN DEATH AS A BOOM FROM THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0005 WOULD IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FIGHT
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED THROUGH ANNIHILATION HE HERMANN WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AND ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTIUS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO HE WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24318-0010 AND YET IT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE SUBDUED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT A UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH HONEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERMANN IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 AND TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPA SILENCED HER WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE HONOR OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESIST THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT WITH GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALASTER OF THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAVE KNOWN YOU ALWAYS
5484-24318-0021 DAPHNE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS WANTED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMANN WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO HER I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORK OF MYRTLUS
5484-24318-0024 THAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU
5484-24318-0025 AND I THE FOOL BLINDED ALSO IN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE TO CONCEAL AND PALLIATE NOTHING
5484-24318-0027 SO ORACIUS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE FELT ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMINTES THE RHOODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE SUBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROPPLED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEDING FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE THIS TRUTH ITS JUST DUE
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM AROUND THE ARENA HERMANN
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATULIS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HERIMON
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PHRASE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOR TO MYRTELUS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THE NOBLE FEASTAL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARDS IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMBS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THIS GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST
5764-299665-0001 WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND MY SELF
5764-299665-0002 WHETHER ANY PRAYER HAS EVER ANSWERED
5764-299665-0003 WHY DID HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUAL INFERIORS
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL AND IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0005 OUR FAILURES UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0006 WAS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH HER LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOWED FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0008 IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THAT THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0009 DID THIS GOD LIKE THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0010 DID HE ALLOO TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0011 CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS HANDS
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT CONVORE HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHOSE LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NOSE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
5764-299665-0015 FEAR BUILDS HER ALTAR AND OFFERS THE SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0016 FEAR ERECTS THE CATHEDRALS AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0017 LIPS DELICIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0018 CAN YE SAY THAT HE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
5764-299665-0019 CAN WE SAY THAT THIS MERCY ENDURED FOREVER
5764-299665-0020 DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAD OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0021 WAS THERE GOODNESS WAS THEIR WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0022 OUGHT THE SUPERIOR RACE TO THANK GOD THAT WE ARE NOT THE INFERIOR
5764-299665-0023 SO MOST PEOPLE CLING TO THE SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0024 IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE IN ANOTHER
5764-299665-0025 IT IS THIS POWER
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NATURALLY ADVANCES THROUGH EXPERIENCE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COMES UP TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0028 HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD HE KNOWS THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPED IT WITH HER DIMPLED HAND
5764-299665-0030 THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TAUGHT THE CHILD A LESSON
5764-299665-0031 THIS IS A RESULT
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT HIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0033 WE LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES AS TRIBES AND NATIONS
5764-299665-0034 THEY HAVE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
5764-299665-0035 THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD WHICH IS TO SAY AS MORAL
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OF A NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MEMBERS
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAD SAID CONSCIENCES BORN OF LOVE
5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THE MOST REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0039 THE IMAGINATION IS CONSTITUTED
5764-299665-0040 A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE CASE OF ANOTHER
5764-299665-0041 MY SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
5764-299665-0042 MAN JUDGE OF HIMSELF
5764-299665-0043 IN ALL OF THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0044 MAN HAS ACHIEVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HES CHRISTIANITY DAN GOULD
5764-299665-0046 WHERE THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL WERE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS RELIGIONS DONE FOR HUNGARY OR AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE CENTURIES HAVE BEEN WORTH WITHOUT RELIGION
5764-299665-0049 COULD SHE HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0050 WHAT DID CHRISTIAN DO FOR THEM
5764-299665-0051 AND THEY HATED PLEASURE
5764-299665-0052 THEY MUFFLING ALL THE BELLS OF GLADNESS
5764-299665-0053 THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS ONE UNADULTERATED CURSE
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRIMINAL AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF THIS BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN HAD RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THIS CATHOLIC SPIRIT
5764-299665-0058 IS THE BIBLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES IT HAS FAILED
5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE TO INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
5764-299665-0061 RELIGION HAS NEVER MADE ONE FREE
5764-299665-0062 IT HAS NOT MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
5764-299665-0063 ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NARROW HONEST THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0064 CAN WE CURE DISEASE BY THE SUPPLICATION
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR SORROW AS ALMS
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER SHALL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT HIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE FOUND THE STONES
5764-299665-0068 THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A BASTION
5764-299665-0069 IF WE BURN WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM
5764-299665-0070 I HAD A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER STONES
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST STAGE IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNERSTONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM AN END TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED AND THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN BACK OF THE MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0075 I SAY WHAT I KNOW
5764-299665-0076 AND EVERY EVENT HAS PARENTS
5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HAS NEVER HAPPENED COULD NOT
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHAINED RIS AND THE CAM BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
5764-299665-0079 WE NOW KNOW THAT MY FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0080 WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAD BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE PLACES THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELLED
5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS TO ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE THE REFORMERS LIVED
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND UPON THE LORD UPON LUCK AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATHE THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0087 FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF THE NATURE WHY
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PRODUCED IT WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
5764-299665-0089 MUST THE GIRL FOREVER REMAIN THE VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE A BURDEN AND CURSES I
5764-299665-0091 FASHION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEAF
5764-299665-0092 LAW COULD PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
5764-299665-0093 THESE CANNOT BE DONE BY TALK OR EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0094 THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF MY WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0095 THIS FREES EVERYONE
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME WILL BE CHILD
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE HAUNTS AND BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE
6070-63485-0000 THERE DONEFAR SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOW KEY TO THE CHOUETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE
6070-63485-0001 THE THREE MONSTERS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSES
6070-63485-0002 BY MEANS OF THIS STRATAGEM THEY FOLLOWED SO CLOSELY THAT ALTHOUGH WITHIN A FEW STEPS OF SARAH AND THOMAS THEY DID NOT HEAR THEM
6070-63485-0003 SARAH AND HER BROTHER HAVING AGAIN PASSED BY THE TUPPY FRANC ARRIVED CLOSE TO THE DILAPIDATED HOUSE WHICH WAS PARTLY IN RUINS AND ITS ORGAN CELLARS FORMED A KIND OF GULF ALONG WHICH THE STREET RAN IN THAT DIRECTION
6070-63485-0004 IN AN INSTANT THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH A LEAP RESEMBLING IN STRENGTH AND AGILITY THE SPRING OF A TIGER SEIZED SATAN WITH ONE HAND BY THE THROAT AND EXCLAIMED YOUR MIND OR I WILL FLING YOU INTO THIS HOLE
6070-63485-0005 NO SAID THE OLD BRUTE GRUMBLINGLY NO NOT ONE SINGLE WHAT A SHAME
6070-63485-0006 TOM SEYTON DID NOT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND DURING THAT SCENE RAPIDLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AS IT HAD OCCURRED
6070-63485-0007 Y AH TO LAY A TRAP TO CATCH US REPLIED THE THIEF
6070-63485-0008 THEN ADDRESSING THOMAS SEYN YOU KNOW THE PLAN OF SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0009 DID YOU SEE IN THE CABARET WE HAVE JUST LEFT BUT I KNOW YOU AGAIN THE MAN WHOM THE CHARCOAL MAN CAME TO SEEK
6070-63485-0010 CRIED THE SCHOOLMASTER A THOUSAND FRANCS AND I'LL KILL IT
6070-63485-0011 WRETCH I DO NOT SPEAK HIS LIFE REPLIED SARAH TO THE SCHOOLMASTER
6070-63485-0012 LET'S GO AND MARRY HIM
6070-63485-0013 ALL BY THAT WILL BE FOR LOOKING AFTER
6070-63485-0014 WELL MY WIFE SHALL BE HERE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER YOU WILL TELL HER WHAT YOU WANT AND I SHALL SEE
6070-63485-0015 AT THE PLAIN OF SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0016 BETWEEN SAINT OIN AND THE ROAD OF LA RIVALT AT THE END OF THE ROAD AGREED
6070-63485-0017 SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS OF THE SELF STYLED FAN PAINTER
6070-63485-0018 THE FIEACA STARTED
6070-86744-0000 FRANZ WHO SEEMED ATTRACTED BY SOME INVISIBLE INFLUENCE AGAINST THE COUNT IN WHICH TERROR WAS STRANGELY MINGLED FELT AN EXTREME RELUCTANCE TO PERMIT HIS FRIEND TO BE EXPOSED ALONE TO THE SINGULAR FASCINATION THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE SEEMED TO EXERCISE OVER HIM AND THEREFORE MADE NO OBJECTION TO ALBERT'S REQUEST BUT AT ONCE ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DESIRED SPOT AND AFTER A SHORT DELAY THE COUNT JOINED THEM IN THE SALON
6070-86744-0001 MY VERY GOOD FRIEND AN EXCELLENT TEACHER REPLIED THE COUNT WITH A SMILE YOU REALLY EXAGGERATE MY TRIFLING EXERTIONS
6070-86744-0002 MY FATHER THE COMTE DE MORCERF ALTHOUGH OF SPANISH ORIGIN POSSESSES CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE BOTH AT THE COURT OF FRANCE AND MADRID AND I UNHESITATINGLY PLACE THE BEST SERVICES OF HIMSELF AND ALL TO WHOM MY LIFE IS DEAR AT YOUR DISPOSAL

6070-86744-0009 THAT DEPENDS WHEN DO WE LEAVE
6070-86744-0010 FOR FRANCE NO OF VENICE I SHALL REMAIN IN ITALY FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO

6070-86744-0013 WELL SINCE YOU MUST PART SAID THE COUNT HOLDING OUT A HAND TO EACH OF THE YOUNG MEN ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU BOTH A SAFE AND PLEASANT JOURNEY
6070-86744-0014 WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED ALBERT OF FRANCE WHEN THEY HAD RETURNED INTO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS YOU SEEM MORE THAN COMMONLY THOUGHTFUL
6070-86744-0015 I WILL CONFESS TO YOU ROBERT REPLIED FRANZ THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0016 DID YOU EVER MEET HIM PREVIOUSLY TO COME HITHER
6070-86744-0017 UPON YOUR HONOUR THEN LISTEN TO ME
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY ON THE A ALMOST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAM AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YACHT SEEN IN THE DISTANT HORIZON DRIVING UNDER FULL SAIL TOWARD PORTO VECCHIO
6070-86744-0019 THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATIONS OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86744-0020 BUT SAID PSMITH THE CORSICAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSEL
6070-86744-0021 WHY YES THE THING SEEMS TO ME SIMPLE ENOUGH
6070-86744-0022 TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DOES HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT WERE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELLOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINGURED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY
6070-86744-0023 CERTAINLY THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IN THIS PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANSWERED
6070-86744-0024 MY DEAR FRANTZ REPLIED ALBERT WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY SON ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO DELIVER HIM
6070-86744-0025 WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT ARE HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY IS HE A NATIVE
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESS HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE IMMEDIATELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SENOR VAMPA WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASE AND UNCONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS ARE ALL ON ALBERT'S SIDE
6070-86744-0028 WELL SAID FRANZ WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT FOR YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND YOUR POWERS OF REFUTATION
6070-86744-0029 AND THEN MY DEAR FRANZ LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
6070-86745-0000 THEN SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL KEY SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THEIR GARDEN AND COURT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0002 AT A QUARTER TO TEN A VALET ENTERED HE COMPOSED WITH A LITTLE GROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE CAPTAIN'S CHASSEUR ALSO
6070-86745-0003 WAIT THEN DURING THE DAY TOLD ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISHED
6070-86745-0004 VERY WELL ON HALF PAST TEN
6070-86745-0005 IS THE COUNTESS HERE YET
6070-86745-0006 THE VALET LEFT HIS ROOM
6070-86745-0007 GOOD MORNING LUCIEN GOOD EVENING SAID ALBERT YOUR PUNCTUALITY REALLY ALARMS ME
6070-86745-0008 YOU WHOM I EXPECTED LAST DO YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIXED WAS HALF PAST
6070-86745-0009 NO NO MY POOR FELLOW DO NOT CONFOUND OUR PLANS
6070-86745-0010 YES HE HAS SO MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGES IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTH
6070-86745-0011 THAT IS FOR THAT REASON YOU SEE ME SO EARLY
6070-86745-0012 I WENT HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO HAVE A RIDE FOR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 PESTIS I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT YOU WOULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE
6070-86745-0014 BESIDES THAT DOES NOT CONCERN THE HOME BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENTS
6070-86745-0015 AT WHAT ABOUT THE PAPERS
6070-86745-0016 IN THE ENTIRE MILITARY WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING TOO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE
6070-86745-0018 COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCELLA
6070-86745-0019 WITH YOUR TALENTS YOU MAY MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM OUR TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
6128-63240-0001 THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNGER MAN
6128-63240-0002 SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THEM
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORK ADAY ASPECT
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN WOULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH MERELY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MUST HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS PENSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD
6128-63240-0009 AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY HIS SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPAUS AND ROARING RADICALS
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH WONDER
6128-63240-0012 HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUNKER WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6128-63240-0013 SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE DAUGHTER
6128-63240-0014 HAVE YOU BEEN IN EGYPT
6128-63240-0015 NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE WHERE
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES IT AS SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LENO
6128-63240-0018 ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS THOUGH YOU WERE
6128-63240-0019 AND MISTER LENA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0020 ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD TO COME BACK FOR
6128-63240-0021 BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BUSTON AND DID N'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0022 THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY PAINS
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RAMSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LULEY'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PRESSED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO THE THEATRE PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINED SO EARLY
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LUCNEY'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSLOW THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BE OTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUN'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002 RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF A REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE CAN HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEATH
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH THIRTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTERS WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASSERTING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0009 OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF HEARING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ERECTED IT UPON A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER WHO WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0012 HE WAS TOO SMALL TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BAZIER RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF HAS THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THIS VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE LADIES ON BEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT THEIR BALLOT
6128-63244-0002 PERHAPS SHE SHOULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF MORE OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
6128-63244-0004 OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WERE A PROOFS OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0005 ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FAWENDER WHO LIVED AT RUXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINGERS SUPPOSED BUT THEN THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0007 AS SHE WISHED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE
6128-63244-0008 THIS WOULD SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0009 CHARLIE WAS A YOUNG MAN WITH A WIDE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH THE MOST
6128-63244-0010 OLIVE NATURALLY WONDERED HOW MISSUS SPARRINGER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
6128-63244-0011 IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKINGS
6128-63244-0012 MY MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
6128-63244-0013 RAISE THE STANDARDS AMONG THEM AND BRING ME YOUR THOUSAND NAMES
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE PICK CURRANTS MISSUS FARRENDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0015 SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE THAT SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSION OF RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0016 AND I WANT TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREATER REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THEIR SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
6128-63244-0018 THE UNHAPPINESS OF MANKIND
6128-63244-0019 THEY WERE HER SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THEIR DELIVERING HAD DAWNED
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT THE JUST REVOLUTION IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE MORTAL BLOOD STAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0021 THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMAN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF A SUNRISE MIST OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY IS SUCCESS
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BIRD'S EYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEMED ALREADY A MARTYR
6128-63244-0024 OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG UNREWARDED WEARY LIFE A THOUGHT OR AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSIONS OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
6432-63722-0000 BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YOU FIGURE ON DOIN SOME DETECTING AND GIVEIN UP FISHIN
6432-63722-0001 AND CRAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
6432-63722-0002 I AM GOIN OFF FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING AND MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
6432-63722-0003 GET READY SHAG YASSEH COLONEL
6432-63722-0004 AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HAD HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN CONNEXION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
6432-63722-0005 PINKUS AND DONOVAN HAVEN'T THEY CARROLL YER UP
6432-63722-0006 CAROL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLACK SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
6432-63722-0007 ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON THAT PLACE COLONEL
6432-63722-0008 BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH THIS COLONEL THAN THAT CAT
6432-63722-0009 PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED COLONEL ASHLING
6432-63722-0010 WE'VE GOT OUR MEN AND THAT IS ALL WE WANT
6432-63722-0011 YOU'RE ON THE DANCING CASE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YES
6432-63722-0012 I'M GOING IN THE INTEREST OF THE YOUNG MAN
6432-63722-0013 IT'S JEST ONE O EM COINCIDENCES LIKE
6432-63722-0014 BUSTED HIS HEAD IN WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE A PAIR
6432-63722-0015 GADE EXPLAINED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0016 THE VERY PAIRS I WAS GOING TO BUY
6432-63722-0017 LOOK HERE COLONEL DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
6432-63722-0018 AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE CALM ANSWER
6432-63722-0019 I HAPPEN TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGA PHUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63722-0020 OH I'M AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
6432-63722-0021 THUTE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED SHER ALI
6432-63722-0022 ANYHOW HE AND RUD DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL IT SEEMS
6432-63722-0023 NEIGHBORS OFTEN HEARD US SCRAPPING A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
6432-63722-0024 TOWARD DARK A MAN WENT IN TO BUY A HAM
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND THIS HEAVY CANDLE STICK NEAR IT
6432-63722-0026 SURE HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD GET IT OUT
6432-63722-0027 MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH BUT THE DAGOES TALKED IN THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0028 AND THE WATCH HAVE YE IT YES IT'S HERE

6432-63722-0031 AND DONALMOND'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SCEPTICAL
6432-63722-0032 YES IT MUST HAVE SOME ROUGH EDGES ON IT
6432-63722-0033 AND I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGERS I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
6432-63722-0034 IF HE DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THIS A BIT
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE GENERAL
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASSES OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE AND POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL
6432-63722-0038 AND DONOVAN TAKES A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
6432-63722-0039 ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE JUST

6432-63722-0046 WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF CUTTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0047 RATHER AN HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION
6432-63722-0048 AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCRATCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0049 AND YOU I DON'T WANT HIM EITHER
6432-63722-0050 BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NO I KNOW

6432-63722-0059 AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULD N'T KNOW
6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOKS
6432-63723-0001 BUT WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW

6432-63723-0007 IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED A REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THATS WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0009 THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT NEWS TO HIM
6432-63723-0010 AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS AS UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED
6432-63723-0011 HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012 SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AS SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0013 WHY LARCH MADE NO DEFENCE
6432-63723-0014 LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRIVATELY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COUNT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNCIL FEE
6432-63723-0016 NO BUT HE WILL FOR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0017 AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSON TO MAKE IT UP
6432-63723-0018 LITTLE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT COULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELLER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0020 IT HAD A DUE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALL ROOMS AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
6432-63723-0022 LARCH HIMSELF WAS A SINGULAR CHARACTER
6432-63723-0023 AT A SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
6432-63723-0024 AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH AS WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RACHFORD HAD MARRIED
6432-63723-0025 TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHO WHISPERED MONEY
6432-63723-0026 AND IN A WAY IT WAS
6432-63723-0027 SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OUT DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
6432-63723-0028 AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECOME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
6432-63723-0029 THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY AND HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
6432-63723-0030 BUT IT IS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
6432-63723-0031 IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED THE COLONEL
6432-63723-0032 MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING TO BE DONE ALWAYS RETURN THE ANSWER
6432-63723-0033 DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME UP ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0034 I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM IT WILL TAKE TIME
6432-63723-0035 THAT'S HARD FOR MISS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP LIKE A MAJOR
6432-63723-0036 SO KING GOT BAIL WE PUT IT UP
6432-63723-0037 IT WAS HIGH IN LARCH
6432-63723-0038 THEY PUT HARRY AWAY A WHILE AGO
6432-63723-0039 BUT HIS ARE PRETTY UNCERTAIN SHOES BE IN JUST THE SAME
6432-63723-0040 ONLY THAT I HAVE DARCY HESITATED AND GREW RED
6432-63723-0041 GOOD EVENING COLONEL HE CALLED GENIALLY WILL YOU JOIN ME IN A WELSH HABIT
6432-63723-0042 THANK YOU NOR
6432-63723-0043 I'M AFRAID MY DIGESTION ISN'T QUITE UP TO THAT AS I'VE HAD TO CUT OUT MY FISHING IN LATE
6432-63723-0044 NOW AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE STORES ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER
6432-63723-0045 THE STOPPED CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU NO THEORY
6432-63723-0046 THERE ARE THREE OF THEM THE CENTRE FIGURE BEING THAT OF HARRY KING AND HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOXICATED
6432-63723-0047 THAT IS NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMEHOW IT HAPPENED TO BE SO NOW
6432-63723-0048 I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTURED TONES HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO USE AND YET OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE USE OF LATE

6432-63723-0050 I SAID I WAS GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY SO WITH AN EFFORT
6432-63723-0051 WHY POLONIUS SOME ONE ELSE
6432-63723-0052 BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
6432-63723-0053 THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY OF HIS POCKET
6432-63723-0054 IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAVE IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
6432-63723-0055 I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHILE I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
6432-63723-0056 THAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELERS
6432-63723-0057 NOW HARRY KING HAS THAT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY
6938-70848-0000 EVEN THE SUNLIGHT CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY AT NOON
6938-70848-0001 THE COLDS AND RHEUMATISM OF THE RAINY MONTHS ADVANCED
6938-70848-0002 ASKED A WORKER LAST SUMMER YOU DID IT WHEN THE YUNKERS
6938-70848-0003 WHERE DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US ONE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARM IN A SLING
6938-70848-0004 HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM BY THE DEATHS
6938-70848-0005 WHO ARE YOU TO DESTROY THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS LELENIN A GERMAN
6938-70848-0006 WHO ARE YOU A COUNTERWOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THE BELOVED ADAM
6938-70848-0007 YOU CALL YOURSELVES THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA BUT YOU ARE NOT THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA
6938-70848-0008 THE PIGSANTS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS
6938-70848-0009 WE KNOW WHAT THAT PEASANTS WILL SAY AREN'T THEY WORKING MEN LIKE OURSELVES
6938-70848-0010 THIS MAN ESPECIALLY WELCOMED THE CALL TO A CONGRESS OF CITIZENS
6938-70848-0011 THESE LAST WERE A YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
6938-70848-0012 WHEREUPON THE LITTLE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE LEFT THE HALL
6938-70848-0013 DOWN WITH ME THEY SHRIEKED
6938-70848-0014 FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN AT THE BOLSHEVIKI
6938-70848-0015 UPON MY RETURN I VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET SOME ONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
6938-70848-0016 MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STATUS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMISSION WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
6938-70848-0017 BY DECLINING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCES IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO BLOCK THE RE ELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LAST SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRULIAN PROGRAM OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
6938-70848-0020 THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY DID NOT DARE TO BREAK WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
6938-70848-0021 FOLLOWED HIM OLENIN LISTENED TO THAT WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
6938-70848-0022 THE FIRST AGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISTS AND THE LANDOWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE KUGHSIE RELATED
6938-70848-0023 THE UMESS AND ZAMSTOOLS WERE DROPPED
6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN CLOSED
6938-70848-0025 HE SPOKE TO THE REV CONVENTION
6938-70848-0026 THE PRIVILEGES WILL SAVE US IN THE END
6938-70848-0027 BUT THE PRESENT MOMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND IS WHY IT IS INVINCIBLE
6938-70848-0028 THE VOICE OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN THE HALL
6938-70848-0029 A NEW HUMANITY WILL BE BORN OF THAT WAR
6938-70848-0030 I GREET YOU WITH THE CHRISTENING OF THIS NEW RUSSIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM
7018-75788-0000 THEN I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH IN THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED IN HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
7018-75788-0001 BEHOLD A SHIP WAS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THEIR DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
7018-75788-0002 HEARING THIS I WAS SORE TROUBLED CONSIDERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED FROM THE APE KIND
7018-75788-0003 UPON THIS HE BOUGHT ME A COTTON BAG AND GIVING IT TO ME SAID TAKE THIS BAG AND FILL IT WITH PEBBLES FROM THE BEACH AND GO FORTH WITH THE COMPANY OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO WHOM I WILL GIVE A CHARGE RESPECTING THEE
7018-75788-0004 DO AS WE DO AND BELIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FURTHER THY RETURN VOYAGE TO THY NATIVE LAND
7018-75788-0005 THEN HE CARRIED ME TO THE BRIDGE WHERE I FILLED MY BAG WITH PEBBLES LARGE AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLK ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH BEARING A BAG LIKE MINE FILLED WITH PEBBLES
7018-75788-0006 TO THESE HE COMMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO THEIR CARE AND SAYING THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY GET HIS DAILY BREAD AND YOU WILL LEARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
7018-75788-0007 NOW SLEEPING UNDER THOSE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES WHEREUPON MY COMPANIONS BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE FOLK
7018-75788-0008 WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWNS OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
7018-75788-0009 WHEN IT WAS A FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINTH NIGHT
7018-75788-0010 AND CEASED NOT SAILING TILL WE ARRIVED SAFELY IN BUSSORAH
7018-75788-0011 THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGHDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTER AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FORGATHER WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STOREHOUSES
7018-75788-0012 AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GREATER PROFIT AND GAIN I HAD MADE
7018-75788-0013 NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING M MOHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL CREATURES BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND WISHED HIM A GOOD DAY
7018-75788-0014 HERE I FOUND A GREAT SHIP READY FOR SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD WITH THEM GOODS AND PRICE SO I EMBARKED MY BALES THEREIN
7018-75788-0015 HAPPILY AMONGST YOU IT IS ONE RIGHTEOUS WHOSE PRAYERS THE LORD WILL ACCEPT
7018-75788-0016 FINALLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE MOUNTAIN AND BROKE UP AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD OF HER WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75788-0017 BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS POWER AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE TRAVELLERS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
7018-75788-0018 EACH THAT DIED THEY WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTHES AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE TILL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT A LITTLE PROVISION LEFT I WHO WAS WONT TO HAVE SO MUCH
7018-75788-0019 BUT THERE IS MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO NIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT
7018-75789-0000 WHILE IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST NIGHT
7018-75789-0001 THEN SIGNED FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND CORMORON ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIP'S STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD MAKING ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
7018-75789-0002 LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE UPON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS A NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
7018-75789-0003 I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED THE CRAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ON KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT IN MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0005 WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STRETCH AND THE RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
7018-75789-0006 BUT I WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE ROOF
7018-75789-0007 WHEN THEY SAW I UNDERSTOOD THEM NOT AND MADE THEM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BRETHREN
7018-75789-0008 OH MY BROTHER ANSWERED HE WE ARE HUSBANDMEN AND TILLERS OF THE SOIL WHO CAME OUT TO WATER OUR FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS AND FINDING THEE ASLEEP ON THIS RAFT LAID HOLD OF IT AND MADE IT FAST BY US AGAIN THOU SHOULDEST AWAKE AT THY LEISURE
7018-75789-0009 I ANSWERED FOR ALLAH'S SAKE O MY LORD ERE I SPEAK GIVE ME SOMEWHAT TO EAT FOR I AM STARVING AND AFTER YOU ASK ME WHAT THOU WILT
7018-75789-0010 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SECOND NIGHT
7018-75789-0011 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HATH TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING THAT HE MAY ACQUAINT HIM WITH HIS ADVENTURES
7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THEIR UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0013 SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR WHAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND
7018-75789-0014 QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US ON OUR HEAD OR EYES BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST US WITH THY COMPANY

7018-75789-0016 THERE I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND OF ALL MY INTIMATES AND ACQUAINTANCES IN THE ISLAND AND EMBARKED WITH THE MERCHANTS AFORESAID
7018-75789-0017 HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NEITHER THE NAME OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER
7018-75789-0018 FOR STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND UPON THAT HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUESTS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
7018-75789-0019 HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THIS AND AS FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST A WITNESSED
7018-75789-0020 PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONGST MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRYMAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED
7018-75789-0021 SUCH NOW O MY BROTHERS IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL ME IN MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TO MORROW INSHALLAH
7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELOUS THAN THAT OF THE SIXTH
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THAT FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS IN WONT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE IN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN
7018-75789-0026 KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE IN ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH IN MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN THE SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGHDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER ARE COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLIMBED TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED ABOUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IT IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT YOU WHOSO COME HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS A SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID AND BOTH BE PEACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NAUGHT MORE DANGEROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIPS WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO PLATTERBATH'S GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALLS IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND AN EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT RISE
7105-2330-0004 A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BYE ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DONING STREET AND OTHER CENTRES
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATHLY HUSH
7105-2330-0007 THE FOREMAN DELIVERS HIS MESSAGE
7105-2330-0008 THE JURY FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBERT HALLS
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISH TO ADD A WRITER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A BI ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS IN HAND
7105-2330-0010 AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE POOR A JUNIOR CONSUL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
7105-2330-0011 FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID A PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF
7105-2330-0012 OUR MAJORITY LAST TIME IS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN
7105-2330-0013 SEVEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCES OF PRECIPITANCY
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTER AFF IS OUT BEFORE THE POLE OPENS
7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RED RAPP'S INN TO NIGHT
7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRILOUN A REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
7105-2330-0017 HE EXCLAIMED WON'T DO
7105-2330-0018 HE SAYS HE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM OUT AND HE'S NOT GOING TO BE WITHOUT ONE NOW
7105-2330-0019 SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A RELEASED PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ESTATES
7105-2330-0020 ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BRAND
7105-2330-0021 PAUL OPENS IN SEVEN MINUTES
7105-2330-0022 IS PLATDER BUFF OUT YET
7105-2330-0023 IN HEAVEN'S NAME VI
7105-2330-0024 THE CHIEF ORGANIZER HANG OFF
7105-2330-0025 THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE SURPRISED AT ONCE
7105-2330-0026 CAN'T YOU GET A STRIKE PERMIT AS THE ORGANIZER
7105-2330-0027 I'LL TRY SAID THE HOME SECRETARY AND WENT TO A TELEPHONE
7105-2330-0028 EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WE'LL VAULT THE OTHER WAY
7105-2330-0029 A TELEGRAM WAS BROUGHT DOWN
7105-2330-0030 IT WAS FROM THAT CENTRAL COMEDY ROOMS AT NEMESIS
7105-2330-0031 WITHOUT A BAND HE DID NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND
7105-2330-0032 A QUARTER PAST TEN HALF PAST EIGHT
7105-2330-0033 HAVE YOU ANY BAND INSTRUMENTS OF A EASY NATURE TO PLAY
7105-2330-0034 DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANIZER OF THE PRISON THE GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS THOSE SORT OF THINGS
7105-2330-0035 THE WARDERS HAVE THE PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THE MEN THEMSELVES
7105-2330-0036 AND LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZER
7105-2330-0037 THE POPULAR TONGUE OF THE MOMENT REPLIED THE AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT TO THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF IT DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONERS STRODE FORTH TO FREEDOM
7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF THE LAW HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0040 THE SEAT WAS PLACED AFTER ALL BY A NARROW MATURITY
7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENSE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS TRICK BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTER BATH FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
7105-2340-0000 WITH THAT NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIS HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON ONE WANTED IN ONES HOUSE
7105-2340-0001 WELL THE FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID THE HUSBAND OR ARE DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE ESTATE
7105-2340-0002 BESIDES CYNICISM UPON HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIS FAILING
7105-2340-0003 WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY NOT VERY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVE NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THE THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY
7105-2340-0004 WILFRID PIGEONCOT HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRED PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTEREFFECTS OF A POLO ACCIDENT
7105-2340-0005 A WILFRED PICHENCOTE HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONORS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRED HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK
7105-2340-0006 AND THE PROPOSITION WAS AN UNPLEASANT ONE
7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOL DAYS ONWARD HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF CLEPTYMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION
7105-2340-0008 THE SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEON COTE TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THEIR CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRED SAYING HE IS PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS
7105-2340-0009 SIGNED WILFRED PIGEONHOTE
7105-2340-0010 I SUPPOSE HE'S BRINGING US A PRESENT FOR THAT SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS
7105-2340-0011 A TALK FLITTED NERVOUSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER
7105-2340-0012 IN THAT DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER THEIR NERVOUSNESS AND AWKWARDNESS INCREASED
7105-2340-0013 OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWED YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETER SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUEST HERE THEY ALL ARE
7105-2340-0014 MUCH NICE USEFUL GIFTS A FEW DIPLICATES OF COURSE
7105-2340-0015 THE SEVEN CREAM JUGS PUT IN PETER
7105-2340-0016 WE KNOW THAT WE MUST LIVE ON CREAM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
7105-2340-0017 OF COURSE SOME OF THEM CAN BE FORMED
7105-2340-0018 I PUT IT ON BY THE CLARET JUG SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER OBJECT
7105-2340-0019 VIGILANCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY CROWNED WITH ITS SENSE OF VICTORY
7105-2340-0020 AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR VISITOR MISSUS PETER EXPRESSED HER CONVICTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN ANYTHING
7105-2340-0021 HOW ON EARTH WERE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I'M HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY ONE OFF
7105-2340-0022 IF THE ONLY THING TO DO
7105-2340-0023 WILFRID WAS LATE IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOME THING WAS AMISS
7105-2340-0024 IT'S AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKING OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU
7105-2340-0025 IT WAS A LITTLE PRESENT FROM MY FATHER AND MYSELF FOR YOUR SILVER WEDDING
7105-2340-0026 I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT FOR YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND YOU SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT RATHER AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING YOU ANOTHER
7105-2340-0027 SO SNATCHER HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THESE MANY YEARS
7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNEST IN PAGE ANDCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPAST OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
7105-2340-0029 HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED FRANKLY AND DESPERATELY AT ONE ANOTHER
7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILST WE ARE AT BREAKFAST
7105-2340-0031 SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER CARRYING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS
7105-2340-0032 THE PIEON COATS HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION
7105-2340-0033 PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
7105-2340-0034 MISSUS PETER TURNED TO HER GUEST WITH CONFIDENTIALLY COYNESS
7105-2340-0035 PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS TO TRANSCEND THE FAMILY GOOD LORD
7105-2340-0036 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A CLEPTOMANIAC LIKE COUSIN SNATCHER
7105-2340-0037 BRAVE LITTLE GENTLEMAN SAID PETER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT
7902-96591-0000 I'M AT THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST
7902-96591-0001 DON'T WORRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO COME
7902-96591-0002 AND AND THEN YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
7902-96591-0003 I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN AS MUCH TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE
7902-96591-0004 THAT MY FATHER MISTER RISDON GRAHAM HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE
7902-96591-0005 HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS I SHALL NOT TELL
7902-96591-0006 OH PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHIE WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLE ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD ESTROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 AND ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE THE ROUGH FISHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA RAPIDLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 WE'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STAND AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME FOR THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECTED AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNTIL A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE WINDOW SILL
7902-96591-0017 THE NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0018 YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THAT CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0019 NO THIS WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS ON THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN FOUR PLACES
7902-96591-0022 HE LOOKED AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE AND THE HEAD DID NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO THAT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
7902-96592-0000 SURELY YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES FATHER QUITE
7902-96592-0001 I'M GONE HOME TO BREAKFAST

7902-96592-0004 TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AN I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR AWAY TONIGHT
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHIE RAYSTROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A CLEAR DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TELE THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHY DID ANDY CALL MISTER GURRY FATHER
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE BELL WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0010 AND I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS BACK I SUPPOSE
7902-96592-0011 NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THIS SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DO THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RIDE AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONEWORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT IN THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 REDREN WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE
7902-96592-0016 HULLO HE ASKED WHO ARE YOU

7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRISONER AND SHE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE CITY PRESENTED ITSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOWS AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE STUDIED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASSAULTING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTE HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK INTO ITS SHEATH
7902-96592-0032 NO I CAN'T PART WITH THAT HA HA HA SHOUTED THE BOY JEERINGLY

7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE IS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISONVILLE SHE WENT TO WAVERLEY WHERE SHE WAS HOUNDED OCCASIONALLY

7975-280063-0004 COME IN COLONEL HAYS EXCLAIMED COLONEL COCKLE
7975-280063-0005 I THINK HE'LL BE RATHER TOUGH MEAT FOR BREAKFAST I REPLIED HE CAN BE ALL RIGHT FOR DINNER
7975-280063-0006 JACKSON WITH A PARTY OF THIRTY SEASONED MEN CHARGED THE INDIANA GUNS AND CAPTURED THEM BUT MAJOR FOSTER LED A GALLANT CHARGE AGAINST THE INVADERS AND RECAPTURED THE PIECES
7975-280063-0007 WE WERE OUT OF AMMUNITION AND WERE HELPLESS HAD THE FIGHT BEEN DESPERATE
7975-280063-0008 THEY DID MARK MY CLOTHES AT ONE OR TWO PLACES HOWEVER
7975-280063-0009 MAJOR FOSTER IN A LETTER TO JUDGE GEORGE M BENNET OF MINNEAPOLIS SAY
7975-280063-0010 I WAS TOLD BY SOME OF OUR MEN FROM THE WESTERN BORDER OF THE STATE THAT THEY RECOGNISED THE DARING YOUNG RIDER AS COAL OWNER
7975-280063-0011 ABOUT NINE THIRTY P M I WAS SHOT DOWN
7975-280063-0012 THE WOUNDED OF BOTH FORCES WERE GATHERED UP AND WERE PLACED IN THE HOUSES
7975-280076-0000 ALTHOUGH EVERY BOOK PURPORTING TO NARRATE THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS WAS TOLD OF THE LIBERTY ROBBERY AND IMPLIED THAT WE HAD A PART IN IT THE YOUNGERS WERE NOT SUSPECTED AT THE TIME NOR FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNISED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPARD REDMOCKERS AND BUD PENCE WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUANTRELLES
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAID WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BLOODSHED JUDGE MC LEAN THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FAINTLY
7975-280076-0003 NO WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNG MEN BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
7975-280076-0004 JUNE THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE OBENCOCK BROTHERS BANK AT CROYDON IOWA WAS ROBBED OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BY SEVEN MEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
7975-280076-0005 IT WAS CHARGED THAT ARTHUR MAC COY OR A C MC COY AND MYSELF HAD BEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE GAD'S HILL AFFAIR OF THE TWO STAGE ROBBERIES
7975-280076-0006 THE PARTS OF THIS STORY NOW RELEVANT ARE AS FOLLOWS
7975-280076-0007 YOU MAY GIVE THIS LETTER IN YOUR OWN WAY
7975-280076-0008 I WILL GIVE YOU THIS OUTLINE AND SKETCH OF MY WHEREABOUTS IN ACTIONS AT THE TIME OF CERTAIN ROBBERIES WITH WHICH I AM CHARGED
7975-280076-0009 AT THE TIME OF THE GALLETON BANK ROBBERING I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM PLEZ TAYLOR AND RECTOR
7975-280076-0010 THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SHERIFF BERKELEY AND FIFTY OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN IN THAT COUNTY
7975-280076-0011 I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS LET FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY
7975-280076-0012 I THEN WENT TO ARKANSAS AND RETURNED INTO SAINT CLAIR COUNTY ABOUT THE FIRST OF MAY
7975-280076-0013 I WENT TO KANSAS WHERE OUR CATTLE WERE IN WOODS COUNTY AT COLONEL RIDGES
7975-280076-0014 DURING THE SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS BUT AS THERE WAS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED THAT SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHAT I WAS
7975-280076-0015 I WENT THROUGH INDEPENDENCE AND FROM THERE TO AZ WEBBS
7975-280076-0016 THERE I TOOK DINNER AND THEN WENT TO DOCTOR L W TWMAN'S
7975-280076-0017 OUR BUSINESS THERE WAS TO SEE E P WEST HE IS NOT AT HOME BUT THE FAMILY WILL REMEMBER THAT WE WERE THERE
7975-280076-0018 WE CROSSED ON THE BRIDGE STAYED IN THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND NEXT MORNING WE RODE UP THROUGH A CITY
7975-280076-0019 I MET SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AMONG THEM WAS BOB HUDSTIETH
7975-280076-0020 WE ARE NOT ON GOOD TERMS AT THAT TIME NOR HAVE WE BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS
7975-280076-0021 POOR JOE HE HAS BEEN HUNTED DOWN AND SHOT LIKE A WILD BEAST AND NEVER WAS A BOY MORE INNOCENT
7975-280076-0022 DOCTOR L LEWINS WAS HIS PHYSICIAN
7975-280076-0023 THERE WERE FIFTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS THERE WHO WILL TESTIFY IN ANY COURT THAT JOHN AND I WAS THERE
7975-280076-0024 HELVIN FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WERE ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND BOTH OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE ABOVE FOR JOHN AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MISTER SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND WAS IN HIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MISTER AND MISS FICKLE AFTER THE SERVICE
7975-280076-0025 ABOUT THE LAST OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY THREE I ARRIVED IN CARROLL PARRISH LOUISIANA
7975-280076-0026 I STAYED THERE UNTIL THE EIGHTH OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
7975-280076-0027 I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THE TIME I WAS AT NEXIO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAY
7975-280076-0028 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY IN ADAIR IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY
7975-280084-0000 I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED HE SHOULD NOT SHOOT ANY ONE
7975-280084-0001 WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOOD BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT IN THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
7975-280084-0002 WHEN WE CAME IN I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
7975-280084-0003 J S ALLEN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO A BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
7975-280084-0004 GET YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY'VE ROBBING THE BANK
7975-280084-0005 AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT INTO THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS AT THE BRIDGE THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
7975-280084-0006 ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT IN THE DECK
7975-280084-0007 CHADWELL WOODS AND HIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
7975-280084-0008 IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SAW HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN WOODS
7975-280084-0009 MEANTIME THE STREET WAS GETTING DISCOMFORTABLY HOT
7975-280084-0010 EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRIED TO DRIVE THE SHOOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7975-280084-0011 DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE DOWN STAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
7975-280084-0012 CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED THE MILLER'S MARE
7975-280084-0013 WHAT KEPT YOU SO LONG SHE ASKED PITTS
7975-280084-0014 AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR OUTSIDE THE BANK I TAKE THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0015 WHERE'S THE MONEY OUTSIDE THE SAFE ROB ASKED
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL FITZ FACED HIM WITH A BULL
7975-280084-0017 THE FIRST ONE MISSED HIM BUT THE SECOND RAN THROUGH HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
7975-280085-0000 THAT NIGHT IT STARTED THE RAIN AND WE WORE OUT OUR HORSES
7975-280085-0001 FRIDAY WE MOVE TOWARDS WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMP BETWEEN ELYSIA AND GERMAN LAKE
7975-280085-0002 BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARM HOUSE CLOSE TO MANKATO
7975-280085-0003 THAT DAY A MAN NAMED DANNING DISCOVERED US AND WE TOOK HIM PRISONER
7975-280085-0004 FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL HE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE AGREED NOT TO
7975-280085-0005 NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POST HASTE INTO MANCADA TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
7975-280085-0006 THE WHISTLE ON THE OIL MILL FLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
7975-280085-0007 HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH IT PILLARED ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
7975-280085-0008 BUT THEY SOON AFTERWARD GOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM BROKE MY WALKING STICK WITH A SHOT
7975-280085-0009 WE WERE IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG SAWED HILLS WHEN THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE ANIMALS AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
7975-280085-0010 SIX STEPS TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T O WALT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J STEVENSON
7975-280085-0011 FORMING THE LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE OF THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ROBBERS WERE DISCOVERED
7975-280085-0012 MAKES FOR THE HORSES I SAID EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
7975-280085-0013 THERE'S NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE BUT WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHARGE THEM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN
7975-280085-0014 I GOT UP AS THE SIGNAL FOR THE CHARGE AND THEY FIRED ONE VOLLEY
7975-280085-0015 ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELLED UPON BOB IN SPITE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS A FLAG OF TRUCE
7975-280085-0016 SHERIFF GLISPTON OF WATTAWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
7975-280085-0017 INCLUDING THESE RECEIVED IN AND ON THE WAY FROM NORTHFIELD I HAD ELEVEN WOUNDS
7975-280085-0018 AND SHERIFF GLISPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTECTORATE THAT MINNESOTA PEOPLE HAD ESTABLISHED OVER US
8131-117016-0000 CAPTAIN MURDOCK I
8131-117016-0001 BUT MARSPORT HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO SELL IT OFF
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN WAR ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MEN
8131-117016-0003 A STONEWALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DARELX AND FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF A MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THAT NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS INTELLIGENT PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0007 CAPTAIN MURDOCK WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND NOW WAS ASKING FOR MORE
8131-117016-0008 THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM FOR HIM
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE MATTER FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE RELIEF
8131-117016-0010 I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY WE DO ON EARTH
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERY ONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT FOR GRAFT
8131-117016-0012 THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THAT SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THE STONE WALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
8131-117016-0013 HE PICKED OUT FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON WHO FIVE WILL COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TO NIGHT PICK ANY ROUTE THAT'S OPEN O K THERE LET'S GO
8131-117016-0015 BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCK'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH CAUGHT
8131-117016-0016 TWO YEARS GORDON HAD ADMITTED
8131-117016-0017 FOR A SECOND GORDON CURSES HIMSELF
8131-117016-0018 HE BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT SECURITY THAT
8131-117016-0019 THEY HAD TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHOD BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES TO OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE PERSON WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THE FINELY FORMED CLUB IN HIS HANDS
8131-117016-0024 GORDIN'S EYES POPPED AT THAT
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWED THE SENTIMENT HIS OWN BLOOD WAS MOVING NOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER THREE COPS HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
8131-117016-0027 HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW AGAINST THE KIDNEYS
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPPENCE STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0029 TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL THIS WAGON
8131-117016-0030 WE'RE NOT USING CHICKENS MURDOCK TOLD HIM LINE THEM UP
8131-117016-0031 IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE SHOT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED CAREFULLY
8131-117016-0032 MURDOCK INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS FINGERS SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS SICK AS GORDON'S HIMSELF
8131-117016-0034 I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU MAY REMEMBER HE TOLD THE MAN
8131-117016-0035 COLONEL THEY'D KILL ME I DON'T KNOW IT
8131-117016-0036 MURDOCK TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND TURNED TO THE WRETCHED TUFS
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL FIGHT YOU
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER SO
8131-117016-0039 MURDOCK SENT ONE OF THE MEN TO MAKE UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD
8131-117016-0040 AND THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN WHO'S BEEN BEATEN BEFORE
8131-117016-0041 GET A STRETCHER AND CARRY HIM WHEREVER HE BELONGS HE ORDERED
8131-117016-0042 BUT THE CAPTAIN STIRRED FAIRLY SIGHING
8131-117016-0043 NO THE COPSE THEY'RE GIVING ME WE'RE COVER GORDON
8131-117016-0044 BUT THE STONEWALL GANG WAS BACKING WAIN
8131-117016-0045 BUT IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH ON ME
8131-117016-0046 BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE GOT A YELLOW TICKET AS SECURITY
8131-117016-0047 MURDOCK BLINKED HE DROPPED HIS HANDS SLOWLY
8131-117016-0048 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAINS WILL BE RE ELECTED
8131-117016-0049 NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWERS
8131-117016-0050 EVER SEE A MISSION ELECTION
8131-117016-0051 NO YOU'RE A DERSTER HE CAN'T LOSE
8131-117016-0052 AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS WHOLE PLANET CAN BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WITH THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE BIG RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0055 COST OF MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE IZZARD IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE SEES IT
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEAS OF THIS STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
8131-117016-0058 THE GROUPS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCK WAS THROWNING A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
8131-117016-0059 IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING WAS DONE
8131-117016-0060 THIS COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D DONE ON EARTH
8131-117016-0061 BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT AS MAYOR WAIN WAS RE ELECTED
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHOS BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORISED PRECINCT HOUSE
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANNE HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117017-0002 AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HAYLIE'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117017-0003 GORDON HIT THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MAR'S SPEAKER LET OUT A SHRILL WHISTLE
8131-117017-0004 GUNS OFTEN SEEMED TO BE FLOURISHING EVERYWHERE
8131-117017-0005 YOU DON'T DO IT TO ME
8131-117017-0006 I M REFORMED I'M GOING STRAIGHT
8131-117017-0007 YOU DAMNED COPSE CAN'T ONIAS BLUBBERING
8131-117017-0008 ONE LOOK WAS ENOUGH THE WORK PAPERS HAD THE TELLTALE OVER THICKENING OF THE SIGNATURE THEY HAD SHOWED UP ON OTHER PAPERS OBVIOUSLY FORGERIES
8131-117017-0009 SOME TURNED AWAY AS GORDON AND THE OTHER COPP WENT TO WORK BUT MOST OF THEM WERE NOT SQUEAMISH
8131-117017-0010 WHEN IT WAS OVER THE TWO COVERED UP THEIR WHIMPERING CAPTIVE
8131-117017-0011 JENKINS THE OTHER COPP HAD BEEN HOLDING A WALLET
8131-117017-0012 MUST HAVE BEEN MAKING A BIG MISTAKE IN SOMETHING FIFTY FIFTY
8131-117017-0013 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OVER ONE THOUSAND CREDITS IN THE WALLET
8131-117017-0014 WHEN GORDON AND JENKINS CAME BACK MURDOCK TOSSED THE MONEY TO THEM SPLIT THEM
8131-117017-0015 WHATEVER COMES TO HAND GOVERNOR A

8131-117017-0027 THANKS IZZIE THANKS TO YOURSELF
8131-117017-0028 THE GID POCKETED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY NODDING
8131-117017-0029 THE LITTLE GUY KNEW MARS AS FEW OTHERS DID PROBABLY FROM ALL SIDES
8131-117017-0030 AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COPPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN ISSY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USE THE INFORMATION WITH THE BEAT SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT TO THE UPPER BRACKETS HE'D STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS
8131-117017-0031 THE CAPTAIN LOOKED COMPLETELY BEATEN AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM AND DROPPED ON TO THE BEACH

8131-117029-0002 ONLY GORDON AND SHEELA WERE LEFT

8131-117029-0004 GORDON CAME TO A ROW OF TEMPORARY BUBBLES INDIVIDUAL DWELLINGS BUILT LIKE THIS DOME BUT OPAQUE FOR PRIVACY
8131-117029-0005 THEY HAD BEEN LUCK

8188-269288-0009 BUT SHE ADDED ABRUPTLY YOU SPEAK OF SOMETHING WHICH WILL NOT TAKE PLACE
8188-269288-0010 I MUST PARENT HONOURS IF I DON'T I SHALL DIE
8188-269288-0011 A FEW MOMENTS LATER THERE CAME A TAP TO THE DOOR
8188-269288-0012 LIZLIE OPENED THE DOOR
8188-269288-0013 JAMES HERRIOTT STOOD WITHOUT
8188-269288-0014 THE LETTERS HAVE JUST COME FOR YOU AND ANNIE COLCHESTER SHE SAID AND AS I WAS COMING UPSTAIRS I THOUGHT I WOULD LEAVE THEM WITH YOU
8188-269288-0015 LIZIA THANKED HER AND EAGERLY GRASPED THE LITTLE PARCEL
8188-269288-0016 HER EYES SHONE WITH PLEASURE AT THE ANTICIPATION OF THE DELIGHTFUL TIME SHE WOULD HAVE REVELLING IN THE HOME NEWS THE OTHER LETTER WAS DIRECTED TO EMILY COLCHESTER

8188-269288-0022 LISLEY SEATED HERSELF WITH HER BACK TO HER COMPANION AND OPENED HER OWN LETTERS

8188-269288-0026 I SHALL KNOW I KNOW A WAY
8188-269288-0027 JUST AFTER DINNER SHE ROSE WITH A SIGH TO PREPARE FOR BED
8188-269288-0028 AND SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM
8188-269288-0029 NOW I REMEMBER SHE GOT A LETTER WHICH UPSET HER VERY MUCH AND WENT ABOUT
8188-269288-0030 LIZY WENT TO THE WINDOW AND FLUNG IT OPEN SHE PUT HER HEAD OUT AND TRIED TO PEER INTO THE DARKNESS BUT THE MOON HAD ALREADY SET AND SHE COULD NOT SEE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF YARDS IN FRONT OF HER
8188-269288-0031 SHE IS A VERY QUEER ERRATIC CREATURE AND THAT LETTER THERE WAS BAD NEWS IN THIS LETTER
8188-269288-0032 WHAT CAN SHE BE DOING OUTSIDE BY HERSELF
8188-269288-0033 LISLIE LEFT THE ROOM BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY GONE A DOZEN PACES DOWN THE CORRIDOR BEFORE SHE MET ANYTHING RETURNING
8188-269288-0034 ANNIE'S EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT HER CHEEKS WERE NO LONGER PALE AND THERE WAS A BRIGHT COLOUR IN THEM
8188-269288-0035 SHE DID NOT TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE OF LIZY BUT GOING INTO THE ROOM SHUT THE DOOR
8188-269288-0036 DON'T BEGIN SAID JERRY
8188-269288-0037 DON'T BEGIN WHAT DO YOU WANT
8188-269288-0038 I MEAN THAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET TO ASK QUESTIONS
8188-269288-0039 I WALKED UP AND DOWN AS FAST AS EVER I COULD DOWN IN ORDER TO MAKE MYSELF SLEEPY
8188-269288-0040 DON'T TALK TO ME LIZZIL DON'T SAY A SINGLE WORD
8188-269288-0041 I SHALL GO OFF TO SLEEP THAT WAS ALL I CARE FOR

8188-269288-0043 NOW DRINK IT AT ONCE SHE SAID IN A VOICE OF AUTHORITY IF YOU REALLY WISH TO SLEEP

8188-269288-0048 SHE GOT IN BED AS SHE SPOKE AND WRAPPED THE CLOTHES TIGHTLY ROUND HER
8188-269288-0049 CAN'T YOU MANAGE WITH A SCANDAL JUST FOR ONCE
8188-269288-0050 CERTAINLY CEDED EASILY
8188-269288-0051 SHE TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND LIT A CANDLE WHICH I PUT BEHIND HER SCREEN THEN PREPARED TO GET INTO BED
8188-269288-0052 ANNIE'S NAME WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS
8188-269288-0053 ANNIE DID NOT MEAN TO CONFIDE IN ANY ONE THAT NIGHT BUT THE KINDEST THING WAS TO LEAVE HER ALONE
8188-269288-0054 TIRED OUT LIZLIE HERSELF DROPPED TO SLEEP
8188-269288-0055 ADAM IS THAT YOU SHE CALLED OUT
8188-269288-0056 THERE WAS NO REPLY BUT THE SOUND OF HURRYING STEPS CAME QUICKER AND QUICKER NOW AND THEN THEY WERE INTERRUPTED WITH A GROAN
8188-269288-0057 OH THIS WILL KILL ME MY HEART WILL BREAK THIS WOULD KILL ME
8188-269290-0000 THE GUILD OF SAINT ALBERT
8188-269290-0001 IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER THAT EVENING LISLIE RAN UP TO HER ROOM TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR HER VISIT TO EAST HILL

8188-269290-0010 WRAPPING HER PRETTY BLUE SHAWL ROUND HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS SHE TURNED TO ANNIE
8188-269290-0011 LISLIE WAS JUST CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER WHEN JOHNNIE CALLED AFTER HER

8188-269290-0016 JANE HERMITT'S VOICE WAS HEARD IN THE PASSAGE
8188-269290-0017 AS SHE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR SHE HEARD IT BEING HEARD IN THE LOCK
8188-269290-0018 WHAT CAN YOU MEAN SHE SAID TO HERSELF

8188-269290-0032 SCARCELY LIKELY REPLIED LESLIE SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO COME TO MEETING
8188-269290-0033 BUT MARGERY AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LISLIE AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
8188-269290-0034 MISS LAUDERDALE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHERS TUTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE DIFFERENT HALLS ON A RAISED PLATFORM
8188-269290-0035 THEN A REAL CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE WAS ANY COLCHESTER
8188-269290-0036 THE PHYSICAL PART OF YOUR TRAINING AND ALSO THE MENTAL PART ARE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED IN THIS GREAT HOUSE OF LEARNING SHE CONTINUED BUT THE PHYSICAL PART IT SEEMS TO ME OUGHT NOW TO BE STRENGTHENED
8188-269290-0037 HEAR HERE AN ONCE AGAIN HERE
8188-269290-0038 SHE UTTERED HER STRAIN REMARK STANDING UP
8188-269290-0039 MARGERY AND EILEEN WAS CLOSE TO HER
8188-269290-0040 I WILL TALK WITH YOU BELLE ARCHERSEN PRESENTLY SHE SAID
8188-269290-0041 THE NAMES OF THE PROPOSED MEMBERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO ME AFTER THIS DAY WEEK
8188-269290-0042 AM I MY SISTER'S KEEPER
8188-269290-0043 YOU THINK SHE CONTINUED
8188-269290-0044 GOD ANSWERS FOR EACH OF YOU YOU ARE
8188-269290-0045 THE WORLD SAYS NO I AM NOT BUT GOD SAYS IF YOU ARE
8188-269290-0046 ALL MEN ARE YOUR BROTHER
8188-269290-0047 FOR ALL WHO SIN OR WHO SUFFER YOU ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RESPONSIBLE
8188-269290-0048 AFTER THE DRESS THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
8188-269290-0049 IT WAS AT TEN O'CLOCK WHEN SHE LEFT THE HALL
8188-269290-0050 JUST AS SHE WAS DOING SO MISS FRERE CAME IN
8188-269290-0051 ANNIE COLCHESTER IS YOUR ROOMFELLOW IS SHE NOT SHE
8188-269290-0052 I SEE BY YOUR FACE MISSUS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DISTRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING ARE YOU TAKING ANYTHING BACK
8188-269290-0053 I'M AFRAID I AM SAID LIZZIE DISTRESSED NOW IN HER TONE
8188-269290-0054 I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS LUDERDALE EXCEPT A VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED HERSELF
8188-269290-0055 EXCUSES WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
8188-269290-0056 THE GIRL WHO BREAKS HER RULES HAS TO BE PUNISHED
8188-269290-0057 I MUST TELL HER
8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THEIR ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHILE THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND THIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MONTMERRIS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICIALS OF THE FAMILY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE CAPITAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0004 WHY THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER IT
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW A FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS INTENT UPON THIS CRIME BEFORE MYSELF
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION AWAKE THOSE SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UP A CHIMNEY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVE LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALL FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0007 HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE CONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE CORNERWEALTH
8188-274364-0008 MY LORDS I HAVE NOW TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I HAVE DONE
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG VANE FALLING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THE MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO CLYM WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THIS DISPOSITION BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU WERE ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT
8280-266249-0000 OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITIONS OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0001 AS THESE WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOUR
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO PUT THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0004 THERE ARE SOME NICE LOOKING WOMEN ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0005 BESIDES OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RANNALL LAUGHING
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ANSWERED THAT LITTLE GROUP YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I
8280-266249-0007 AND WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR HAROLD I SHOULD JUDGE
8280-266249-0008 DO YOU SIGN WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009 IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE BOY
8280-266249-0010 SUPPOSE WE AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRANK
8280-266249-0011 I DO INDEED THOUGH PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF HIS AILMENTS
8280-266249-0012 DOUBTLESS THERE IS THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMAN'S CABIN WHEN THERE IS A LIGHT
8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND TAKEN OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT OF TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF A DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA IN FAINTING
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE HUNDRED TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0017 IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A HUNDRED AILMENTS
8280-266249-0018 THAT THE FRENCH POLYTECHNICA INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE UPON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS UPON THE MIND
8280-266249-0019 NOTICE THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW THEY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEWERS
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATIONS
8280-266249-0021 AND THEN SUCH WONDERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0022 HENCE A RESORT FOR CIDER AND BEER
8280-266249-0023 NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD THAT YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN
8280-266249-0024 FOR YE HAVE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GODS
8280-266249-0025 WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR LIVES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE WHOLLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICES
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BEEN FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALY
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISSUS LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND NOT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE IN THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0030 THEY HAVE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0031 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN MY DIRECTION
8280-266249-0032 SIR HE IS NOT HERE
8280-266249-0033 AND THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TWO
8280-266249-0034 NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD EVIDENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0035 HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE INSTANTLY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING TO HIS STATEROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0036 WHICH DOES IT MEAN CRIED ONE
8280-266249-0037 A VENTRILOQUISTIVEBOARD OF COURSE RETURNED ANOTHER LET'S FOLLOW AND SEE THE FUN
8280-266249-0038 I WONDER WHICH OF THESE IT IS REMARKED THE FIRST LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT COME ON
8280-266249-0039 THAT FELLOW NICK WARD IS A NOTED BLACK LEG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND WAS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE
8280-266249-0040 WHO ASKED THE MATE I'VE SEEN NAUGHT UP HERE THOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THE STEERAGE
8280-266249-0041 THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A CRUEL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8280-266249-0042 A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING INTO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0043 LET ME GO YELLED WARD MAKING THE DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIS ARMS
8280-266249-0044 I DINKS NO I TINKS I DID YOU VON LASSEN RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
8280-266249-0045 THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE NECK OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0046 MISTER BILBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0047 NOW THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSION
8280-266249-0048 THEY KEPT IT UP AFTER MIDNIGHT
8280-266249-0049 AND MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN HIS STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0050 AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STAKES WERE HEAVY
8280-266249-0051 THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GRAY BACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EARS TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THAT DREAD SOUND
8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS WITH A FORCED NATURAL LAUGH
8280-266249-0054 IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED ROD LOOK WHAT'S THERE LOOK YOURSELF
8280-266249-0055 WHAT KIN IT HA BEEN THEY ASKED EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0056 OH NONSENSE WHAT FOOLISHS WE ARE
8280-266249-0057 IT WAS THE LAST GAME OF CARDS FOR THAT TRIBE
8280-266249-0058 THE CAPTAIN COMING INTO SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0059 TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DAILIES WERE IN A VERY STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0060 OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN WILLING TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE

8280-266249-0062 ELSIE ANSWERED PRESSING HIS HAND AFFECTIONATELY ARE WE NOT SISTERS IN CHRIST
8280-266249-0063 YE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD BY FAITH AND CHRIST JESUS

8280-266249-0065 WE FEEL MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE ARE ONLY THE STEWARDS OF HIS BOUNTY AND BECAUSE HE HAS SAID INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME THAT IS THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE AND DELIGHT TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIS PEOPLE

8461-258277-0005 AND SHE THREW DOWN THE JEW'S HAIR BEFORE HIM
8461-258277-0006 NOW THE CASE OF HER SLAYING HER SIRE WAS AS FOLLOWS
8461-258277-0007 THEN HE SET OUT REJOICINGLY TO RETURN TO THE BARRACK OF THE FORTY

8461-258277-0014 QUOTH OUR RASHID WHOSE HEAD IS THIS
8461-258277-0015 SO ALI RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT PASSED FROM FIRST TO LAST AND THE CALIPH SAID I HAD NOT THOUGHT THAT THOU WOULDST KILL HIM FOR THAT HE WAS A SORCERER
8461-258277-0016 SHE REPLIED I HAVE FORTY LADS BUT THEY ARE IN CAIRO
8461-278226-0000 AND LAURA HAD HER OWN PART PLANS
8461-278226-0001 SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENT AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED A SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WEAR THEIR NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JUVIN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM SO HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-278226-0003 I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES THOSE MODERN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
8461-278226-0004 I REMEMBER ALL THAT REUBENS SAYS AT THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
8461-278226-0005 SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE A SPRING SKY WITH POOR GRAY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOLS AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AYESHA BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0006 IT WAS DRAWING TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0007 BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAYS SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN IN THE GALLERY
8461-278226-0008 PHILIP JOCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN THE WIFE MADE THE DISCOVERY
8461-278226-0009 HOW I WISH HE COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE OF PHILIP LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
8461-278226-0010 I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MOURNING ROOM AT JOCELYN STROUGH
8461-278226-0011 SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ARTIST PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KIRSTOFF LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
8461-278226-0012 THEY HAD SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF OF THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
8461-278226-0013 BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARD THE WORK OF OTHERS
8461-278226-0014 I DON'T THINK HE'LL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HOUSE
8461-278226-0015 YOU WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOR PHIL IF YOU'LL SAY YES
8461-281231-0000 HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGING THE WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS
8461-281231-0001 IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORKELETON
8461-281231-0002 AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH THE DREAD OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
8461-281231-0003 WHAT ART THOU HE EXCLAIMED WITH TERROR
8461-281231-0004 LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH EURETA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
8461-281231-0005 EXCLAIMED THE GERMAN HO

8461-281231-0007 THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID AURRICA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO WOULD EXTINGUISH THEM
8461-281231-0008 MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED HIM FROM THOSE WITHIN
8461-281231-0009 THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY THAT BRACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
8461-281231-0010 THE BLACK NIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCED HIS WAY INWARD IN DESPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
8461-281231-0011 TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL OUR LEADER'S EFFORTS TO STOP THEM
8461-281231-0012 THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL WRUNG WITH VARIOUS BLOWS
8461-281231-0013 AT LENGTH DE BROCY FELL
8461-281231-0014 TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK THY LEISURE ON ME
8461-281231-0015 YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE STRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS THEE TO KNOW
8461-281231-0016 EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER AND PRECIOUS
8461-281231-0017 THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS PAPER
8461-281231-0018 RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH US THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS
8461-281231-0019 BUT IN THE OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT FRONT DE BOEUF
8461-281231-0020 AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE EUREKA APPEARED IN ONE OF THE TURRETS
8461-281231-0021 BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND ROSE THROUGH THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SENT FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTERS
8461-281231-0022 AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GIVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED HER TYRANT
8461-281231-0023 WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORKERLESTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
8461-281231-0024 HE LEFT THE GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF KOENIGSBERG AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTER OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ADDLESTANE WAS LAID
8461-281231-0025 DE BLACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOOD
8461-281231-0026 HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT AS A MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARINGS
8461-281231-0027 SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS STRONG WAR HORSE AND RODE OFF THROUGH THE FORESTS
8461-281231-0028 DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORKE SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER REBECCA
8461-281231-0029 AND WITH HIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
8461-281231-0030 THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FROM DE BOEUF WE WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
8461-281231-0031 HE APPEALED TO DE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN HIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARD HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
8461-281231-0032 BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LYCAS OF BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY
8461-281231-0033 HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION AT LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
8461-281231-0034 POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY OF HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK AROUND AND TO ASK INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
8461-281231-0036 SHE GAZED DIRECTLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
8461-281231-0037 AT HIS FEET WERE PLACED A TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
8461-281231-0038 THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THEIR SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THEIR ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
