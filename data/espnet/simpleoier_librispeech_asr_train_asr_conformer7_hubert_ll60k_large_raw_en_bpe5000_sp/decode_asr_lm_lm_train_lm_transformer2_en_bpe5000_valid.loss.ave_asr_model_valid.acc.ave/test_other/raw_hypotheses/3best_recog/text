1688-142285-0000 THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWN STAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU'VE THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKE THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS A THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU ARE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHERE HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHEWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 HIS FATHER DIE IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WHILE HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORTH TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARD IMMEDIATELY AND MISSUS THORNTON IS NOT WONT I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LEFT WILTON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED SAID HER FATHER
1688-142285-0016 OH PAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERY THING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE NATIONAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN ABOUT HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAYS THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORD
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER FATHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER OUT THEY CAME
1688-142285-0024 MAMMA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0025 AN I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0026 PERSONLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL
1688-142285-0027 I DON'T SET UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0028 BUT GOODNIGHT CHILD
1688-142285-0029 THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISS HALE
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN A BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBERS SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER PERSONALLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF HER MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE THE WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE BUT VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREETS AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL HOW ARE YOU
1688-142285-0038 BETTER AND BETTER IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
1688-142285-0039 NOT EXACTLY RETURNED MARGARET SMILING
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED OF MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND OF BOOLAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FURTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED ROUND TO WALK LONG SIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
1688-142285-0042 BUT FOR A MOMENT OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0043 AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOWER VOICE
1688-142285-0044 BESSY YOU WISH TO DIE
1688-142285-0045 BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MOMENT OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED
1688-142285-0046 NOT WORSE THAN ANY OTHERS I RECKON
1688-142285-0047 BUT WHAT IS IT
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON
1688-142285-0049 I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR A TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
1688-142285-0050 I SHALL HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW
1688-142285-0051 THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYES TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALID STREET BESSIE SAID
1688-142285-0053 YOU'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GROFFISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0054 BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN HE ENTERED
1688-142285-0055 GASPED BETSY AT LAST
1688-142285-0056 BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSIE DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT TO YOU AND MAKE IT WHAT IT IS
1688-142285-0059 NOW I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAY THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0061 I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE NO MORE
1688-142285-0062 THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG WOMEN
1688-142285-0063 I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY A GOOD DEAL
1688-142285-0064 BUT WHO'S COME AT LAST AND WHO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HE'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT WHO KNOWS NAUGHT ABOUT
1688-142285-0065 IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOT HARD TO WORK
1688-142285-0066 BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLAYED IT MORE WITH MARGARET
1688-142285-0067 DON'T THINK ON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
1688-142285-0068 I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOKED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF ARTHUR IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0069 THE FEVERISH COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEKS AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYES
1688-142285-0070 BUT YOU'LL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL OH MY HEART
1688-142285-0071 SHE PUT A HAND TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALE
1688-142285-0072 MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT HER WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
1688-142285-0073 PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
1688-142285-0075 I'LL COME TOMORROW SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0076 MARY WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
1688-142285-0077 SHE WAS LATE TO TEA AT HOME
1688-142285-0078 HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERVANT
1688-142285-0079 NO MAMA THAT ANNE BUCKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
1688-142285-0080 SPOSE I TRY SAID MISTER HALE

1688-142285-0082 I MAY BE CINDERELLA TO PUT ON THE SLIPPER AFTER ALL
1688-142285-0083 WHAT WOULD YE DO PAPA HOW WOULD YE SET ABOUT IT
1688-142285-0084 WELL I I WOULD APPLY IT TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS
1688-142285-0085 VERY GOOD BUT WE MUST FIRST CATCH OUR HOUSE
1688-142285-0086 THAT MOTHER OF WHOM HE SPOKE TO US SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0087 MISTER THORNTON THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISSUS HALE QUIETLY
1688-142285-0088 I LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
1688-142285-0089 PERHAPS SHE MIGHT HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
1688-142285-0090 SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANYTHING OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
1688-142285-0091 MY DEAR SAID MISTER HALE ALARMED PRAY DON'T GO OFF ON THE IDEA
1688-142285-0092 I AM SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANY THING ABOUT IT
1688-142285-0093 TAKE NOTICE THIS IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT

1998-29455-0037 NOR WAS IT SUNDAY ON WHICH THEY TOOK A REST AND WASHED THEIR SHIRTS ACCORDING TO MISTER BEARD'S RULE OF LIFE
1998-29455-0038 THEY DID NOT STAY THERE BUT WALKED OUT ACROSS THE DOWNS WHERE THE SKYLARKS WERE SINGING AND ON THE DIP OF THE DOWNS CAME UPON GREAT STONE WALLS AND TOWERS VERY STRONG AND GRAY

2033-164914-0003 REJOINED THE EUNUCH WHO THEN WAS A RECITER POINT HIM OUT TO ME
2033-164914-0004 BY ALLAH REPLIED THE FIRE MAN I TELL THEE THE TRUTH

2033-164914-0007 AND HE ALSO IMPROVISED THE TWO FOLLOWING DISPATCHS
2033-164914-0008 WHEN NUSHA AL ZAMAN HEARD THE FIRST IMPROVISATION SHE CALLED TO MIND HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER AND HER BROTHER AND THEIR WILLUM HOME THEN SHE WEPT AND CRIED TO THE EUNUCH AND SAID TO HIM WOE TO THEE

2033-164914-0012 RETURN QUIETLY AND LINGER NOT
2033-164914-0013 THEN IT WAS THE SEVENTY THIRD NIGHT
2033-164914-0014 BUT THE EUNUCH SAID I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE TILL THOU TELL ME WHO IT WAS THAT RECITED THE VERSES FOR I DREAD RETURNING TO MY LADY WITHOUT HIM
2033-164914-0015 NOW WHEN THE FIREMAN HEARD THESE WORDS HE FEARED FOR ZAU AL MAKAN AND WEPT WITH EXCEEDING WEEPING AND SAID TO THE EUNUCH BY ALLAH IT WAS NOT I AND I KNOW HIM NOT

2033-164914-0017 THEN HE KISSED THE EUNUCH'S HEAD AND SPAKE HIM FAIR TILL HE WENT AWAY BUT THE CASTRATO FETCHED ROUND AND RETURNING SECRETLY CAME AND STOOD BEHIND THE FIREMAN FEARING TO GO BACK TO HIS MISTRESS WITHOUT TIDINGS
2033-164914-0018 I SAY WHAT MAKE MY IGNOMINY WHATE'ER THE BITTER CUP I DRAIN FAR BE FROM ME THY LAND TO FLEE NOR WILL I BOW TO THOSE WHO BLAME AND FOR SUCH LOVE WOULD DEAL ME SHAME
2033-164914-0019 THEN SAID THE EUNUCH TO ZAL AL MAKAN PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY LORD
2033-164914-0020 O MY LORD CONTINUED THE EUNUCH AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND SEEMED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY

2033-164914-0022 THEN THE EUNUCH WENT OUT TO ZAL MAKAN AND SAID TO HIM RECITE WHAT VERSES THOU KNOWEST FOR MY LADY IS HERE HARD BY LISTENING TO THEE AND I WILL ASK THEE OF THY NAME AND THY NATIVE COUNTRY AND THY CONDITION
2033-164915-0000 AND ALL SO THESE
2033-164915-0001 SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HE GATHERED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN FELL DOWN IN A FAINTING FIT
2033-164915-0002 WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW THESE CASE HE WONDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEWHAT TO COVER THEM WAITED TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
2033-164915-0003 AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND UZHA AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LEFT HER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THESE VERSES
2033-164915-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANTS HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM HOW HE HAD GONE FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BAYING HOW HE HAD MADE A MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD GONE IN TO HER AND HOW THE KING THEIR SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARRKAN
2033-164915-0005 BUT NOW GO TO MY MASTER AND BRING HIM QUICKLY TO ME
2033-164915-0006 THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED A CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE STOCKER TILL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRDING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
2033-164915-0007 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE TALKER GIRDED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING O WOULD I KNEW WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM
2033-164915-0008 I BELIEVE HE HATH DENOUNCED ME TO THE EUNUCH HENCE THESE PAGES AND ABOUT ME AND HE HATH MADE ME AN ACCOMPLICE IN HIS CRIME
2033-164915-0009 WHY DOST THOU SAY I NEVER REPEATED THESE COUPLETS NOR DO I KNOW WHO REPEATED THEM WHEN IT WAS THY COMPANION
2033-164915-0010 BUT NOW I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE BETWEEN THIS PLACE AND BAGDAD AND WHAT BETIDETH THY COMRADES SHALL BETIDE THEE
2033-164915-0011 TWAS AS I FEARED THE COMING ILLS DESCENDING BUT UNTO ALLAH WE ARE ALL RETURNING
2033-164915-0012 THEN THE EUNUCH CRIED UPON THE PAGES SAYING TAKE OFF THE ASS
2033-164915-0013 AND HE ANSWERED I AM THE CHAMBERLAIN OF THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS KING SHARKAN SON OF OMAR BIN AL NUMAN LORD OF BAGDAD AND OF THE LAND OF KHORASAN AND I BRING TRIBUTE AND PRESENTS FROM HIM TO HIS FATHER IN BAGDAD
2033-164915-0014 SO FARE YE FORWARDS NO HARM SHALL BEFALL YOU TILL YOU JOIN HIS GRAND WAZIR NADAN
2033-164915-0015 THEN HE BADE HIM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO KING OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND TRIBUTE OF SYRIA
2033-164915-0016 SO IT WAS AGREED THAT WE GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARKAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHER'S REALM
2033-164915-0017 AND AMONGST THEM WERE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE CADET ZAU AL MAKAN FOR QUOTH THEY HIS NAME BE LIGHT OF THE PLACE AND HE HATH A SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HIGHZ THE DELIGHT OF THE TIME BUT THEY SET OUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOR ALHIJAZ AND NONE WOTTETH WHAT IS BECOME OF THEM
2033-164916-0000 SO HE TURNED TO THE WAZIR DONDAN AND SAID TO HIM VERILY YOUR TALE IS A WONDER OF WONDERS
2033-164916-0001 KNOW O CHIEF WAZIR THAT HERE WHERE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED ME ALLAH HATH GIVEN YOU REST FROM FATIGUE AND BRINGETH YOU YOUR DESIRE AFTER THE EASIEST OF FASHIONS FOR THAT HIS ALMIGHTY WILL RESTORETH TO YOU ZOUMA KHAN AND HIS SISTER NUZHAD AL ZAMAN WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN
2033-164916-0002 WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID OH CHAMBERLAYNE TELL ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFELL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
2033-164916-0003 ZAUMARKAN BOWED HIS HEAD A WHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THE POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELLED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM ON THE RIGHT WAY
2033-164916-0004 THEN HE ADDED OH MY UNCLE HOW SHALL I DO WITH MY BROTHER SHARKAN
2033-164916-0005 AFTER A WHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE FULL TIDE SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
2033-164916-0006 THEN IT WAS THE SEVENTY EIGHTH NIGHT
2033-164916-0007 IN IT ALL REJOICED AT THE ACCESSION OF THE LIGHT OF THE PLACE
2033-164916-0008 LASTLY THE MINISTER WENT IN AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE ZAL MAKAN WHO ROSE TO MEET HIM SAYING WELCOME O WAZIR AND SIRE'S SONSPIER
2033-164916-0009 MOREOVER THE SULTAN COMMANDED HIS WAZIR DUNDAN CALL A TEN DAYS HALT OF THE ARMY THAT HE MIGHT BE PRIVATE WITH HIM AND LEARN FROM HIM HOW AND WHEREFORE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN SLAIN
2033-164916-0010 HE THEN REPAIRED TO THE HEART OF THE ENCAMPMENT AND ORDERED A HOST TO HALT TEN DAYS
2414-128291-0000 WHAT HAVE HAPPENED UNTO ME
2414-128291-0001 HE ASKED HIMSELF SOMETHING WARM AND LIVING QUICKENETH ME IT MUST BE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD
2414-128291-0002 WHEN HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA WAS QUITE NIGH UNTO THEM THEN DID HE HEAR PLAINLY THAT A HUMAN VOICE SPAKE IN THE MIDST OF THE KINE AND APPARENTLY ALL OF THEM HAD TURNED THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THE SPEAKER
2414-128291-0003 WHAT DID I HERE SEEK
2414-128291-0004 ANSWERED HE THE SAME THAT THOU SEEKEST THOU MISCHIEF MAKER THAT IS TO SAY HAPPINESS UPON THE EARTH
2414-128291-0005 FOR I TELL THEE THAT I HAD ALREADY TALKED HALF A MORNING UNTO THEM AND JUST NOW WERE THEY ABOUT TO GIVE ME THEIR ANSWER
2414-128291-0006 HE WOULD NOT BE RID OF HIS AFFLICTION
2414-128291-0007 HE HAD NOT AT PRESENT HIS HEART HIS MOUTH AND HIS EYES FULL OF DISGUST
2414-128291-0008 THOU ALSO THOU
2414-128291-0009 BUT BEHOLD HIS KING
2414-128291-0010 DE CAEN HOWEVER GAZED AT IT ALL AND WONDERED

2414-128291-0014 WHY DIDST THOU TEMPT ME
2414-128291-0015 THE OTHER
2414-128291-0016 THOU KNOWEST IT THYSELF BETTER THAN I
2414-128291-0017 THUS SPAKE THE PEACEFUL ONE AND PUFFED HIMSELF AND PERSPIRED WITH HIS WORDS SO THAT THE KINE WONDERED ANEW
2414-128291-0018 THOU DOEST VIOLENCE TO THYSELF THOU PREACHER ON THE MOUNT AND THOU USEST SUCH SAVIOR WORDS
2414-128291-0019 THEY ALSO ABSTAIN FROM ALL EVIL THOUGHTS WHICH INFLATE THE HEART
2414-128291-0020 AGAIN
2414-128291-0021 SAID ZARATHUSTRA THOU SHOULDST ALSO SEE MINE ANIMALS MINE EAGLE AND MY SERPENT THEY ALIKE DO NOT AT PRESENT EXIST ON EARTH
2414-128291-0022 AND TALKED TO MINE ANIMALS OF THE HAPPINESS OF ANIMALS
2414-128291-0023 NOW HOWEVER TAKE LEAVE AT ONCE OF THY KINE THOU STRANGE ONE
2414-128291-0024 THOU MERRY ONE
2414-128291-0025 FOR THEY ARE THY WARMEST FRIENDS AND PERCEPTORS

2414-128292-0002 WHAT MATTERS ABOUT MY SHADOW
2414-128292-0003 LET IT RUN AFTER ME AND RUN AWAY FROM IT
2414-128292-0004 THUS SPAKE HER TOO STRAIGHT TO HIS HEART AND RAN AWAY
2414-128292-0005 VERILY MY FOLLY HATH GROWN BIG IN THE MOUNTAINS
2414-128292-0006 NOW I HEAR SIX OLD FOOL'S LEGS RATTLING BEHIND ONE ANOTHER
2414-128292-0007 BUT DOTH ZARATHUSTRA NEED TO BE FRIGHTENED BY HIS SHADOW
2414-128292-0008 ALSO METHINKETH THAT AFTER ALL IT HATH LONG OR LESS THAN MINE
2414-128292-0009 FOR WHEN THE ATUSTRA SCRUTINIZED HIM WITH ITS GLANCE HE WAS FRIGHTENED AS BY A SUDDEN APPARITION SO SLENDER SWARTHY HOLLOW AND WORN OUT DID HIS FOLLOWER APPEAR
2414-128292-0010 ASKED ARTUSTRA VEHEMENTLY WHAT DOST THOU HERE
2414-128292-0011 AND WHY CALLST THOU THYSELF MY SHADOW
2414-128292-0012 THOU ART NOT PLEASING IN ME
2414-128292-0013 MUST I BE ON THE WAY
2414-128292-0014 O ART THOU HAST BECOME TOO WRONG FOR ME
2414-128292-0015 WHEN THE DEVIL CASTETH HIS SKIN DOTH NOT HIS NAME ALSO FALL AWAY IT IS ALSO
2414-128292-0016 THE DEVIL HIMSELF IS PERHAPS KIND
2414-128292-0017 SOMETIMES I MEANT TO DIE AND BEHOLD
2414-128292-0018 THEN ONLY DID I HIT THAT TRUTH
2414-128292-0019 HOW HAD I STILL INCLINATION
2414-128292-0020 HAVE I A GIRL
2414-128292-0021 A HEAVEN TOWARDS WHICH MY SAIL IS SET
2414-128292-0022 FOR IT TOO I ASK AND SEEK AND HAVE SOUGHT BUT I HAVE NOT FOUND
2414-128292-0023 OH ETERNAL EVERYWHERE OH ETERNAL NOWHERE O ETERNAL IN VAIN
2414-128292-0024 THOU ART A SHADOW
2414-128292-0025 SAID HE AT LAST GLADLY
2414-128292-0026 THY DANGER IS NOT SMALL THOU FREE SERVANT AND WANDERER
2414-128292-0027 THEY SLEEP QUIETLY THEY ENJOYED THEIR NEW SECURITY
2414-128292-0028 BEWARE LEST IN THE END THE NARROW FAITH CAPTURE THEE A HARD RIGOROUS DELUSION
2414-128292-0029 FOR NOW EVERYTHING IS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTETH THEE
2414-128292-0030 THOU HAST LOST MY GOAL
2414-128292-0031 THOU POOR ROVER AND RAMBLERS THOU TIRED BUTTERFLY
2414-128292-0032 WILT THOU HAVE A REST IN THE HOME THIS EVENING
2414-159411-0000 ONCE ON A TIME A BRAHMIN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM
2414-159411-0001 THE BRAHMIN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF A CAGE YOU WILL EAT ME
2414-159411-0002 O FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN TRUTH I WILL NOT
2414-159411-0003 I WILL NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER IN RETURN
2414-159411-0004 THEN THE BRAHMIN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE TURNED SO THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARDS
2414-159411-0005 SO THE BRAHMIN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A ABANDON TREE AND THE BRAHMIN SAID TO IT BANNANT TREE BANNON TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0006 ON WHAT MUST I BEAR JUDGMENT ASKED THE BANDANT TREE
2414-159411-0007 THIS TIGER SAID THE BRAMIN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF THE CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LEFT HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME
2414-159411-0008 IT WAS JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NO
2414-159411-0009 LET THE TIGER EAT THAT MAN FOR MEN ARE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE
2414-159411-0010 SIR CAMEL SIR CAMEL SAID THE BRAHMAN HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0011 AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND THE BULLOCK LYING BY THE ROADSIDE
2414-159411-0012 IS IT FAIR THAT YOU SHOULD DO SO OR NOT
2414-159411-0013 LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MAN HAVE NO PITY
2414-159411-0014 THREE OUT OF SIX AND GIVING JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMIN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINED TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
2414-159411-0015 ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASK THE EAGLE
2414-159411-0016 AND THE BRAHMIN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONES
2414-159411-0017 THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID JUDGMENT OF ALL IS AGAINST YOU O BRAHMAIN
2414-159411-0018 AFTER THIS THEY SAW AN ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMAN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE VERDICT
2414-159411-0019 BUT THE ALLIGATORS SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRIED TO KILL ME
2414-159411-0020 THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM HEAR THE OPINION OF THE SIXTH JUDGE
2414-159411-0021 AND THE SIXTH WAS A JACKAL
2414-159411-0022 THE BRAHMIN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKAL UNCLE JACKAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0023 SHOW ME THAT PLACE
2414-159411-0024 AND THE GUARD THERE THE JAKAL SAID NOW BRAHMIN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD
2414-159411-0025 EXACTLY THERE WAS IT SAID THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0026 EXACTLY HERE REPLIED A BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0027 WHERE WAS THAT TIGER THEN
2414-159411-0028 WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE DIGGER JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON THIS SIDE
2414-159411-0029 VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL BUT I CANNOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER
2414-159411-0030 SHUT AND BOLTED SAID A BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0031 THEY SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0032 WHEN THE BRAMIN HAD DONE THIS THE JACKAL SAID OH YOU WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL TIGER
2414-159411-0033 WHEN A GOOD BRAMIN OPENED YOUR CARRIAGE DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WOULD MAKE
2414-159411-0034 PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEY FRIEND BAHMAN
2414-159411-0035 YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY IN MIND THIS
2414-165385-0000 THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUET AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLATTERING PAGAN BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILIZED MONKEY
2414-165385-0001 THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS INSTANCED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMIC WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU
2609-156975-0000 AND MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN
2609-156975-0001 HOWDORNE HOPHAST HODOUBT PAY SINCE HIS GENIUS
2609-156975-0002 LET'S HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MATRON MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET IT'S DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
2609-156975-0003 THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF A BONDAGE
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHOSE TURBANT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KIERNAPATH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIANS AND SCRIPZINS GIVE OF THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF A DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ALTAMI CARVETTES INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES PROSTRATE TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDO WERE THE CHIEF FACTORS IN THIS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
2609-156975-0008 THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATION OF HIS SOJOURN IN EGYPT
2609-156975-0009 THE LATER TRADITIONS SEEM TO EXTEND THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY PATUM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATUM
2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY IN SCRIPTS AND ULSTER STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHAM THE HOUSE OF RAMESES A CITY WITH THE ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES
2609-156975-0012 THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS CALAMITY WAS NATURALLY INEVITABLE
2609-156975-0013 WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM IT THE DESPOTIC ROAR OF THAT LAND AND DAY
2609-156975-0014 THE MAKINGS OF A LOYAL PATRIOT
2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES'S BIRTH AN EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
2609-156975-0016 WITH MOSES JUST FINDIN RESISTIN THE GYPSY TACT MASTER
2609-156975-0017 IS PENAGE ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
2609-156975-0018 NAT'REE HE WENT TO THE LAND O MIDIAN
2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTIAN FUGITIVES
2609-156975-0020 FROM TWO THOUSAND B C
2609-156975-0021 ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUIN HERDS WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
2609-156975-0022 THESE SAME WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KIDAM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN THE TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0024 THE SCORE OF THE WILDERNESS
2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUIT
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIEST OF THE SUBTRIBE OF THE KINITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0027 NOTE THE CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF THE MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT OUT WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KINITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAAWAY OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GUIDE WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0031 DO THE EARLIEST SEABREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0032 THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST MINISTERED IN SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0033 MOSES IN THE HOMES OF THE MIDIAN PRIESTS WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0034 THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE ITS TRAINING
2609-156975-0035 HIS QUEST WAS FOR AJUTS AND STRONG MEN ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENS HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON THE POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST AND TONIAN PLAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA MINOR STILL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVEN SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
2609-156975-0038 THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS INTRUSTED TO MOSES'S CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTION
2609-157645-0000 EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PRESENT FOR THE ROYAL FOE A TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
2609-157645-0001 THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGUING QUOD AT A SMOKIN IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
2609-157645-0002 SOMETIMES TOBACCO IS USED IN CHURCH FOR DISINFECTANT OR DIODORIZING PURPOSES
2609-157645-0003 BLACKBURN ART'S BICEP OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER
2609-157645-0004 ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH LININGHAM FOR A CONFIRM MASON
2609-157645-0005 ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER DIGNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTERY AT HATTON
2609-157645-0006 PAR WAS SUCH A CONTINUOUS SMOKER THAT ANYONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HADN'T NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF A PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENCE
2609-157645-0007 ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITSFIELD HE HANDED MASTER PIPE AND MASTER THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING EM PATENT
2609-157645-0008 LET THEM SING ANOTHER PSALM SAID THE CURATE
2609-157645-0009 I HAVE SIR REPLIED THE CLERK
2609-157645-0010 THEN LET EM SING THE HUNDRED AND NINETEENTH REPLIED THE CURATE
2609-157645-0011 SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AND AS MANY TOBACCO PIPES AS TO THE MAN OF OFFICE
2609-157645-0012 DAVID DEANE SAVOR DENY THAT ALL PROVED THIS IRREVERENCE
2609-157645-0013 GOING TO CHURCH SAINT HALE'S IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN A QUAINT AND A SIGNING EXPERIENCE
2609-157645-0014 WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND OUT I WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
2609-169640-0000 PARROTS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY THE SCEPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE SEEST FOUR OF THEM FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE
2609-169640-0001 AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JUST KEPT STEERAGEWAY ON THE SHIP
2609-169640-0002 FORTUNATELY THE JOHN WAS NOT ONLY FAT BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS THE LIGHTFOOTED GIRL TURNS IN UNLIVELY DANCE
2609-169640-0003 I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SIP POSTS HE SPECTS YOU IN MODERATE WEATHER
2609-169640-0004 MISTER MARVEL HE I DO B'LIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HINCOOPS BEING LIKE THE SAILORS AS ONE MIGHT SAY VERY ASLEEP
2609-169640-0005 AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE WHEN FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN A BOAT
2609-169640-0006 I SING OUT SAIL HO IN CLOSE ABOARD
2609-169640-0007 HE WAS TOO MUCH A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
2609-169640-0008 ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET OR TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
2609-169640-0009 AS OUR SEATS WERE HALF LYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT
2609-169640-0010 I SOON SAW BOTH PRANTZ AND GLAD ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER
2609-169640-0011 MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS ALSO AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCAL ABACK
2609-169640-0012 A DREADFUL STILLNESS SUCCEEDED
2609-169640-0013 THE PROATES DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED US FAST
2609-169640-0014 I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING PILES TOO AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
2609-169640-0015 KAIL WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
2609-169640-0016 THE STILLNESS WHICH REIGNED ON BOTH SIDES WAS LIKE THAT OF DEATH
2609-169640-0017 THE GIANT BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME ROUND LIKE A TAP
2609-169640-0018 THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER HE COULD PASS THEM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
2609-169640-0019 THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INCIDENT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE AND THE CLOSEST ATTENTION TO HIS ORDERS
2609-169640-0020 NOT A SOUL ON BOARD THE JOHN WAS HEARD
2609-169640-0021 ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMEN THE FOUR SIXES TWO AT THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERNMOST PROW WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
2609-169640-0022 THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN ANGERS
2609-169640-0023 I DOUBT IF WE'D TOUCH THE MAN IN THE NEAREST
2609-169640-0024 IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD OF HER CANVASS BINNED FORE LEAVING THE PROWER MOSTENOUS IN HER WAKE
3005-163389-0000 THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHIRBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK OF THE NOISE
3005-163389-0001 SOME SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEAR DOWN THE FENCES
3005-163389-0002 THIS STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY AND UNCOMFORTABLE
3005-163389-0003 SHIRBURN RUN HIS EYES SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUTGAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
3005-163389-0004 THE AVERAGEMAN'S A COWARD
3005-163389-0005 BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE MAN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARK AND IT'S JEST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
3005-163389-0006 SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH A HUNDRED MASKED COWARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCALS
3005-163389-0007 YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO COME
3005-163389-0008 BUT A MOB WITHOUT ANY MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT IS BEYOND PITIFULNESS
3005-163389-0009 NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN UP ACROSS HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAID THIS
3005-163389-0010 THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AND THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AN BUCK HARKNESS HE HEALED IT AFTER THEM LOOKING INTOLERABLE CHEAP
3005-163389-0011 YE CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
3005-163389-0012 THEY ARGUED AND TRIED TO KEEP HIM OUT BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE WHOLE SHOW COMING TO A STANDSTILL
3005-163389-0013 ONE OR TWO WOMEN BEGAN TO SCREAM
3005-163389-0014 SO THEN THE RING MASTER HE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE AND IF A MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSE
3005-163389-0015 IT WARN'T FUNNY TO ME THOUGH I WAS ALL OF A TREMBLE TO SEE HIS ANGER
3005-163389-0016 AN THE HORSE A GOIN LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE TOO

3005-163390-0000 AND BUT NEVER MIND THE REST OF HIS OUTFIT IT WAS JEST WILD BUT IT WAS AWFUL FUNNY
3005-163390-0001 THE PEOPLE MOST KILLED THEMSELVES LAUGHING AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE CAPERING AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HAWED TILL HE CAME BACK AND DONE IT OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM DO IT ANOTHER TIME

3005-163399-0015 SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I GOT TO RISK THE TRUTH
3005-163399-0016 I OPEN MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE HE COMES
3005-163399-0017 GENTLEMEN DON'T YOU SAY A WORD

3005-163399-0029 BING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG DOWN DE RIVER
3005-163399-0030 THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES DOWN IN THAT BOAT
3080-5032-0000 AND I AM HUGELY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MY LADY
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN BUT THE WORST OF HER
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUMOUR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE THE DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
3080-5032-0003 WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND GARLAND
3080-5032-0004 WELL THE BEST OF IT IS THAT I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CAN NOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGEST
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITHAL AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVE BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
3080-5032-0008 TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I WILL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS A SQUIRE OF DANE'S AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND TO SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0010 I THINK MY YOUNGEST BROTHER GOES DOWN WITH HIM
3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUT THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEAN YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASILY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAVE HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO READ YOUR LETTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0014 AND BESIDES I CAN GIVE YOU OTHERS
3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT EXCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0016 YOU'LL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY ACCEPT IT
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS A JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMOURS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBORS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN ON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU YE SHOULD HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAID BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0023 WE HAD HAD ANOTHER DEBATE BUT MUCH MORE CALMLY
3080-5032-0024 AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I DONE IT SINCE
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETERS
3080-5032-0026 HOW KINDLY DO I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHER IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
3080-5040-0000 WOULD IT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHOULD NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST A PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMISH
3080-5040-0003 I WONDER SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANYONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE IN BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTER TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
3080-5040-0008 MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGONE THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILLFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED
3080-5040-0009 YOU THINK I GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING
3080-5040-0010 BY THE NEXT I SHALL BE GOING INTO KENT AND MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR INTERCOURSE VERY MUCH
3080-5040-0011 HERE ARE SOME VERSES OF CARROLES TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE THEM
3080-5040-0012 I TOLD YOU IN MY LAST THAT MY SUFFOLK JOURNEY WAS LAID ASIDE AND THAT IN KENT HASTENED
3080-5040-0013 IF I DROWN BY THE WAY THIS WILL BE MY LAST LETTER AND LIKE A WILL I BEQUEATH ALL MY KINDNESS TO YOU IN IT WITH A CHARGE NEVER TO BESTOW IT UPON ANOTHER MISTRESS LEST MY GHOST RISE AGAIN AND HAUNT YOU
3080-5040-0014 INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUDGE FOR A MOST EXCELLENT SERVANT AND FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE
3080-5040-0015 BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THAT IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT INTEND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
3080-5040-0016 I DO NOT FIND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVE ME
3080-5040-0017 I AM CALLED UPON
3080-5040-0018 DIRECTED YOUR MASTER
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHID WHEN YOU PLEASE WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
3080-5040-0020 WE DARED NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS THAN THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING IT
3080-5040-0021 YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE THAT I ESCAPED DROWNING
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WRITE BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0023 HOW WELCOME YOU'LL BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CAN NOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGHED TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND STAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS WHEN WE HAVE TIME
3080-5040-0027 WHILE IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT A KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
3080-5040-0028 YOU BE SO GOOD NATURED
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND IS THE FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THUS WITH DISCOURSES OF THAT FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER OCCASION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS HER AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO THINK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASE CARD WITH NINE PEAS IN IT UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PATTLE INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
3331-159605-0001 THE MORE PROFESSIONS THE MORE CREDIT
3331-159605-0002 I HAVE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES
3331-159605-0004 WHAT A SPITEFUL THINGS I AM
3331-159605-0005 I CAN DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 LET ME SEE HOW COULD I BEGIN
3331-159605-0007 HE HAD KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATIONS ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOUR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THEY DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THE INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERYBODY
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLUTTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY ARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
3331-159605-0014 POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SIDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH A SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BLACKY AND BESS BUT COULD NOT RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FANNY THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DOCTOR BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASSA CHARLEY'S HAND MISS MAMMIE AND WALK PRETTY LIKE BILLY AND FLOSSIE SAID THE MAID
3331-159605-0019 AT THE STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOL BOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0021 SHE COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE ROCKS ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE THAT SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0025 THANK YOU NOW
3331-159605-0026 HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKED SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH BILLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE THE HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
3331-159605-0029 SO WHEN SHE MADE A LAST BUOYANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WILD LIKE LEVERLEY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANY THING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVOURITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNT FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 WORKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL BUT WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS SHE'LL KILL HIM
3331-159605-0035 OTHERWISE DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PODDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RABBITS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0038 DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS
3331-159605-0039 TRULY TRULY FAN
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRAYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID
3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
3331-159605-0042 I JUST GIVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO DON'T THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT SIDDY TATTLERS SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHANDLEMAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0046 I'M ODD YOU KNOW AND PREFERRED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WHITEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERYBODY WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND BUT THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SIDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL ALL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 I AM ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT'S THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I TRY TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0008 THANK HEAVEN FOR IT
3331-159609-0009 CRIED BILLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0010 POOR MAGGIE WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELLE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER AND ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATED THEIR RESPECTIVE VERUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARIE BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID FANNY TURNING HOPEFUL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST ENQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BARE THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WIND FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OVER A BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORES
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 ANNIE CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORKBASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY WOULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
3528-168656-0000 SHE HAS EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT IS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR THAT SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND SCHOOLGIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
3528-168656-0004 WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF FONTREVALE DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0006 SHE WOULD NOT SHOW THIS OBJECT TO ANYBODY
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED THE SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENT
3528-168656-0008 SOME UNIQUE CHAPLET SOME AUTHENTIC RELICS
3528-168656-0009 THEY LOST THEMSELVES INTO CONJECTURES
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO THE CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT THE DANCER IS LAUGHING WITH A SATANIC AIR
3528-168656-0012 MORAL LIFE CONQUERED BY THE COLIC
3528-168669-0000 THE PRIORESS RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON A CHAIR
3528-168669-0001 WE WILL PRESENT THE STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0002 FATHER FAUBENT
3528-168669-0003 REVEREND MOTHER YOU KNOW THE CHAPEL
3528-168669-0004 AND YOU HAD BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
3528-168669-0005 THERE IS THE STONE TO BE RAISED HEAVY
3528-168669-0006 A SLAP OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0007 THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT
3528-168669-0008 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR
3528-168669-0009 A WOMAN IS NEVER MAN
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DAME BABYLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLONUS HORSEES ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERLANUS HORSEES NEITHER DO I
3528-168669-0011 MARRIAGE CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCKYARD
3528-168669-0012 A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0013 CAN YOU GET A LEVER
3528-168669-0014 THERE IS A RING IN THAT STONE
3528-168669-0015 I WILL PUT A LEVER THROUGH IT
3528-168669-0016 THAT IS GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I WILL OPEN THAT VAULT
3528-168669-0017 WILL THAT BE ALL NOW
3528-168669-0018 GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS VERY REVEREND FATHER
3528-168669-0019 FERVENT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
3528-168669-0020 I AM HERE TO DO EVERYTHING YOU WISH
3528-168669-0021 AND TO HOLD YOUR PEACE ABOUT EVERYTHING YES ROBIN MOTHER
3528-168669-0022 WHEN A VAULT IS OPEN I WILL CLOSE IT AGAIN
3528-168669-0023 BUT BEFORE THAT WHAT REVERED MOTHER

3528-168669-0027 NOTHING COULD BE HEARD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN REALLY
3528-168669-0028 AND THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN MY DIRECTION THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0029 IT WAS OTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN HER CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER AH
3528-168669-0031 THE MOTHER HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW
3528-168669-0032 A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THAT DEAD ROOM MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0033 EY MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0034 WHAT DID YOU SAY
3528-168669-0035 I SAY MORE OFTEN MORE OFTEN WHAT

3528-168669-0037 BUT I DO NOT SAY MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0038 AT THIS MOMENT NINE O'CLOCK STRUCK
3528-168669-0039 AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT ALL HOURS PRAISED AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR SAID THE PRINCE
3528-168669-0040 IT CUT MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0041 FAUCHELWENT MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD
3528-168669-0042 IN HER LIFETIME HER CRUCIFIXION MADE CONVERTS AFTER HER DEATH SHE WILL PERFORM MIRACLES SHE WILL
3528-168669-0043 FATHER FAUVAIN THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0044 SHE RETAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE LAST MOMENT
3528-168669-0045 SHE GAVE HER LAST COMMANDS
3528-168669-0046 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HERSELF SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0047 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THE DEATH
3528-168669-0048 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORISON WHICH HE WAS FINISHING
3528-168669-0049 FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE AND WENT ON
3528-168669-0050 I HAVE CONSULTED ON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABOURING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT
3528-168669-0051 FORTUNATELY THE PRIORES COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT
3528-168669-0052 SHE CONTINUED FATHER FORVEN
3528-168669-0053 YES REVEREND BROTHER

3528-168669-0068 THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED TO BE BURIED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL NOT TO GO TO PROFANE EARTH TO REMAIN THERE IN DEATH WHERE SHE PRAYED WHILE LIVING SUCH WAS THE LAST WISH OF HER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0069 SHE ASKED IT OF US THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDING US
3528-168669-0070 BUT IS FORBIDDEN
3528-168669-0071 O I AM A STONE IN YOUR WALLS

3528-168669-0094 HOW WICKED PEOPLE ARE
3528-168669-0095 BY ORDER OF THE KING SIGNIFIES TO DAY BY ORDER OF THE CONVENTION

3528-168669-0130 I MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS UPON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THIS SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE TO PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERTY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS ARISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SUM TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THE SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0008 EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT IN POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUIT BY SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN A STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNING EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTES ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THERE ARE PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN O SIX
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMALLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER AND THEY CAN NOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF THE TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE FISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 ITIS
3538-142836-0024 AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE SPA IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MEN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 AND HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME A GIRL SAID THE HEAD
3538-163619-0004 AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURES SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH TO THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY COME IN SIGHT OF LAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAID SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY MOTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED A KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE PLAYED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONE MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT THEN THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BEARD AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVENFOLDS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOWLS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME TO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT I HAD SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE OFF ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH THE DISTIFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HEAD
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF ON THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD UPON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SIMDER LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND SINDER LAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID SINDER
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID SINDERLAND
3538-163622-0014 THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOOL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID SINDA LAD
3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRUNKS OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SINDALAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANY THING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE FOWL SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FOLE DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 IT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDER LADD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING OF THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT ON AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
3538-163624-0003 SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND SHOOT THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUDOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF BORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REGAN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON THE LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS FATHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGURD SAID THAT WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ON AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF THEM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY DOING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM THIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FAFFNER AND THEN STAFFER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED THEM TO ROAST FAFNER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNER IN A STEAK AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHALL TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRENHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 LYN BENHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUNDRAN WERE BATHING BRUNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRAN'S SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG WHILE I AM DEAD
367-130732-0000 LOBSTERS OR LOBSTERS
367-130732-0001 WHEN IT IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION IN ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMARY INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSISTS THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN
367-130732-0004 A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD WIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER AL NEUBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DOMONICO

367-130732-0012 I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COAST IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELIGHTFULLY AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
367-130732-0013 GOBY'S PASSED WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBIES AND BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PRESTIGE DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
367-130732-0015 GOBBY'S CRAB STEW
367-130732-0016 TAKE THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT THE FAT FROM THE SHELL

367-130732-0020 SERVE A CHAFING DISH WITH TOASTED CRACKERS OR THIN SLICES OF TOASTED BREAD
367-130732-0021 LOBSTER AND MINIATURE
367-130732-0022 SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE HOP BROW HAS BEEN MAKING A SPECIALITY OF THEM
367-130732-0023 THE BETTER CLASS RESTAURANTS HOWEVER WILL SERVE THEM IF YOU ORDER THEM
367-130732-0024 THIS IS A RECIPE FOR EIGHT PEOPLE AND IT IS WELL WORTH TRYING IF YOU ARE GIVING A DINNER OF IMPORTANCE

367-293981-0008 MINE WOULD SPEAK TOO SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT THAT IS NOT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT WHAT WE SEE IS THE ENCHANTED MOOR
367-293981-0009 THE OFFICER RETURNED TO HIM AND SAID WELL HOW GOES IT GOOD MAN
367-293981-0010 SANCHO GOT UP WITH PAIN ENOUGH IN HIS BONES AND WENT AFTER THE INNKEEPER IN THE DARK AND MEETING THE OFFICER WHO WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIS ENEMY HE SAID TO HIM SENOR WHOEVER YOU ARE DO US THE FAVOUR AND KINDNESS TO GIVE US A LITTLE ROSEMARY OIL SALT AND WINE FOR IT IS WONTED TO CURE ONE OF OUR BEST KNIGHTS ERRANT ON EARTH WHO LIES ON YONDER BED WOUNDED BY THE HANDS OF THE ENCHANTED MOOR THAT IS IN THIS INN

367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING HIM WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED IT DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER
367-293981-0014 IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT REPLIED SANCHO WOE BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KINDRED WHY DID YOU LET ME TASTE IT
367-293981-0015 SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THIS KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU BY THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOU SATISFACTION AND REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRES
367-293981-0016 AND THIS IS AN INN SAID DON QUIXOTE
367-293981-0017 A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE SAID THE INNKEEPER
367-293981-0018 THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLINDED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW ADVENTURE WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS SQUIRE WHO UTTERED THEM
367-293981-0019 HE SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT WAS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
367-293981-0020 SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THAT BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
3764-168670-0000 THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLED GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
3764-168670-0001 JESUS HAD WAKED UP
3764-168670-0002 JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED HIM NEAR THE FIRE
3764-168670-0003 YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT THE LADY'S HOUSE I SHALL COME TO FETCH YOU
3764-168670-0004 EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED AND NOTHING IT IS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
3764-168670-0005 I HAD PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE GOT OUT
3764-168670-0006 THAT'S WHERE THE DIFFERENCE LIES
3764-168670-0007 IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THAT CHILD YOU WILL CARRY HER OUT
3764-168670-0008 SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE I ANSWER FOR THAT
3764-168670-0009 FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN JEAN VALJEAN
3764-168670-0010 YOU UNDERSTAND MOTHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE IT
3764-168670-0011 JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYES AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RAVEN
3764-168670-0012 FAUCHELEVENT ON
3764-168670-0013 IT IS TO MORROW I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECTS YOU
3764-168670-0014 AND HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR A SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE COMMUNITY
3764-168670-0015 THAT THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN A VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
3764-168670-0016 THAT THE PRIORESS AND VOCAL MOTHERS INTENDED TO FULFIL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
3764-168670-0017 THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THE CELL RAISE THE STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE IN THE VAULT
3764-168670-0018 AND THEN BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER THE EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0019 WHAT IS THE EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0020 ASK JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
3764-168670-0021 WHAT COFFIN WHAT ADMIRATION
3764-168670-0022 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS IF A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER HIS CHAIR YOU
3764-168670-0023 YOU KNOW FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID BROTHER CRUCIFIXION IS DEAD
3764-168670-0024 AND I AND FATHER MADELEINE IS BURIED R
3764-168670-0025 YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN MOTHER MADELEINE
3764-168670-0026 THIS OFFERS THE MEANS TO GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
3764-168670-0027 HOW LONG WAS THE COFFIN SIX FEET
3764-168670-0028 IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH WHAT
3764-168670-0029 THE CHURCH IN THE STREET THOUGH THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
3764-168670-0030 HAVE YOU THE KEYS TO THESE TWO DOORS
3764-168670-0031 NOW I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKERS MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET THE COFFEE
3764-168670-0033 WHO NAILS UP THE COFFIN DO
3764-168670-0034 WHO SPREADS THE PAIL OVER IT
3764-168670-0035 NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER THE BED ROOM THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
3764-168670-0036 COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THAT ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN EVERYBODY IS ASLEEP
3764-168670-0037 ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK OF THE AFTERNOON
3764-168670-0038 I SHALL BE HUNGRY I'LL BRING YOU SOMETHING
3764-168670-0039 YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP IN THE OVEN AT TWO O'CLOCK
3764-168670-0040 FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS FINGERS JOINTS BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
3764-168670-0041 BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS ON A PLANK
3764-168670-0042 JEAN VALJEAN HAS BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS THAN THIS
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAD BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
3764-168670-0044 WHAT DOES A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A CURE
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BAIL OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK ON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0047 A MAN WHO WAS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE
3764-168670-0048 WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO A CAT TO COME IN
3764-168670-0049 THE OVER PRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
3764-168670-0050 BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S CALMNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU WERE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
3764-168670-0052 AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUT THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0053 I WILL FOLLOW THAT IS MY BUSINESS
3764-168670-0054 THE HOUSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKERS MEN KNOT A ROPE ROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0055 THE PRIEST SAYS THE PRAYERS MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0056 OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER
3764-168670-0057 THAT IS SETTLED THOUGHT FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL GO WELL
3764-168671-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAINE PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEARS
3764-168671-0001 HIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
3764-168671-0002 A MORNING COACH IN WHICH CAN BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
3764-168671-0003 BEHIND IT CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF THE LABORER WHO LIMPED ALONG
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING AND SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THE CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES
3764-168671-0006 DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT THE CLOUDS WERE DESERTING IT
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VOUGERG IT HINTED AT POVERTY PER LA CHAISE IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PERE LA CHAISE IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNISED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0009 THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN INTO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENAL OFFENCE IN OUR SIGHT
3764-168671-0010 IT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE THE DUTY
3764-168671-0011 THE NUNS HAD ADMITTED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
3764-168671-0012 IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AND INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0013 MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MEN BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELF
3764-168671-0014 A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCESS
3764-168671-0015 FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND A HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0016 JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE PAINFUL TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0017 WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE IS A MERE NOTHING
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESTION
3764-168671-0019 HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM AND MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
3764-168671-0020 THE PROVISION FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF A LABOURING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0022 THAT MAN REPLIED THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0023 A GRAVE DIGGER YES
3764-168671-0024 YOU AY
3764-168671-0025 FATHER MASTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
3764-168671-0026 FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS BUT THE GRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE
3764-168671-0027 IT IS TRUE THAT GRAVE DIGGERS DO DIE THEMSELVES
3764-168671-0028 HE HAS HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STAMMER
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER MATIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LUNOIR IS HERE'S A JUG OF RED WINE
3764-168671-0031 BUT YOURE A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
3764-168671-0032 ARE YOU NOT COMRADES WE'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
3764-168671-0033 A MAN REPLIED
3764-168671-0034 SHE LIMPED MORE OUT OF ANXIETY THAN FROM INFIRMITY
3764-168671-0035 THE GRAVE DIGGER WALKED ON IN FRONT OF THEM
3764-168671-0036 FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED CRELLER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALK HE MUTTERED
3764-168671-0038 MONSIEUR FATHER MASTIAN IS DEAD
3764-168671-0039 THE MAN REPLIED QUICKLY
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTEBOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MASTIENNE'S TURN FATHER MASTIEN DIED
3764-168671-0041 STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT IT IS
3764-168671-0042 YOU ARE THE PEASANT I AM A PARISIAN
3764-168671-0043 FAUCHELVENT THOUGHT I AM LOST
3764-168671-0044 THERE WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM A SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUN'S CORNER
3764-168671-0045 AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO WAS TURNING A PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0046 UNFORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE BRITINNIUM TOWN HALL
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES IN CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0049 SO YOU ARE A GRAVE DIGGER THEN
3764-168671-0050 RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT THE BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS
3764-168671-0051 HERE A MARK BECOMES NECESSARY
3764-168671-0052 FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053 THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH A SMILE
3764-168671-0054 I MUST EAT
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT TILL I AWAKE
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT IF I SHOULD ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT
3997-180294-0002 WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS ON THE DOOR WRETCH
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF I DO
3997-180294-0005 GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING A SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNCIL OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO A LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VALE
3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNT UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
3997-180294-0011 THEY LIVE BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PASTS TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0013 I KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF TO GIVE
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABOURERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRY FOR HELP
3997-180294-0015 IT IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVE SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES HIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAISANCE
3997-180294-0018 WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MUCH GAIETY
3997-180294-0019 THE WOMAN BECOMES THAT MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 WHY WHY
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THE FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT A VAUDEVILLE
3997-180294-0023 COME DURING THE THIRD IN TRACT
3997-180294-0024 THE BOXES FOLLOWED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY THE STABLE BOX
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD A DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0027 DOES SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND GOING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 YOU SHOULD GO TO BED SHE SAID WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0030 AT HOME
3997-180294-0031 YOU STILL LOVED ME CAN YOU ASK
3997-180294-0032 YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
3997-180294-0033 NONE THE LESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GET INTO A CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0000 I HAD NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
3997-180297-0001 YOU IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ALIVE
3997-180297-0003 DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT HIM ATTENTIVELY
3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR CONSTANCE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I WOULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MUST DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
3997-180297-0007 WAS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
3997-180297-0008 IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER
3997-180297-0009 HONESTLY DID YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
3997-180297-0010 I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WILL NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0011 GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
3997-180297-0012 I LISTENED AND GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELLOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRES HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAD FANTASTIC DESIRES AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER A PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 THEY NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017 YOU STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEM LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER DO I GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUC IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0021 I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH YOU OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVED AND HEARD WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH THE LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0024 MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
3997-180297-0025 MARGUERITE DREW A LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID
3997-180297-0026 HERE IT IS I HAVE BOUGHT IT BACK
3997-180297-0027 I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT
3997-180297-0028 LOOK HERE PRUDENCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID MARGARET
3997-180297-0029 HE WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE HIM
3997-180297-0030 ONE HAS TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT
3997-180297-0031 I EMBRACED MARGUERITE UNTIL SHE WAS ALMOST STIFLING
3997-182399-0000 OL MISTER BUZZARD GRINNED
3997-182399-0001 IT SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER STORY
3997-182399-0002 HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK HAIRED COUSIN OF OLD MISTER BUZZARD VERY CURIOUS INDEED
3997-182399-0003 ANYWAY HE WILL FIND OUT
3997-182399-0004 PLEASE MISSUS BUZZARD PLEASE TELL US THE STORY HE BEGGED
3997-182399-0005 NOW MISTER BUZZARD IS NATURALLY GOOD NATURED AND ACCOMMODATING AND WHEN PETER BEGGED SO HARD HE JUST COULDN'T FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO REFUSE
3997-182399-0006 WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN GRANDPA BUZZARD HAD HIS LITTLE FALLING OUT WITH OLD KING EAGLE AND DONE FLIES SO HIGH HE SCORCHED THE FEATHERS OFF IN HIS HEAD HE HAD A COUSIN DID GRANDPAPA BUZZARD AND THIS COUSIN WAS JUST NATURALLY LAZY AND NO COUNT
3997-182399-0007 LIKE MOST PEOPLE HE USED TO MAKE A REGULAR NUISANCE OF HIMSELF POKING HIS NOSE INTO EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS AND NEVER TENDING TO HIS OWN
3997-182399-0008 WASN'T ANYTHING GOING ON THAT THIS TRIFLING MEMBER OF THE BUZZARD FAMILY DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT AND MEDDLED IN HE COULD ASK MORE QUESTIONS THAN PETER RABBIT CAN AND ANYBODY THAT CAN DO THAT HAS GOT TO ASK A LOT

4198-12281-0003 BY THE VIRTUE OF GOD WHY DO NOT YOU SING PANNIERS FAREWELL VINTAGE HAS DONE
4198-12281-0004 BY THE BELLY OF SAINT JAMES WHAT SHALL WE POOR DEVILS DRINK A WHILE
4198-12281-0005 LORD GOD DAMI HE POTUM
4198-12281-0006 LET THEM BE CARRIED TO PRISON FOR TROUBLING THE DIVINE SERVICE
4198-12281-0007 WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN ADVENT AND ALL THE WINTER
4198-12281-0008 HARK YOU MY MASTERS YOU THAT LOVE THE WINE COP'S BODY FOLLOW ME FOR SAINT ANTHONY BURNED ME AS FREELY AS A FAGGOT THEY GET LEAVE TO TASTE ONE DROP OF THE LIQUOR THAT WILL NOT NOW COME AND FIGHT FOR RELIEF OF THE VINE
4198-12281-0009 TO OTHERS AGAIN HE UNJOINTED THE SPINDELS OR KNUCKLES OF THE NECK DISFIGURED THEIR CHAPS GHASHED THEIR FACES MADE THEIR CHEEKS HANG FLAPPING ON THEIR CHIN AND SO SWINGED AND BELAMMED THEM THAT THEY FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM LIKE HAY BEFORE A MORE
4198-12281-0010 TO SOME WITH THE SMART SOUS ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDRIFTS WAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOME PUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
4198-12281-0011 THAT IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER ONE SAW
4198-12281-0012 O THE HOLY LADY NITI SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTUS O OUR LADY OF SUCCOURS SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP
4198-12281-0013 SOME DIED WITHOUT SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE WITHOUT DYING SOME DIED IN SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE OF DYING
4198-12281-0014 CAN YOU TELL WITH WHAT INSTRUMENT THEY DID IT
4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEAN TIME FRIAR JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHURST BY THE ADHERENCE OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SHORDURAS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
4198-61336-0003 TIGLATH PALLISER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE EURIAN ARMY IN KOUMAC
4198-61336-0004 A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF THE DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING SHARDORUS WHO LEAPED FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST URTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTHERN SYRIA
4198-61336-0007 THE SIFTI MATTI ILIU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHAWDORRUS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TIGLATH BLEEZER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERN LANDS WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0010 ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATTILU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE HEBREWS CAME IN CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA
4198-61336-0012 ITS FALLS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 JEHO THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARDS HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHELIM
4198-61336-0015 THIS USURPER HELD SWAY AT SAMARIA FOR ONLY A MONTH
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MANYHEIM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0017 TEGLATH PELIZER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTHEAST
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD PUT TO THE SWARD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS URATU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLATH BLIZER RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0021 MANYHEIM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PECAHIAH
4198-61336-0022 JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT HIS INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0023 HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR THEIR IDOLATRIES AND CRIED
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YE ME AND YOU SHALL LIVE HAVE YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL
4198-61336-0025 THAT REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES SHALL PERISH
4198-61336-0026 WASRAEL WAS ALSO DEALT WITH
4198-61336-0027 HE SWEPT TO ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0028 THE PHILISTINES AND THE ARABIANS OF THE DESERTS WERE ALSO SUBDUED
4198-61336-0029 INVADED BABYLONIA
4198-61336-0030 UGENZER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITAL SCIPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0000 AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT OF THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THE BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO ERROR
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE HIM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME THE LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BENDENELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR IF HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0005 I ASK NO FURTHER REWARD FOR MY LABORS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THESE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED ON HIS FAVOUR TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0008 I BEGGED HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM I HAD TAKEN IN
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GIORGIO DA CORTONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0010 GIORGIO CAME FOR THEM HIS HOUSE
4294-14317-0011 I HOPED TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUC ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LANDI WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGEELLO
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTOR'S CRAFT
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVEN MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-14317-0016 AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALL ME THE NEW SCULPTOR
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE AT HEART I REACHED MY HOME
4294-32859-0000 WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRUNK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THE COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDIN AND RETCH'S PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE THE LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THE VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE MAN WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED OH ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU O SWORD HE QUOTH
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS ON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRED HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNABLE TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDEST REND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS THAT SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE OGRE SAID THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW THE GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US FROM THE OGRE'S MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THIS SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS READING
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME A KEYHOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORD THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING ABOUT HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL IN ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNCILLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO WOULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT ETHEL REED HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE ISOUD
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVED LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE RECOVERED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF DEATH PAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO SEARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS STATES OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON ABSORBED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND WALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER GOLD IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A CLOAK AND MY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 IT WILL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU KNOW GERMAN
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PAID WORK AND ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHES DEALER IS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCH MAKER'S
4294-9934-0022 HE BROUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HALLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH WAS TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAYS MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR ONE HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLE THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORWARD TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THIS MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE PROCEEDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KATY
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATES SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCE WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROGRESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
4350-10919-0009 YES THAT IS AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKI BRIDGE DONE OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED HOW IT IS
4350-10919-0012 OH WELL I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW OUT A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED AS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH FOR LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0015 THE FAIRY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING OUT REMINISCENCES
4350-10919-0017 AND THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THESE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 OH TIME'S UP ALREADY HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THIS CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 O NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY A DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ANSWERED AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECTION IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THAT IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THIS CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THAT QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD AND TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS IF SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KATY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THEIR EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-9170-0001 IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTEREST FOR THE INTEREST OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNEXION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORTAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY WAS BODILY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ENEMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS A BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANY THING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT CAN NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THESE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARD OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMED STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY A STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO ETERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NOT MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITIES OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMITS BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-9170-0021 A MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 SO IT IS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WOULD SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TODAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT IN PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THE ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NATIVE BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORTUNES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED ON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICES
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAVE MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THEIR INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOUR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS A MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERY THING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER BUT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF EDUCATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THIS STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 AND THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAD MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WILL BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH HIS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0055 IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF A STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID UPON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF A WEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH THE GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAY YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CARD JACK AND SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 KNOW WHO NEEDS A JOB BAN THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS
4852-28311-0003 OKAY HE SAID
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK EM YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN EMS STREET
4852-28311-0006 HE ADMITTED I DID
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED BEHIND HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED IN THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT GRACE WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BITCHY AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED TO HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE CORRIDOR
4852-28311-0013 O SHUCKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON A HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE THE LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARDS THE BACK AT THE BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON TO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH A JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND SOMETHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF A HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYES AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTRE THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREAT GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME AND BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYBODY GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SUFFER
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOKE HIM FROM THIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOME ONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY ROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0003 A HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0004 MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THAT SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNERS TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOUT THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0007 CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY ARE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0008 CHRIS SWALLOWED HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
4852-28312-0009 YES SIR SAID
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNEW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0011 HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MIND
4852-28312-0012 JAKI HARRIS'S NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE BOX WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTY STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOUR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THERE IT MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE IS GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALLUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE ATAPHIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018 THE ROOM SEEMS OVERLY STILL
4852-28312-0019 AND IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28312-0020 THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE SUNLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHERE'S THE FREEWAY
4852-28312-0022 WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKE STACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023 THE WAREHOUSES ARE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOWS IN EVERY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMP LIT STREET
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE WOMEN'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
4852-28312-0027 THE COURTYARD WAS SCARCELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS PLANTED ON THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0029 A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE A FLANGED COURTYARD
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED TO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS THE POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28319-0000 A LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
4852-28319-0001 HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28319-0002 CHRIS THEREFORE THRUST HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLD FISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHOULD I DO FIRST
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU'VE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSE THEY CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK
4852-28319-0007 MISTER HOOKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0008 THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER RICKER SAID START AT ONCE
4852-28319-0009 THIS SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORD
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT LESS
4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR ONE THE RETURN
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE HAD CURVED UP POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0014 THEN ALL AT ONCE AN IDEA CAME TO CHRIS
4852-28319-0015 IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THAT BOY COME TO LIFE
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURES ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0017 AND HOW DID ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
4852-28319-0018 CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISS WICKER'S DOOR
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY HE RESUMED HIS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE INCREASING IN STORM
4852-28319-0021 THUS CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY
4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT A PROPER TIME
4852-28319-0023 MISTER WORKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKY AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCION FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOORS SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
4852-28319-0025 IT WAS AS IF THAT STIFFNESS MELTED
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES THE LINEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED THEN LET THE BOUQUET FALL
4852-28330-0000 THEY WENT TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY EDWARD JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
4852-28330-0004 THE MIRABELL WAS NEARING TAHITI
4852-28330-0005 WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON
4852-28330-0006 CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0007 CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINNEEL WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THIS MIGHT DO NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT THEM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CAN NOT SAY I DO
4852-28330-0012 THAT SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY
4852-28330-0013 HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDE WAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM
4852-28330-0014 WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAND
4852-28330-0015 HIS SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SO
4852-28330-0017 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED INTO ITS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0018 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THIS SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0019 CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME HAD UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0020 WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THE TIME SIR CHRIS OUGHT TO ASK
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF SHIP AND CREW KNOW IT
4852-28330-0022 I SHALL SAY THAT YOU WERE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER HOOKER HAD CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR
4852-28330-0025 THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN A LITTLE WHILE
533-1066-0000 WHEN CHURCHYARDS YARN
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSAND OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
533-1066-0002 I'M SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEMED TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
533-1066-0003 FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELORS HALL IN THE LODGE
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOATED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0005 MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UPSTAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TONIGHT
533-1066-0006 I HAVE NONE I SAID SHARPLY
533-1066-0007 I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU WOULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL
533-1066-0008 THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WILL BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT
533-1066-0009 SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCCURRED HE SAID
533-1066-0010 PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANY THING
533-1066-0011 LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
533-1066-0012 THEY WERE TALKING COFIULENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
533-1066-0013 THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0014 I ASKED NO QUESTION
533-1066-0015 ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STUART WHEN HE RUN INTO A WIRE FENCE
533-1066-0016 I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I EXPECT
533-1066-0017 THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHEN THEY FINALLY CAME TO A HALT
533-1066-0018 I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MOMENT EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A CHEERFUL SPOT
533-1066-0019 IN SPITE OF HIMSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN SHARPLY
533-1066-0020 IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO HANDLED SPADES
533-1066-0021 THE DOCTOR KEPT A CLEAN LOOK OUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED
533-1066-0022 THERE IS ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY
533-1066-0023 A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT TIGING THEM UP
533-1066-0024 I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND WENT DOWN
533-131556-0000 BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY COME
533-131556-0001 FOR NONE COULD ENDURE ME AS HE HAS DONE O
533-131556-0002 THE WORLD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO RESPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
533-131556-0004 I HAD DONE WELL TO RECORD THEM SO MINUTELY
533-131556-0005 THEY HAD UNDERTAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK
533-131556-0006 I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CAN NOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT
533-131556-0007 UPON PERUSING THESE SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP
533-131556-0008 YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND I'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT
533-131556-0009 YOU'LL OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE
533-131556-0010 HA YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS
533-131556-0011 IF I ARE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE
533-131556-0012 I ENJOY A MOONLIGHT RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THE SHRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESORTS
533-131556-0013 SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER CHEEK AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
533-131556-0014 I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANY THING MORE TO SAY
533-131556-0015 YES SIR
533-131556-0016 SUPPOSED I DO
533-131556-0017 SHE PAUSED AN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW
533-131556-0018 I CAN NOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
533-131556-0019 IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR DEBTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
533-131556-0020 I WILL NOT TELL HIM
533-131556-0021 GIVE ME NO THANKS IT IS FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I REFRAIN
533-131556-0022 AND MELLICENT WILL YOU TELL HER
533-131556-0023 I WOULD NOT FORMUCH THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF HER RELATION
533-131556-0024 YOU USE OUR WORDS MISSUS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU
533-131556-0025 HOW DARE YOU MENTION THIS NAME TO ME
533-131562-0000 IT SEEMS VERY INTERESTING LOVE SAID HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO WHERE I STOOD WRINGING MY HANDS IN SILENT RAGE AND ANGUISH BUT IT'S RATHER LONG I'LL LOOK AT IT SOME OTHER TIME AND MEANTIME I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KISS MY DEAR WHAT KISS
533-131562-0001 THE KEYS OF YOUR CABINET DESK DRAWER AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HANDS
533-131562-0002 THE KEY OF MY DESK IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
533-131562-0003 NOW THEN SNEERED HE WE MUST HAVE THE CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY
533-131562-0004 AND PUTTING THE KEYS IN HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY
533-131562-0005 THAT IS ALL REPLIED THE MASTER AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
533-131562-0006 MISSUS HUNTINGDON THEN WENT UPSTAIRS
533-131562-0007 MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE'S VERY DEVIL FOR A SPITE
533-131562-0008 I DIDN'T SAY I'D BROKEN IT DID I
533-131562-0009 I SHALL PUT YOU UP A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE FOR YOUR OWN PRIVATE EXPENSES AND YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ANY MORE ABOUT MY CONCERNS I SHALL LOOK OUT FOR A STEWARD MY DEAR I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO THE TEMPTATION
533-131562-0010 AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREEBS MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO ON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN
533-131562-0011 WHAT A GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE YOU MADE NOW MISTER HUNTINGDON
533-131562-0012 HAVE I INTENDED TO DEFRAUD YOU
533-131562-0013 NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS BUT IT'S BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATIONS
533-131562-0014 HERE BENSON ENTERED WITH CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENTLY TRIUMPHING IN MY DESPAIR
533-131562-0015 I KNOW THAT DAY AFTER DAY SUCH FEELING WILL RETURN UPON ME
533-131562-0016 I TRY TO LOOK AT HIM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT IT WILL CLEAVE TO THE DUST
533-131564-0000 VAIN HOPES I FEAR
533-131564-0001 MISTER AND MISSUS HUTTERSLEY HAVE BEEN STAYING AT THE GROVE A FORTNIGHT AND AS MISSUS HARGRAVE IS STILL ABSENT AND THE WEATHER WAS REMARKABLY FINE I NEVER PASSED A DAY WITHOUT SEEING MY TWO FRIENDS MILICENT AND ESTHER EITHER THERE OR HERE
533-131564-0002 NO UNTIL YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT HIM HOME
533-131564-0003 I CAN'T YOU DON'T WANT HIM DID YOU
533-131564-0004 IT IS A RESOLUTION YOU WERE FORMED LONG AGO
533-131564-0005 WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF THE LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS THOUGH WE CAN'T RESPECT HIM
533-131564-0006 NO I'D RATHER BE LIKE MYSELF AS I AM
533-131564-0007 NEVER MIND MY PLAIN SPEAKING SAYS I IT IS FROM THE BEST OF MOTIVES

533-131564-0013 NOT FOR SHE'S ONLY FIVE AND TWENTY
533-131564-0014 WHAT COULD YOU MAKE OF ME AND THE CHILDREN TO BE SURE THAT WAS HURT TO DEATH BETWEEN THEM
533-131564-0015 I KNOW THEY ARE BLESS HIM
533-131564-0016 SHE FOLLOWED ME INTO THE LIBRARY
533-131564-0017 I SOUGHT OUT AND PUT INTO HIS HANDS TWO OF MILLICENT'S LETTERS ONE DATED FROM LONDON AND WRITTEN DURING ONE OF HIS WILDEST SEASONS OF RECKLESS DISSIPATION THE OTHER IN THE COUNTRY DURING A LUCID INTERVAL
533-131564-0018 THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMS B AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENUOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON THE OTHER MAN'S SHOULDERS
533-131564-0019 I'VE BEEN A CURSED RASCAL GOD KNOWS SAID HE AS HE GAVE IT AN HEARTY SQUEEZE BUT YOU SEE IF I DON'T MAKE AMENDS FOR IT DAMN ME IF I DON'T
533-131564-0020 IF YOU INTEND TO REFORM INVOKE GOD'S BLESSING HIS MERCY IN HIS AID NOT HIS CURSE
533-131564-0021 GOD HELP ME THEN I'M SURE I NEED IT
533-131564-0022 WHERE IS MILLICENT
533-131564-0023 NAY NOT I SAID HE TURNING AROUND AND PUSHING TOWARDS ME
533-131564-0024 MILICENT FLEW TO ME OVERWHELMING WITH GRATITUDE
533-131564-0025 CRIED SHE I COULDN'T HAVE INFLUENCED HIM I AM SURE BY ANYTHING THAT I COULD HAVE SAID
533-131564-0026 YOU'VE NEVER TRIED ME MILLY SAID HE
533-131564-0027 AFTER THAT THEY WILL RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY HOME
5442-32873-0000 CAPTAIN LAKE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE A LONDON DANDIE
5442-32873-0001 THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND A WILD LURE IN HIS YELLOW EYES RACHAEL SAT DOWN
5442-32873-0002 A SLAVE ONLY THINKS A SLAVE
5442-32873-0003 OH FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL IS A DREAM
5442-32873-0004 O FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL
5442-32873-0005 STANLEY STANLEY IT WOULD BE MERCY TO KILL ME SHE BROKE OFF AGAIN
5442-32873-0006 BRIGHT AND GNATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH A BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF THE SAGE HER PILLOW SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
5442-32873-0007 WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TOILET BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
5442-32873-0008 THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE PROCESS
5442-32873-0009 THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THICK SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM
5442-32873-0010 THEN SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS
5442-32873-0011 RACHAEL LEAK RACHEL LAKE WHAT ARE YOU NOW
5442-32873-0012 I LL STAY HERE THAT IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-32873-0013 HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGETT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0014 LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKIN'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WILDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOLL CART FOR MIKE BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOLL CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
5442-32873-0015 BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LINE WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARD THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGDEN
5442-32873-0016 HERE WERE THE FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
5442-32873-0017 LOSE NO TIME I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A CRUMB
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STUCK ON HIS GREASY WIDE AWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOG CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOODNIGHT TAMAR
5442-41168-0000 THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COURSE SERGY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHALS OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR OTTO A BALLOT
5442-41168-0004 WE SHED OUR BLOOD TO OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NOT CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE'S NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 VOTES PLEASE PEACE
5442-41168-0007 THEY EXPRESSED A MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOUT FLEROV SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SERDYA IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO GET A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THIS AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY TO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT BAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAVE WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED A SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JURED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH A QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0014 SODY IVANOVITCH FROWNED
5442-41168-0015 THAT IS THE MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN DECISION HE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0017 A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETY EIGHT
5442-41168-0018 SANG UP THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
5442-41168-0019 THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO KNOTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX
5442-41168-0020 BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERORS
5442-41168-0021 IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMAN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT THIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 IF THEY ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE
5442-41168-0024 AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE SIDE DOOR
5442-41168-0025 THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO ELECTION
5442-41168-0026 TWO GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNETKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT PHEROV TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMEN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID ABOUT HIM
5442-41169-0002 HE'S A BLACKGUARD
5442-41169-0003 I TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
5442-41169-0004 THESE WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY LIKE CHAMPAGNE
5442-41169-0006 LAST YEAR IN OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S
5442-41169-0007 OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LAND OWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
5442-41169-0008 WHY WHAT WAS THERE TO UNDERSTAND
5442-41169-0009 THERE'S NO MEANING IN IT AT ALL
5442-41169-0010 THEN ONE MUST KEEP UP CONNECTIONS
5442-41169-0011 IT IS A MORAL OBLIGATION OF A SORT
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE IS ONE'S OWN INTERESTS
5442-41169-0013 THEY ARE PROPRIETORS OF THE SOD BUT WE ARE THE LANDOWNERS
5442-41169-0014 THAT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE A TREE THAT'S STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND HOW IS YOUR HAND DOING
5442-41169-0017 BUT ONE'S WORK IS THROWN FOR NOTHING
5442-41169-0018 OH WELL ONE DOES WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0019 AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOWS AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES IT
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASLIEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN A LIME TREE
5442-41169-0023 HERE YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BARK
5442-41169-0024 YOU'RE MARRIED I'VE HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER
5442-41169-0025 IT'S RATHER STRANGE HE WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THE LAND OWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MOUSTACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR POGS FOR TIMBER
5442-41169-0028 SAID EVAN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE'S THE CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDERED AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A RETURN TOO AT A SINGLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME TO THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HERMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANER
5484-24317-0002 SHE COULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OBSERVATION
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THIS DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTLES HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH HAD AROUSED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MUST HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH SHE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMANN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMATIUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENAU
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECT DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELL CHILLED AMONG THOSE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICHKO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENOT'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSMACHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THAT KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HARMON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES AND TIRING WOMEN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISE ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMINTAS THE LIEGE CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLIS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSENAUD IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT WAITING FROM THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR RETURNED HERMANN
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENAU HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYES HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED HIS STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HERMANN LISTENED TO THE PAIR IN SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENAU ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRATEZ HERMANN'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMEANOUR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED A FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES ON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMAN'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU ARE STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNARS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NO IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND AS YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMAN PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 IS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO IS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET THIS SUDDEN END AS A BOOM FROM THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0005 DID HE NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AFFECT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMANN WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTLES AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A DEITY
5484-24318-0010 YES IT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE LOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS DEMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERRIMANN IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU INTO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPA SILENCED HER WITH A GRAVE EXPLANATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURNED THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHTING GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PILASTER THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVE YOU ALWAYS
5484-24318-0021 DAPHNE ASKED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMANN WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORKER MYRTLEUS
5484-24318-0024 WHAT A DREADFUL ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU
5484-24318-0025 AND I FOOL BLINDED ALSO IN MIND WOULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERY THING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL AND PALLIATE NOTHING
5484-24318-0027 SO CAIUS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF A WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMINETES THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROBED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE IN WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS DUE
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES ROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERMANN
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATULUS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HEREMON
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISES OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOR TO MYRTELUS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FESTAL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMPS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THESE GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST
5764-299665-0001 BECAUSE HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND MYSELF
5764-299665-0002 WHY ANY PRAYER WAS EVER ANSWERED
5764-299665-0003 WHY DID HE CREATE THIS INTELLECTUAL INFERIOR
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HOPELESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0005 ARE FAILURES UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0006 IS IT RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH A LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SEWED FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0008 IS THE GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0009 DID THIS GOD ALLOW THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0010 DID HE ILLO TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0011 CAN WE CONCEIVE OF THE DEVIL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DIVORT HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WORLD WHERE LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NERVE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
5764-299665-0015 FEAR BUILDS A ALTAR AND OFFERS THE SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0016 FEAR ERECTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MEN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0017 LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT HIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0018 CAN WE SAY HE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
5764-299665-0019 CAN WE SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDURETH FOR EVER
5764-299665-0020 DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSAND OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0021 WAS THEIR GOODNESS WAS THEIR WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0022 OUGHT THE SUPERIOR RACE TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT INFERIOR
5764-299665-0023 MOST PEOPLE CLINGING TO THE SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0024 IF THEY GAVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE ANOTHER
5764-299665-0025 WHAT IS THE POWER
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES TO EXPERIENCE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE CAME TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0028 HE HAS TRIED THE ROAD AND KNOWS THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPED IT WITH ITS DIMPLED HAND
5764-299665-0030 THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAVE TAUGHT THE CHILD A LESSON
5764-299665-0031 IT IS THE RESULT
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY AND OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0033 THEY LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS
5764-299665-0034 THEY ARE PRIZED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
5764-299665-0035 THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MORTAL
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OR THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MEMBERS
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAVE SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LOVE
5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THOSE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0039 THIS IMAGINATION IS CULTIVATED
5764-299665-0040 A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN PLACE OF ANOTHER
5764-299665-0041 THAT SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
5764-299665-0042 A MAN JUDGES HIMSELF
5764-299665-0043 IN THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0044 HE HAS DECEIVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HES CHRISTIANITY DUNGOD
5764-299665-0046 WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAD RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY OR AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN WITHOUT RELIGION
5764-299665-0049 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0050 WHAT DOES CHRISTIANITY DO FOR THEM
5764-299665-0051 THEY HATED LEISURE
5764-299665-0052 THEY MUFFLED ALL THE BEDS OF GLADNESS
5764-299665-0053 THE RELIGION OF A PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED CURSE
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEVE THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN RECEIVING THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT
5764-299665-0058 HAD THE BIBLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES HAD FAILED
5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ARMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
5764-299665-0061 RELIGION HAD NEVER MADE MEN FREE
5764-299665-0062 IT HAS NEVER MADE A MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
5764-299665-0063 ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARER MODEST THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0064 CAN WE CURE DISEASES BY SUPPLICATION
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR HORROR AS ALMS
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT THIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE CORNED THE STONES
5764-299665-0068 THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE ABASEMENT
5764-299665-0069 IF WE BUILD WE MUST BEGIN AT A BOTTOM
5764-299665-0070 I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER STONES
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST THING IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNERSTONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE ONE END TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAVE BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0075 I KNOW WHAT I THINK
5764-299665-0076 EVERY EVENT HAS
5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED WOULD NOT
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHAINED RACE AND THE CAMP BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
5764-299665-0079 WE KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0080 WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANY THING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE PATH THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELLED
5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF ADVANCE THEY HAD BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMAN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAD THE REFORMERS FAILED
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPENDED ON THE LORD ON LUCK AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATHED THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0087 FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE Y
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PRODUCED WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
5764-299665-0089 MUST THE WORLD FOREVER REMAIN A VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CAN NOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE A BURDEN AND CURSES WHY
5764-299665-0091 PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEAD
5764-299665-0092 LAWS CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
5764-299665-0093 THIS CAN NOT BE DONE BY TALK OR EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0094 THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF A WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0095 IT FREES WOMEN
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME WILL BE COUNTLESS
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE BOLTS AND BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE
6070-63485-0000 THERE DONE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOW KEY TO THE CHOUETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE

6070-86744-0015 I WILL CONFESS TO YOU ALBERT SAID FRANZ THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0016 DID YOU EVER MEET HIM PREVIOUSLY TO COMING THITHER
6070-86744-0017 ON MY HONOUR THEN LISTEN TO ME
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY ON THE FIRST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAM AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YACHT SEEN IN THE DISTANT HORIZON DRIVING UNDER FULL SAIL TOWARD PORTO VECCHIO
6070-86744-0019 THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPAS IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86744-0020 BUT SAID FRANCE THE CORSICAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSEL
6070-86744-0021 WHY REALLY THE THING SEEMED TO ME SIMPLE ENOUGH
6070-86744-0022 TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DOES HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT WERE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELLOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINGED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY
6070-86744-0023 THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANSWERED
6070-86744-0024 MY DEAR FRANTZ REPLIED ALBERT WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO DELIVER HIM
6070-86744-0025 WHAT IS HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT IS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY IS HE A NATIVE
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESS HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HAND OF SENOR VAMPA WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASE AND UNCONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS AND DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ALBERT'S SIDE
6070-86744-0028 WELL SAID CHARLES WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT FOR YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND MY POWERS OF REFUTATION
6070-86744-0029 AND NOW MY DEAR FRANCE LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
6070-86745-0000 THEN SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS THE PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM GARDEN AND COURT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0002 AT A QUARTER TO TEN A VALET ENTERED HE COMPOSED WITH A LITTLE GROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASSEURS ALSO
6070-86745-0003 WAIT THEN DURING THAT DAY TELL ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISHED
6070-86745-0004 VERY WELL AT HALF PAST SEVEN
6070-86745-0005 IS THE PRINCESS UP YET
6070-86745-0006 THAT VALET LEFT THE ROOM
6070-86745-0007 GOOD MORNING LUCIEN GOOD MORNING SAID ALBERT YOUR PUNCTUALITY ALARMS ME
6070-86745-0008 YOU WHOM I EXPECTED LAST YOU ARRIVED AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIXED WAS HALF PAST
6070-86745-0009 NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW NOT CONFOUND OUR PLANS
6070-86745-0010 YES HE HAS MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGES IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTH
6070-86745-0011 IT IS FOR THAT REASON YO SEE ME SO EARLY
6070-86745-0012 I RETURN HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO HAVE A RIDE FOR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 PESTS I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT YOU WILL FIND THEM EXECRABLE
6070-86745-0014 BESIDES THAT DOES NOT CONCERN THE HOUSE BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
6070-86745-0015 BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PAPERS
6070-86745-0016 THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAY THAT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE
6070-86745-0018 COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIER
6070-86745-0019 WITH YOUR TALENTS YE WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM THE TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE AROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
6128-63240-0001 THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND TO ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
6128-63240-0002 SHE IS WILLING TO RISK IT
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH A WORKADAY ASPECT
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL REDSTONE
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF HIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON THE BRONZE MEDAL
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOLDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELDS
6128-63240-0009 THEN HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPAS AND ROARING RADICALS
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH
6128-63240-0012 HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LONNER WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6128-63240-0013 SHE IS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LATTER
6128-63240-0014 HAVE BEEN IN EUROPE
6128-63240-0015 NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANY WHERE
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES IT SHE WOULD LIKED TO ABOLISH IT
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DIRECTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LENA
6128-63240-0018 YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE
6128-63240-0019 MISSUS LENA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0020 ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE HAD COME BACK FOR
6128-63240-0021 BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BUSTON AND DON'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0022 THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORM
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANDOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LONEY'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT ON HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A THEATRE PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINED SO EARLY
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LUNEY'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANLOW THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BAEOTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUU'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002 RANDOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER AND HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN AND ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0009 OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF SOMETHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAVED AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0012 HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BEZER RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF HAVE THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE LADIES IN BEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT THE BALLOT
6128-63244-0002 PERHAPS HE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER INTENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
6128-63244-0004 OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WAS A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0005 ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FAMENDER WHO LIVED AT RUXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINGERS SUPPOSED SO THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0007 SHE WISHED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCES OF THE PEOPLE
6128-63244-0008 THIS MAY SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0009 CHARLEY WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WIDE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH THE MOST
6128-63244-0010 OLIVE WONDERED HOW MISSUS BARRINGER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
6128-63244-0011 IF IT IS NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING
6128-63244-0012 OUR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEARS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
6128-63244-0013 RAISE THE STANDARD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME YOUR NAMES
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CURRANTS MISSUS FARRINGER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0015 SAID OLIVE WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSION OF RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0016 I WON'T TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF HER SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
6128-63244-0018 THE UNHAPPINESS OF PEOPLE
6128-63244-0019 THEY WERE HER SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THE DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WITH THE GREAT THE JUST REVOLUTION IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTAL BLOOD STAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0021 THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF PEOPLE WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE MIST OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY A SUCCESS
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BIRD'S EYES APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEM ALREADY A MARTYR
6128-63244-0024 OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG AND UNREWARDED WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OR AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY A PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
6432-63722-0000 BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YOU FIGURE ON DOIN SOME DETECTIN AN GIVING UP FISHIN
6432-63722-0001 AND SHAGG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
6432-63722-0002 I'M GOING OFF FISHIN I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING AND MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
6432-63722-0003 GET READY SHAG YASSE COLONEL
6432-63722-0004 AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN THE CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
6432-63722-0005 PINKUS AND DONOVAN HAVEN'T THEY CARROLL YOU UP
6432-63722-0006 CAROL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARDS FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
6432-63722-0007 ARE YOU GOING TO WORK IN THAT CASE COLONEL
6432-63722-0008 BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT THAN THAT CAT
6432-63722-0009 PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED COLONEL ASHLEIGH
6432-63722-0010 WE'VE GOT OUR MEN AN THAT'S ALL WE WANT
6432-63722-0011 YOU'RE IN THE DARCY CASE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YES
6432-63722-0012 I'M WORKING IN THE INTEREST OF THE YOUNG MEN
6432-63722-0013 IT'S JEST ONE O THEM COINCIDENCES LIKE
6432-63722-0014 BUSTED HIS HEAD IN WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE OF THE PAIR
6432-63722-0015 GAD REPLIED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0016 THE VERY CHAIR I WAS GOING TO BUY
6432-63722-0017 LOOK HERE COLONEL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
6432-63722-0018 AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT SO MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN A WINDOW OF SINGA PHUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63722-0020 I'M AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
6432-63722-0021 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED SHER ALI
6432-63722-0022 ANYHOW HE AND PUD DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL IT SEEMS
6432-63722-0023 NEIGHBORS OFTEN HEARD HIM SCRAPING A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
6432-63722-0024 TOWARD DUSK A MAN WENT IN TO BUY A LAMP
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND A HEAVY CANDLESTICK NEAR IT
6432-63722-0026 SHORT HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
6432-63722-0027 MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOES TALKED IN THE FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0028 AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT YES IT'S THERE
6432-63722-0029 THAT'S THE WATCH ANNOUNCED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE REACHING IN FOR IT GOING IT SEE
6432-63722-0030 YOU'RE NOT AS SQUEAMISH AS ALL THAT ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DEAD MAN'S HAND AND A WOMAN'S
6432-63722-0031 AND DONALAN'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SCEPTICAL
6432-63722-0032 YES IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUGH EDGES IN IT
6432-63722-0033 AN I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
6432-63722-0034 IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE IT A BIT
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH THE NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF A STILL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF THE LEAD PENCIL
6432-63722-0038 AND DONOVAN TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THE WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
6432-63722-0039 ASKED THE SURPRISE DETECTIVE YES
6432-63722-0040 DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF UPON IT WHATEVER YOU DO WHY NOT
6432-63722-0041 SIMPLY BECAUSE HIS WATCH
6432-63722-0042 SOMEBODY OUT HERE TO SEE YOU
6432-63722-0043 ALL RIGHT BE THERE IN THE SECOND
6432-63722-0044 SINGER PHUT WAS THE PANTING ANSWER
6432-63722-0045 I WANT TO TALK OVER DARCY'S CASE WITH YOU THE COLONEL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD THOUGHT HAD TALKED AGAIN AND WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
6432-63722-0046 WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO ON IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0047 RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTH PROPOSITION
6432-63722-0048 AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING BUT HE DON'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0049 AND YOU DON'T WANT IT EITHER
6432-63722-0050 BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW
6432-63722-0051 BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK
6432-63722-0052 IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I'LL PRETEND I'M FISHING I MAY CATCH SOMETHING
6432-63722-0053 IN FACT I HAVE A FEELING I'LL LAND MY FISH
6432-63722-0054 I'D RECOMMEND HIM TO YOU INSTEAD OF BLACK STONE THANKS LAPPED KENNETH
6432-63722-0055 WHAT IS IT I CAN HELP YOU
6432-63722-0056 THE OLD ADAGE OF TWO THINGS YOU KNOW
6432-63722-0057 YET IT STILL HOLDS GOOD
6432-63722-0058 NO ALIMONY RETURNED THE COLONEL PUZZLED YES JUST THAT
6432-63722-0059 AND THERE IS NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW
6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLACED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
6432-63723-0001 WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
6432-63723-0002 THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY ANSWERED KENNETH
6432-63723-0003 I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT
6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER DON'T THINK I AM NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
6432-63723-0005 I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
6432-63723-0006 IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTELKEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
6432-63723-0007 WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASK THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0009 THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
6432-63723-0010 AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT IS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED
6432-63723-0011 SHE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012 SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0013 THIS LARCH MADE NO DEFENCE
6432-63723-0014 LATCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELING WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNCIL FEE
6432-63723-0016 NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT O HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0017 AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE UP
6432-63723-0018 I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN A YOUNG JEWELLER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0020 IT HAVE A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTION ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALL ROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
6432-63723-0022 LARCH HIMSELF IS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
6432-63723-0023 IN A SMALL PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
6432-63723-0024 AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH HE WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RACHFORD HAD MARRIED
6432-63723-0025 TO THIS IS THE ANSWER WHISPERED MONEY
6432-63723-0026 AND IN A WAY IT IS TRUE
6432-63723-0027 SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGE
6432-63723-0028 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
6432-63723-0029 THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCHE THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
6432-63723-0030 BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED AND WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
6432-63723-0031 IT WON'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL

6432-63723-0033 DON'T WORRY IT'LL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0034 I AM GOING TO RECTIFY THEM AND IT WILL TAKE TIME
6432-63723-0035 IT'S HARD FOR MISS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE IS BEARING UP LIKE A MAJOR
6432-63723-0036 SO KING GOT BAIL AND PUT IT UP

6432-63723-0050 I SAID I WAS GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY WITH AN EFFORT
6432-63723-0051 WHY POLONIUS SOMEBODY ASKED
6432-63723-0052 BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
6432-63723-0053 THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKETS
6432-63723-0054 IT'S IT'S AN OLD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
6432-63723-0055 I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED THEM WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
6432-63723-0056 THAT IS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELER
6432-63723-0057 NOW HARRY KING HAD IT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY
6938-70848-0000 THEN THE SUN CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY AT NOON
6938-70848-0001 THE COLDS AND RHEUMATISMS OF THE RAINY MONTHS VANISHED
6938-70848-0002 ASKED A WORKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE JANKERS
6938-70848-0003 WHY DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US ONE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARM IN A SLING
6938-70848-0004 HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM BY THE DEVIL
6938-70848-0005 WHO ARE YOU TO DESTROY THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS LENIN A GENTLEMAN
6938-70848-0006 WHO ARE YOU A COUNTERVOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THE BELOVED ADAM
6938-70848-0007 YOU CALL YOURSELF THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU ARE NOT THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA
6938-70848-0008 THE PEASANTS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT TILL THE PEASANTS
6938-70848-0009 WE KNOW WHAT THE PEASANTS WILL SAY AREN'T THEY WORKINGMEN LIKE OURSELVES
6938-70848-0010 THIS MAN ESPECIALLY WELCOMED A CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PEASANTS
6938-70848-0011 THIS LAST WAS THE YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
6938-70848-0012 WHEREUPON THE OLD EXECUTING COMMITTEE LEFT THE HALL
6938-70848-0013 DOWN WITH THEM THEY SHRIEKED
6938-70848-0014 FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN THE BOLSHEVIKI
6938-70848-0015 ON MY RETURN I VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANY ONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
6938-70848-0016 MEANTIME THE QUESTION OF THE STRATUS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
6938-70848-0017 BY DECLINING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO BLOCK THE REELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LATTER SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRILIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
6938-70848-0020 THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WOULD NOT DARE TO BREAK WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
6938-70848-0021 FOLLOWED HIM OLENIN LISTENED TO HIM WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
6938-70848-0022 THE FIRST AID WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALIST AND THE LANDOWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CLOSELY RELATED
6938-70848-0023 THE DUMES AND ZAMSTOOLS WERE DROPPED
6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW IT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED
6938-70848-0025 HE SPOKE TO THE RAM CONVENTION
6938-70848-0026 THE VILLAGES WOULD SAVE US IN THE END
6938-70848-0027 THE PRESENT MOMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IT IS INVINCIBLE
6938-70848-0028 THE WILL OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN A HALL
6938-70848-0029 NEW HUMANITY WILL BE BORN OF THIS WAR
6938-70848-0030 I GREET YOU WITH THE CHRISTENING OF THE NEW RUSSIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM
7018-75788-0000 THEN I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
7018-75788-0001 A SHIP WAS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THE DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
7018-75788-0002 HEARING THIS I WAS SORE TROUBLED REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED FROM THE APE
7018-75788-0003 UPON THIS HE BROUGHT ME A COTTON BAG AND GIVING IT ME SAID TAKE THIS BAG AND FILL IT WITH PEBBLES FROM THE BEACH AND GO FORTH WITH A COMPANY OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO WHOM I WILL GIVE A CHARGE RESPECTING THEE
7018-75788-0004 DO AS THEY DO AND BELIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FARTHER THY RETURN VOYAGE TO THY NATIVE LAND
7018-75788-0005 THEN HE CARRIED ME TO THE BEACH WHERE I FILLED MY BAG WITH PEBBLES LARGE AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLKS ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH BEARING A BAG LIKE MINE FILLED WITH PEBBLES
7018-75788-0006 TO THESE HE COMMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO THEIR CARE AND SAID THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY GET HIS DAILY BREAD AND YOU WILL EARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
7018-75788-0007 NOW SLEEPING UNDER THESE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES WHEREUPON MY COMPANIONS BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING OF THE FRUITS OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE FOLK
7018-75788-0008 WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF A DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
7018-75788-0009 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY NINTH NIGHT
7018-75788-0010 AND CEASED NOT SAILING TILL WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT BASSORAH
7018-75788-0011 THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGHDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTER AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FORGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STOREHOUSES
7018-75788-0012 AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THAT GREAT PROFIT AND GAIN I HAD MADE
7018-75788-0013 NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING MOHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL CREATURES BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND WISHED HIM GOOD DAY
7018-75788-0014 HERE I FOUND A GREAT SHIP READY FOR SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD WITH THEM GOODS OF PRICE SO I EMBARKED MY BALES THERE
7018-75788-0015 HAPPILY AMONG YOU IS ONE RIGHTEOUS WHOSE PRAYERS THE LORD WILL ACCEPT
7018-75788-0016 PRESENTLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE MOUNTAIN AND BROKE UP AND ALL AND EVERY THING ON BOARD OF HER WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75788-0017 BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS COLOUR AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE TRAVELERS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
7018-75788-0018 EACH THAT DIED WE WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTHES AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE UNTIL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT A LITTLE PROVISION LEFT I WHO WAS WONT TO HAVE SO MUCH
7018-75788-0019 BUT THERE IS MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT
7018-75789-0000 IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST NIGHT
7018-75789-0001 THEN SAYING FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND CORMORINE ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIP'S STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD MAKING ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
7018-75789-0002 LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE ON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS OF NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
7018-75789-0003 I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED THE RAFTS WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAMS CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT IN MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0005 WHEN I WOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
7018-75789-0006 AND I WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE RIVER
7018-75789-0007 WHEN THEY SAW I UNDERSTAND THEM NOT AND MADE THEM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER
7018-75789-0008 O MY BROTHER ANSWERED HE WE ARE HUSBANDMEN AND TILLERS OF THE SOIL WHO CAME OUT TO WATER OUR FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS AND FINDING THEE ASLEEP ON THIS RAFT LAID HOLD OF IT AND MADE IT FAST BY US AGAINST THOU SHOULDEST AWAKE AT THY LEISURE
7018-75789-0009 I ANSWERED FOR ALLAH'S SAKE OH MY LORD ERE I SPEAK GIVE ME SOMEWHAT TO EAT FOR I AM STARVING AND AFTER ASK ME WHAT THOU WILT
7018-75789-0010 IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SECOND NIGHT
7018-75789-0011 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HAVE TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING THAT HE MAY ACQUAINT HIM WITH HIS ADVENTURES
7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH A CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0013 SO I AROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND
7018-75789-0014 QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US ON OUR HEAD AND EYE BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST US WITH THY COMPANY
7018-75789-0015 BY ALLAH OH MY LORD ANSWERED I THOU HAST INDEED OVERWHELMED ME WITH THY FAVOURS AND WELL DOINGS BUT I WEARY FOR A SIGHT OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND NATIVE COUNTRY
7018-75789-0016 THEN I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND OF ALL MY INTIMATES AND ACQUAINTANCES IN THE ISLAND AND EMBARKED WITH THE MERCHANT AFORESAID
7018-75789-0017 HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH OH COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER
7018-75789-0018 FOR STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND ON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUESTS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
7018-75789-0019 HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THIS AND AS FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST WITNESSED
7018-75789-0020 PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRY MAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED
7018-75789-0021 SUCH THEN O MY BROTHER IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL ME IN MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TO MORROW INSHALLAH
7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIXTH
7018-75789-0023 IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD THE SEAMAN
7018-75789-0026 KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE IN ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH IN MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGDAD CITY TO BUSSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN ROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLIMBED TO THE MASTHEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IT IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT YOU WHOSO COME HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS A SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE IN WHICH WE HAD SEEN NAUGHT MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERY THING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO PLATTER BATH'S GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HOUSE IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THAT QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH A EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BY ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DETECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DOWNING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THE VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATHLIKE HUSH
7105-2330-0007 THE FOREMAN DELIVERED HIS MESSAGES
7105-2330-0008 THE JURY FOUND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISH TO ADD A WRITER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A BI ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS ON HAND
7105-2330-0010 AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE POLE A JUNIOR COUNSEL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
7105-2330-0011 SIXTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF
7105-2330-0012 OUR MAJORITY LAST TIME WAS ONLY A THOUSAND IN SEVEN
7105-2330-0013 ELEVEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTER BATH IS OUT BEFORE THE POLE OPENS
7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RED RAPPAS INN TO NIGHT
7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRILONG REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
7105-2330-0017 HE EXCLAIMED I WON'T GO
7105-2330-0018 HE SAYS HE NEVER HAD LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM OUT AND HE'S NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW
7105-2330-0019 SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A RELEASE PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ESTIMATES
7105-2330-0020 ANY WAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BAND
7105-2330-0021 PAUL OPEN IN FIVE MINUTES
7105-2330-0022 IS BLADDER BUFF OUT YET
7105-2330-0023 IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHAT
7105-2330-0024 THE CHIEF ORGANIZER RAN OFF
7105-2330-0025 THIS IS NOT THE MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
7105-2330-0026 CAN'T YOU GET A STRIKE PERMIT ASKED THE ORGANISER
7105-2330-0027 I WILL TRY SAID THE HOME SECRETARY AND WENT TO THE TELEPHONE
7105-2330-0028 EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WE'LL VOTE THE WAY
7105-2330-0029 A TELEGRAM WAS BROUGHT
7105-2330-0030 IT WAS FROM THE CENTRAL COMERY ROOMS AT NEMESIS
7105-2330-0031 WITHOUT A BAND HE COULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND
7105-2330-0032 A QUARTER PAST HALF PAST
7105-2330-0033 HAVE YOU ANY HAND INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY NATURE TO PLAY
7105-2330-0034 DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANIZER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS THOSE SORTS OF THINGS
7105-2330-0035 THE WARDERS HAVE A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THAT MEN THEMSELVES
7105-2330-0036 LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID A CHIEF ORGANIZER
7105-2330-0037 THE POPULAR SONG OF THAT MOMENT REPLIED THE AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT TO THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF I DON'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONERS STRODE FORTH TO FREEDOM
7105-2330-0039 THE WORDS OF THE SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0040 A SEAT WAS LOST AFTER ALL BY A NARROW MATURITY
7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENSE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTERBATH FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
7105-2340-0000 WITH THAT NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIS HE WAS THE SORT OF PERSON ONE WANTED IN ONE'S HOUSE
7105-2340-0001 WELL THE FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID THE HUSBAND OR A DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE ESTATE
7105-2340-0002 BESIDES CYNICISM APART HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT THIS FAILING
7105-2340-0003 WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY HEALTHY NOT MERELY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVE NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THE THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY
7105-2340-0004 WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRED PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTEREFFECT OF A POLO ACCIDENT
7105-2340-0005 A WILFRED VINCOT HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONORS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRED HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK
7105-2340-0006 AND HER REPUTATION WAS AN UNPLEASANT ONE
7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOL DAYS ONWARD HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF CLEPTIMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION
7105-2340-0008 THE SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEONCOD TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THEIR CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRED SAYING HE IS PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS
7105-2340-0009 SIGNED WILFRED PIGEON
7105-2340-0010 I SUPPOSE HE IS BRINGING US A PRESENT FOR THEIR SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS
7105-2340-0011 THEIR TALK FLITTED NERVOUSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER
7105-2340-0012 IN THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER THE DINNER THEIR NERVOUSNESS AND AWKWARDNESS INCREASED
7105-2340-0013 OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETERS SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUESTS HERE THEY ALL ARE
7105-2340-0014 SUCH NICE USEFUL GIFTS A FEW DEPLICATES OF COURSE
7105-2340-0015 SEVEN CREAM JUGS PUT IN
7105-2340-0016 WE FEEL THAT WE MUST LIVE UPON CREAM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
7105-2340-0017 OF COURSE SOME OF THEM CANNOT BE CHANGED
7105-2340-0018 I PUT IT DOWN BY A CLARET JUG SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER OBJECT
7105-2340-0019 VIGILANCE WAS NOW COMPLETELY CROWNED WITH A SENSE OF VICTORY
7105-2340-0020 AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR VISITOR MISSUS PETER EXPRESSED HER CONVICTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN NOTHING
7105-2340-0021 HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I AM HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY ONE OFF
7105-2340-0022 IT'S THE ONLY THING TO DO
7105-2340-0023 WILFRED WAS LATE IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS
7105-2340-0024 IT IS AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I AM AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU
7105-2340-0025 IT WAS A LITTLE PRESENT FROM MY MOTHER AND MYSELF FOR OUR SILVER WEDDING
7105-2340-0026 I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND YOU SEEM ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT RATHER AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING YOU ANOTHER
7105-2340-0027 THUS SNATCHER HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THESE MANY YEARS
7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNESTON PAGE ANDCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPAST OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
7105-2340-0029 HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED BLANKLY AND DELIBERATELY AT ONE ANOTHER
7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE WERE AT BREAKFAST
7105-2340-0031 SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVER WARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HAND
7105-2340-0032 THE PIGEON COATS HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETER HAD THE FINAL INSPIRATION
7105-2340-0033 PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
7105-2340-0034 MISSUS PETERS TURNED TO HER GUEST WITH CONFIDENTIAL COYNESS
7105-2340-0035 PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS A TRANSCENDED FAMILY GOOD LORD
7105-2340-0036 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE IS A CLEPTOMANIA LIKE COUSIN SNATCHER
7105-2340-0037 BRAVE LITTLE WOMEN SAID PETER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT
7902-96591-0000 IM FROM THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST
7902-96591-0001 DON'T CRY HE SAYS I WAS OBLIGED TO COME
7902-96591-0002 AND AND YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANY THING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
7902-96591-0003 I WISHED YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE
7902-96591-0004 THAT MY FATHER SIR BRISDON GRAHAM HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE
7902-96591-0005 HE CAN NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YOU SHALL NOT TELL
7902-96591-0006 PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHIE IS SILENT
7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHY STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RAINSTROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON HIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NOW HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MUST EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING AND THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED IN THE STONE SILL
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTLE PIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0018 YET IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0019 NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE CAN NOT DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST A WALL IN TWO PLACES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD FALL
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THAT THE HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MAY DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
7902-96592-0000 SURE YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES QUITE
7902-96592-0001 IM GOING HOME TO BREAKFAST
7902-96592-0002 SHALL I COME TO FATHER NO
7902-96592-0003 STOP HERE TILL SIR RISDON COMES DOWN AND TELL HIM I'M VERY SORRY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED OUT LAST NIGHT ONLY A BORN FOOL SAW JERRY ANDY'S LOBSTERBOAT COMING INTO THE COVE AND CAME RUNNING TO SAY IT WAS A PARTY FROM THE CUTTER YES FATHER
7902-96592-0004 TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERY THING CLEAR AWAY TO NIGHT
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHIE WYSTROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER DREAM HE THOUGHT HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEE THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHY DID ANDY CALL MISTER GURR
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS NAUGHTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0010 AND I AM HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE
7902-96592-0011 HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TO SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD REND AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARD THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONEWORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 WREM WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE
7902-96592-0016 HOLLO HE SAID WHO ARE YOU

7902-96592-0025 ARCHIE STEPPED BACK TO THE DOOR LISTENED BUT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND
7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY AROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE JOURNEY PRESENTED ITSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EARING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK IN ITS SHEATH
7902-96592-0032 NO I CAN'T PART WITH THAT HA HA CRIED THE BOY JEERINGLY
7902-96592-0033 I'LL YES I'LL GIVE YOU A GUINEA IF YOU WILL LET ME OUT

7975-280057-0002 MY MOTHER WHO WAS BESHEBA FRISTEAUX OF INDEPENDENCE WAS A DAUGHTER OF RICHARD FRISTEAUX WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON AT NEW ORLEANS JACKSON COUNTY HAVING BEEN SO NAMED AT MY GRANDFATHER FRISTEAUX'S INSISTENCE
7975-280057-0003 I CANNOT REMEMBER WHEN I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SHOOT
7975-280057-0004 MY BROTHER JAMES WAS BORN JANUARY FOURTEENTH EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT JOHN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE AND ROBERT IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE
7975-280057-0005 MY ELDEST BROTHER RICHARD DIED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY
7975-280057-0006 MY FATHER WAS IN THE EMPLOY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND HAD THE MAIL CONTRACT FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

7975-280057-0008 MISS WASHINGTON WELLS AND HER SON SAMUEL ON THE ROAD HOME FROM KANSAS CITY TO LEE'S SUMMIT RECOGNIZED THE BODY AS THAT OF MY FATHER
7975-280057-0009 MISSUS WELLS STAYED TO GUARD THE REMAINS WHILE HER SON CARRIED THE NEWS OF THE MURDER TO COLONEL PEABODY OF THE FEDERAL COMMAND WHO WAS THEN IN CAMP AT KANSAS CITY
7975-280057-0010 MISS MC CORKELE JUMPED FROM THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE AND ESCAPED
7975-280057-0011 AS THE RAIDERS LIFT ONE OF THEM SHOUTED
7975-280057-0012 NOW OLD LADY CALL ON YOUR PROTECTORS WHY DON'T YOU CALL ON COLONEL YOUNGER NOW
7975-280057-0013 EVERY KNOCK REPRESENTED A HUMAN LIFE
7975-280057-0014 BUT SHE FAILED TO FIND THE COMFORT HE SOUGHT FOR ANNOYANCES CONTINUED IN A MORE AGGRAVATED FORM
7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SAME PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF THE PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
7975-280057-0016 I ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISONVILLE SHE WENT TO WAVERLEY WHERE SHE WAS HOUNDED CONTINUED
7975-280057-0018 ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT TO LESSINGTON WEEKLY

7975-280063-0006 JACKMEN WITH A PARTY OF THIRTY SEASONED MEN CHARGED THE INDIANA GUNS AND CAPTURED THEM BUT MAJOR FOSTER LED A GALLANT CHARGE AGAINST THE INVADERS AND RECAPTURED THE PIECES
7975-280063-0007 WE ARE OUT OF AMMUNITION AND WERE HELPLESS HAD THE FIGHT BEEN PRESSED
7975-280063-0008 THEY DID MARK MY CLOTHES IN ONE OR TWO PLACES

7975-280063-0012 THE WOUNDED OF BOTH FORTUNES WERE GATHERED UP AND WERE PLACED IN HOUSES
7975-280076-0000 ALTHOUGH EVERY BOOK PURPORTING TO NARRATE THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS WAS TOLD OF THE LIBERTY ROBBERY AND IMPLIED THAT WE HAD A PART IN IT THE YOUNGERS WERE NOT SUSPECTED AT THAT TIME NOR FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNISED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPARDS RED MARKERS AND BUD PENCE WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUANTRELLES
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAID WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BLOODSHED JUDGE MC LANE THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FATALLY
7975-280076-0003 NO WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGERS BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE WAS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
7975-280076-0004 JUNE THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE OBCOCK BROTHERS BANK AT CROYDON IOWA WAS ROBBED OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BY SEVEN MEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
7975-280076-0005 IT WAS CHARGED THAT ARTHUR MAC COY OR A C MC COY AND MYSELF HAD BEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE GAD'S HILL AFFAIR IN THE TWO STAGE ROBBERIES

7975-280076-0007 YOU MAY USE THAT LETTER IN YOUR OWN WAY
7975-280076-0008 I WILL GIVE YOU HIS OUTLINE AND SKETCH OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND ACTIONS AT THE TIME OF CERTAIN ROBBERIES WITH WHICH I AM CHARGED
7975-280076-0009 AT THE TIME OF THE GALLETON BANK ROBBERING I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM PLEZ TAILOR AND RECTOR
7975-280076-0010 THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SHERIFF BARKLEY AND FIFTY OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
7975-280076-0011 I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS AT FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY
7975-280076-0012 I THEN WENT TO ARKANSAS AND RETURN TO SAINT CLAIR COUNTY ABOUT THE FIRST OF MAY
7975-280076-0013 I WENT TO KANSAS WHERE OUR CATTLE WERE IN WOODS COUNTY AT COLONEL RIDGE'S
7975-280076-0014 DURING THAT SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS BUT AS THERE WAS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED THAT SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE I WAS
7975-280076-0015 I WENT THROUGH INDEPENDENCE AND FROM THERE TO K WEBBS
7975-280076-0016 THERE I TOOK DINNER AND THEN WENT TO DOCTOR L W TLYMAN'S
7975-280076-0017 OUR BUSINESS THERE WAS TO SEE E P HE WAS NOT AT HOME BUT THE FAMILY WILL REMEMBER THAT WE WERE THERE
7975-280076-0018 WE CROSSED ON THE BRIDGE STAYED IN THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING WE RODE UP TO THE CITY
7975-280076-0019 I MET SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AMONG THEM WAS BOB HUDSPTH
7975-280076-0020 WE WERE NOT ON GOOD TERMS AT THE TIME NOR HAD WE BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS
7975-280076-0021 POOR JOHN HE HAS BEEN HUNTED DOWN AND SHOT LIKE A WILD BEAST AND NEVER WAS THE BOY MORE INNOCENT
7975-280076-0022 DOCTOR LEWIS WAS HIS PHYSICIAN
7975-280076-0023 THERE WERE FIFTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS THERE WHO WOULD TESTIFY IN ANY COURT THAT JOHN AND I WERE THERE
7975-280076-0024 HELVIN FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WERE ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND NEITHER OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE ABOVE FOR JOHN AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MISTER SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND WAS IN HIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MISTER AND MISS FICKLE AFTER THE SERVICE
7975-280076-0025 ABOUT THE LAST OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE I ARRIVED AT CARROLL PARISH LOUISIANA
7975-280076-0026 I STAYED HERE UNTIL THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
7975-280076-0027 I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THE TIME I WAS AT NEOSIO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAY
7975-280076-0028 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY AT ADA IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY
7975-280084-0000 I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED WE SHOULD NOT SHOOT ANYBODY
7975-280084-0001 WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOOD BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT TO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
7975-280084-0002 WHEN WE CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BACK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
7975-280084-0003 J S ALLAN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
7975-280084-0004 TAKE YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY'RE ROBBING THE BANK
7975-280084-0005 AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS THE SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS AT THE BRIDGE THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
7975-280084-0006 ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT ON THE BANK
7975-280084-0007 CHADWELL AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
7975-280084-0008 IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN OTHERS
7975-280084-0009 MEAN TIME THE STREET WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY HOT
7975-280084-0010 EVERY TIME I SAW ANYBODY WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7975-280084-0011 DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UP IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
7975-280084-0012 CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO ITS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILLER'S MARE
7975-280084-0013 WHAT KEPT YOU SO LONG I ASKED FITTS
7975-280084-0014 AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THE BANK I TAKE THE ACCOUNT OF THE NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0015 WHERE'S THE MONEY INSIDE THE SAFE BOB ASKED
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL FITZ CHASED HIM WITH A BULL
7975-280084-0017 THE FIRST ONE MISSED HIM THE SECOND WENT THROUGH HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
7975-280085-0000 THAT NIGHT IT STARTED TO RAIN AND WE WORE OUT OUR HORSE
7975-280085-0001 FRIDAY WE MOVED TOWARDS WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMPED BETWEEN ELYSIAN AND GERMAN LAKE
7975-280085-0002 BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARM HOUSE CLOSE TO MANCAO
7975-280085-0003 THE DAY A MAN NAMED DUNNING DISCOVERED US AND WE TOOK HIM PRISONER
7975-280085-0004 FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE AGREED NOT
7975-280085-0005 NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POST HASTE INTO MANCAO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
7975-280085-0006 THE WHISTLE OF THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
7975-280085-0007 HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH THE PILLAR ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
7975-280085-0008 BUT THEY SOON AFTER GOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM BROKE MY WALKING STICK WITH A SHOCK
7975-280085-0009 WE WERE IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG SOUGHT HORSES WHEN THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE ANIMALS AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
7975-280085-0010 SIX STEPS TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T O VALT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J C
7975-280085-0011 FORMING IN LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE ON THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ROBBERS WERE DISCOVERED
7975-280085-0012 MAKE FOR THE HORSE I SAID EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
7975-280085-0013 THERE'S NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHARGE HIM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN
7975-280085-0014 I GOT UP AS A SIGNAL FOR THE CHANGE AND WE FIRED ONE VOLLEY
7975-280085-0015 ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELLED ON BOB IN SPITE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS FLAG OF TRUCE
7975-280085-0016 SHERIFF GLISPSON OF WATTAWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
7975-280085-0017 INCLUDING THOSE RECEIVED AND ON THE WAY FROM NORTHFIELD I HAD ELEVEN WOUNDS
7975-280085-0018 AND SHERIFF GSPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTECTORATE THAT MINNESOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
8131-117016-0000 CAPTAIN MURDO
8131-117016-0001 BUT MARSPORT HAS FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO KILL IT OFF
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENTS HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MEN
8131-117016-0003 THE STONE WALLS GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DARELS AND FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORIES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS WHERE NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS FORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0007 CAPTAIN MURDOCK WAS AN UNCOMMON FACTOR AND NOW WAS ASKING FOR MORE MEN
8131-117016-0008 THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET THEM TO HIM
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH THE SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE RELIEF
8131-117016-0010 I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THE WAY WE WOULD ON EARTH
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERYBODY NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT
8131-117016-0012 THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKE DOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THE STONE WALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
8131-117016-0013 HE PICKED OUT FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FATHER WILL COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TO NIGHT PICK ANY ROUTE THAT'S OPEN O K AND LET'S GO
8131-117016-0015 BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCK'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH
8131-117016-0016 TWO YEARS GORDON DEMANDED
8131-117016-0017 FOR A MOMENT GORDON CURSED HIMSELF
8131-117016-0018 HE BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT SECURITY NOW
8131-117016-0019 NOBODY HAS TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHORIC BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREE AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE SISTER WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PRESSURE OF THE FINELY TURNED CLUB IN HIS HANDS
8131-117016-0024 GORDON'S EYES POPPED AT IT
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWED A SENTIMENT HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVING NOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER FOUR COPES HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
8131-117016-0027 HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEY
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPPSE STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0029 TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL THE WAGGON
8131-117016-0030 WE'RE NOT USING WAGONS MURDOCK TOLD THEM LINE THEM UP
8131-117016-0031 IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED HEAVILY
8131-117016-0032 MURDOCH INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS SICK AS GORDON'S
8131-117016-0034 I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD A MAN
8131-117016-0035 COLONEL THEY'LL KILL ME I DON'T KNOW
8131-117016-0036 MURDOCK TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND TURNED TO THE WRETCHED TUFT
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD TURN UP AGAIN I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL FIND YOU
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER THAT
8131-117016-0039 MURDOCK SENT ONE OF THE MEN TO PICK UP THE SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD
8131-117016-0040 IN THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN WHO HAD BEEN BEATEN BEFORE
8131-117016-0041 GET A STRETCHER AND TAKE HIM WHERE EVER HE BELONGS HE ORDERED
8131-117016-0042 BUT THE CAPTAIN STARED FINALLY SIGHING
8131-117016-0043 NO THE COPSE THEY'RE GIVEN ME WE'RE COVERED GORDON
8131-117016-0044 THE STONEWALL GANG IS BACKING WAIN
8131-117016-0045 BUT IT IS GOING TO BE TOUGH ON THEM
8131-117016-0046 BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE GOT A YELLOW TICKET FOR SECURITY
8131-117016-0047 MURDOCK BLINKED HE RUBBED HIS EYES SLOWLY
8131-117016-0048 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAIN WILL BE REE ELECTED
8131-117016-0049 NOBODY WANTS THEM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER
8131-117016-0050 EVER SEE A RUSSIAN ELECTION
8131-117016-0051 NO YOU'RE A FIRSTER HE CAN'T LOSE
8131-117016-0052 AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND HIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH A DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WHAT THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM A FAIR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0055 COST THEM MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE ISZY IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE SEES IT
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT THE EARTH IDEAS OF THE STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
8131-117016-0058 THE COOKS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCK WAS TRAINING A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
8131-117016-0059 IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL AND NOTHING WAS HERE
8131-117016-0060 THIS COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D SEEN ON THE EARTH
8131-117016-0061 THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAIN WAS RE ELECTED
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHORE BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORISED PRECINCT HOUSE
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANYNIE HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117017-0002 AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HARRY'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117017-0003 GORDON HIT THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MARS KEEPER LET OUT A SHRILL WHISTLE
8131-117017-0004 GUNS SUDDENLY SEEMED TO BE FLOURISHING EVERY WHERE
8131-117017-0005 YOU CAN'T DO IT FOR ME
8131-117017-0006 I AM REFORMED I'M GOING STRAIGHT
8131-117017-0007 YOU DAMNED COPSE CANT ONIA WAS BLUBBERING
8131-117017-0008 ONE LOOK WAS ENOUGH THE WORK PAPERS HAD THE TELL TALE OVER THICKENING OF THE SIGNATURE THAT HAD SHOWN UP ON OTHER PAPERS OBVIOUSLY FORGERIES
8131-117017-0009 SOME TURNED AWAY AS GORDON AND THE OTHER COPS WENT TO WORK BUT MOST OF THEM WEREN'T SQUEAMISH
8131-117017-0010 WHEN IT WAS OVER THE TWO PICKED UP THE WHIMPERING CAPTIVE
8131-117017-0011 JENKINS THE OTHER COPPE HAD BEEN HOLDING THE WALLET
8131-117017-0012 MUST HAVE BEEN MAKING A BIG CONTACT ON SOMETHING FIFTY FIFTY
8131-117017-0013 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN TWO THOUSAND CREDITS IN THE WALLET
8131-117017-0014 WHEN GORDON AND JENKINS CAME BACK MURDOCK TOSSED THE MONEY TO THEM SPILT IT
8131-117017-0015 WHATEVER COMES TO HAND GOVERNMENT
8131-117017-0016 LIKE THAT SOCIAL CALL GORDON ASKED HIM
8131-117017-0017 THE LITTLE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD HIS ANCIENT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD FACE TURNING SOBER

8131-117017-0027 THANKS LIZZIE THANKS YOURSELF
8131-117017-0028 THE KID POCKETED THE MONEY GRATEFULLY NODDING
8131-117017-0029 THE LITTLE GUY KNEW MARS AS FEW OTHERS DID FROM ALL SIDES
8131-117017-0030 AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COPPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN ISSY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USE THE INFORMATION WITH A BEAT SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT OF THE UPPER BRACKETS HE'D STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS
8131-117017-0031 THE CAPTAIN LOOKED COMPLETELY BEATEN AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM AND DROPPED ON THE BENCH
8131-117017-0032 GO ON ACCEPT IT
8131-117029-0000 THERE WAS A MAN COMING FROM THE EARTH ON A SECOND SHIP WHO WOULD SEE HIM
8131-117029-0001 THE LITTLE PUBLISHER WAS BACK AT THE CRUSADERS AGAIN
8131-117029-0002 ONLY GORDON AND SHEILA ARE LEFT
8131-117029-0003 CREDIT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THE BUSINESSES WERE OPEN
8131-117029-0004 GORDON CAME TO A ROW OF TEMPORARY BUBBLES INDIVIDUAL DWELLINGS BUILT LIKE THE DOME AND OPAQUE FOR PRIVACY
8131-117029-0005 HE HAD BEEN LUCKY
8131-117029-0006 SCHOLBERG'S VOLUNTEERS WERE OFFICIAL
8131-117029-0007 FRED'S PLACE WAS STILL OPEN THOUGH THE CROOKED TABLES HAD BEEN REMOVED GORDON DROPPED TO A STOOL SLIPPING OFF HIS HELMET
8131-117029-0008 HE REACHED AUTOMATICALLY FOR THE GLASS OF ETHER NEEDLE BEER

8188-269288-0032 WHAT CAN SHE BE DOING UP BY HERSELF
8188-269288-0033 LESLIE LEFT THE ROOM BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY GONE A DOZEN PACES DOWN THE CORRIDOR BEFORE SHE MET ANY RETURNING
8188-269288-0034 ANNIE'S EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT HER CHEEKS WERE NO LONGER PALE AND THERE WAS A BRILLIANT COLOUR ON THEM
8188-269288-0035 SHE DID NOT TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE OF LISLIE BUT GOING INTO THE ROOM SHUT THE DOOR

8188-269288-0048 SHE GOT ON TO BED AS SHE SPOKE AND WRAPPED THE CLOTHES TIGHTLY ROUND HER
8188-269288-0049 CAN'T YOU MANAGE A CANDLE JUST FOR ONCE
8188-269288-0050 CERTAINLY SEATED EASILY
8188-269288-0051 SHE TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND LIT A CANDLE WHICH SHE PUT BEHIND HER SCREEN AND PREPARED TO GET INTO BED
8188-269288-0052 ANNE'S MANNER WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS
8188-269288-0053 ANNIE DID NOT MEAN TO CONFINE IN ANY ONE THAT NIGHT AND THE KINDEST THING WAS TO LEAVE HER ALONE
8188-269288-0054 TIRED OUT LIZZLY HERSELF DROPPED ASLEEP
8188-269288-0055 ANNY IS THAT YOU SHE CALLED OUT
8188-269288-0056 THERE WAS NO REPLY BUT THE SOUNDS OF HURRYING STEPS CAME QUICKER AND QUICKER NOW AND THEN THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN
8188-269288-0057 OH THIS WILL KILL ME MY HEART WILL BREAK IT WILL KILL ME
8188-269290-0000 THE GUILD OF SAINT PHILIP
8188-269290-0001 IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER THAT EVENING LIZLIE RAN UP TO HER ROOM TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR HER VISIT TO EAST HALL

8188-269290-0007 I WANT TO BE ALONE TO GO

8188-269290-0009 YOU FRET ME WITHOUT ENDURANCE
8188-269290-0010 WRAPPING A PRETTY BLUE SHAWL ABOUT HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS SHE TURNED TO ANNIE
8188-269290-0011 LISLIE WAS JUST CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER WHEN ANNIE CALLED AFTER HER
8188-269290-0012 I TOOK IT OUT SAID LESLIE TOOK IT OUT

8188-269290-0016 JANE HARRIET'S VOICE WAS HEARD IN THE PASSAGE
8188-269290-0017 AS SHE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR SHE HEARD IT BEING TURNED INTO THE LOCK
8188-269290-0018 WHAT COULD THIS MEAN SHE SAID TO HERSELF

8188-269290-0032 SCARCELY LIKELY REPLIED LESLEY SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO COME TO THE MEETING
8188-269290-0033 BUT MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LILIE AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
8188-269290-0034 MISSUS LAUDERDALE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHER TUTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE DIFFERENT HALLS ON A RAISED PLATFORM
8188-269290-0035 THEN A ROAR CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE WAS ANY COLCHESTER
8188-269290-0036 THE PHYSICAL PART OF YOUR TRAINING AND ALSO THE MENTAL PART ARE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED IN THIS GREAT HOUSE OF LEARNING SHE CONTINUED BUT THE SPIRITUAL PART IT SEEMS TO ME OUGHT NOT TO BE STRENGTHENED
8188-269290-0037 HERE HERE AN ONCE AGAIN HERE
8188-269290-0038 SHE UTTERED HER STERN REMARK STANDING UP
8188-269290-0039 MARJORY AND EILEEN WERE CLOSE TO HER
8188-269290-0040 I WILL TALK WITH YOU BELLE ARCHSON PRESENTLY SHE SAID
8188-269290-0041 THE NAMES OF THE MEMBERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO ME BEFORE THIS DAY WEEK
8188-269290-0042 AM I MY FATHER'S KEEPER
8188-269290-0043 YOU ASK HE CONTINUED
8188-269290-0044 GOD ANSWERS TO EACH OF YOU YOU
8188-269290-0045 THE WORLD SAYS NO I AM NOT BUT GOD SAYS YOU ARE
8188-269290-0046 ALL MEN ARE OUR BROTHERS
8188-269290-0047 FOR ALL WHO SIN ALL SUFFER YOU ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RESPONSIBLE
8188-269290-0048 AFTER THE ADDRESS THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
8188-269290-0049 IT WAS PAST TEN O'CLOCK WHEN HE LEFT THE HALL
8188-269290-0050 JUST AS SHE WAS DOING SO MISTER FRERE CAME UP
8188-269290-0051 ANY COLCHESTER IS YOUR ROOMFELLOW IS SHE NOT SHE SAID
8188-269290-0052 I SEE BY YOUR FACE MISSUS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DISTRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING ARE YOU KEEPING ANY THING BACK
8188-269290-0053 I AM AFRAID I AM SAID LIZZIE DISTRESSED NOW IN HER TONE
8188-269290-0054 I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS LORDDALE EXCEPT A VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED HERSELF
8188-269290-0055 EXCUSES MAKING NO DIFFERENCE
8188-269290-0056 THE GIRL WHO BREAKS THE RULES HAVE TO BE PUNISHED
8188-269290-0057 I TELL HER
8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHILE THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MONTNERRIS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICIALS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE CAPITAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLE MAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0004 WHERE'S THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER IT
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW FULL TWO HUNDRED FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME BEFORE MYSELF
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION AWAKE THE SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UP A COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVE LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALL FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0007 HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOUR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE CORNWEALTH
8188-274364-0008 MY LORD I HAVE NOW TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG VANE FALLING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THE MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO PRYM WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MONEY
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSED FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT
8280-266249-0000 OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THAT PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO TAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURES THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOUR
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION ON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0004 THERE ARE SOME NICE PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0005 BESIDES OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RANALD LAUGHING
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ANSWERED THE LITTLE GROUP YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I SUPPOSE
8280-266249-0007 AND WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR HERD I SHOULD JUDGE
8280-266249-0008 DO YOU LOVE WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009 HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE BOY
8280-266249-0010 SUPPOSE YOU AND HE SHOOK HANDS FRANK
8280-266249-0011 I DO INDEED THOUGH PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF THEIR AILMENT
8280-266249-0012 DOUBTLESS THAT WAS THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMEN'S CABIN WHERE THERE'S A LIGHT
8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWED AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACTED TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF A DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND THE POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0017 IS IT STRANGE THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENTS
8280-266249-0018 THAT THE FRENCH POLYTECHNICA INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECT UPON THE MIND
8280-266249-0019 NOTICE A MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEWERS
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCUR WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0021 AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0022 A RESORT TO CIDER AND BEER
8280-266249-0023 NOW SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN
8280-266249-0024 FOR YOU ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GODS
8280-266249-0025 WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR BODY EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODY A LIVING SACRIFICE WHOLLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THIS INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALEY
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND NOUGHT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT THE TABLE AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0030 THEY ARE GAMBLING YONDER AND I AM AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0031 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN THIS DIRECTION
8280-266249-0032 NO SIR HE'S NOT HERE
8280-266249-0033 AND THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TO
8280-266249-0034 NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKY LIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0035 HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW AROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING TO HIS STATEROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0036 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN CRIED ONE
8280-266249-0037 A VENTRILOQUIST A BOARD OF COURSE RETURNED ANOTHER LET'S FOLLOW AND SEE THE FUN
8280-266249-0038 I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REPLIED THE FIRST LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT COME ON
8280-266249-0039 THAT FELLOW NICK WARD IS A NOTED BLACK AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE
8280-266249-0040 WHO ASKED THE MATE I HAVE SEEN NOTHING UP HERE THOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THE STEERAGE
8280-266249-0041 THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A COLD PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8280-266249-0042 THE MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0043 LET ME GO YELLED WARD MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIS ARM
8280-266249-0044 I DINKS NO I DINKS I DID YOU VON LESSEN RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
8280-266249-0045 THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTORS
8280-266249-0046 MISTER LIBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0047 YET THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARDE AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSION
8280-266249-0048 THEY KEEP IT UP TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT
8280-266249-0049 THEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN HIS STATEROOM NEARBY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0050 AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE THE STAKES WERE VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0051 THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREENBACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EARS TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND
8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS BY A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
8280-266249-0054 IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED WARD LOOK WHAT'S THERE LOOK AT YOURSELF
8280-266249-0055 WHAT CAN IT A BEEN THEY ASKED EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0056 AH NONSENSE WHAT FOOLS WE ARE
8280-266249-0057 IT WAS A LAST GAME OF CARDS FOR THAT TRIP
8280-266249-0058 THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THIS SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0059 TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DAILIES WERE IN VERY STRAITED CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0060 OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARE ON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE
8280-266249-0061 HOW WONDERFULLY HE HAS ANSWERED OUR PETITIONS
8280-266249-0062 LUCY ANSWERED PRESSING HER HAND AFFECTIONATELY ARE WE NOT SISTERS IN CHRIST
8280-266249-0063 WE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD BY FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
8280-266249-0064 WE ARE ALL ONE IN CHRIST JESUS
8280-266249-0065 WE FEEL MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE ARE ONLY THE STEWARDS OF HIS BOUNTY AND BECAUSE HE HAD SAID INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME IT IS THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE AND DELIGHT TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIS PEOPLE
8461-258277-0000 THEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTEENTH NIGHT
8461-258277-0001 BUT HE ANSWERED NEEDS MUST I HAVE ZANAB UL SAY NOW SUDDENLY THERE CAME A RAP AT THE DOOR AND THE MAID SAID WHO IS AT THE DOOR
8461-258277-0002 THE KNOCKER REPLIED KAMAH DAUGHTER OF AZARIAH THE JEW SAY ME IS ZALI OF CAIRO WITH YOU
8461-258277-0003 REPLIED THE BROKER'S DAUGHTER O THOU DAUGHTER OF THE DOG
8461-258277-0004 AND HAVING THUS ISLAMISED SHE ASKED HIM TWO MEN IN THE FAITH OF AL ISLAM GIVE MARRIAGE PORTIONS TO WOMEN OR DO WOMEN DO MEN
8461-258277-0005 AND SHE THREW DOWN THE JEW'S HAND BEFORE HIM
8461-258277-0006 NOW THE COURSE OF HER SLAYING HER SIRE WAS AS FOLLOWS
8461-258277-0007 THEN HE SET OFF REJOICING TO RETURN TO THE BARRACK OF THE FORTY
8461-258277-0008 SO HE ATE AND FELL DOWN SENSELESS FOR THE SWEET MEATS WERE DRUGGED WITH BANG WHEREUPON THE KAZI BUNDLED HIM INTO THE SACK AND MADE OFF WITH THEM CHARGER AND CHESS AND ALL TO THE BARROCO DE FORTE
8461-258277-0009 PRESENTLY HASAN SCHUMANN CAME OUT OF A CLOSET AND SAID TO HIM HAST THOU GOTTEN THE GEAR OH ALI
8461-258277-0010 SO HE TOLD HIM WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM AND ADDED IF I KNOW WHITHER THE RASCAL HAS GONE AND WHERE TO FIND THE KNAVE I WOULD PAY HIM OUT
8461-258277-0011 KNOW THOU WHITHER HE WENT
8461-258277-0012 ANSWERED HASAN I KNOW WHERE HE IS AND OPENING THE DOOR OF A CLOSET SHOWED HIM THE SWEETMEAT CELLAR WITHIN DRUGGED AND SENSELESS
8461-258277-0013 SO I WENT ROUND ABOUT THE HIGHWAYS OF THE CITY TILL I MET THE SWEETMEAT SELLER AND BUYING HIS CLOTHES AND STOCK IN TRADE AND GEAR FOR TEN DINARS DID WHAT WAS DONE
8461-258277-0014 QUOTH AL RASHID WHOSE HAND IS THIS
8461-258277-0015 SO ALI RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT HAD PASSED FROM FIRST TO LAST AND THE CALIPH SAID I HAD NOT THOUGHT THOU WOULDST KILL HIM FOR THAT HE WAS A SORCERER
8461-258277-0016 HE REPLIED I HAVE FOURTEEN LADS BUT THEY ARE IN CAIRO
8461-278226-0000 AND LAURA HAS HER OWN PET PLANS
8461-278226-0001 SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED A SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WEAR THE NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JUVAN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM AND HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-278226-0003 I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES AND MODERN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
8461-278226-0004 I REMEMBER ALL THE REUBEN SAYS AT THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
8461-278226-0005 SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH POOR GRAY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOLS AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AYESHA BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0006 HE WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0007 BUT SHE FIXED ON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN IN THE GALLERY
8461-278226-0008 PHILIP JOCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HIS WIFE MADE THIS DISCOVERY
8461-278226-0009 HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE OF PHILIP LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
8461-278226-0010 I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MOURNING ROOM AT JOCELYN STROCK
8461-278226-0011 SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ARTIST PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KIRSTO LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
8461-278226-0012 THEY HAVE SAID HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF OF THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
8461-278226-0013 BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL NOT HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARDS THE WORKS OF OTHERS
8461-278226-0014 I DON'T THINK WE WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HOUSE
8461-278226-0015 YOU'LL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOR PHILIP IF YOU'LL SAY YES
8461-281231-0000 HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGG THE WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS
8461-281231-0001 IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORLESTONE
8461-281231-0002 AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH FEAR OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
8461-281231-0003 WHAT ART THOU HE ASKED IN TERROR
8461-281231-0004 LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH ERICA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL

8461-281231-0007 THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID EURICA AND THE SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO WOULD EXTINGUISH THEM
8461-281231-0008 MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THE ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
8461-281231-0009 THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY THE BRACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
8461-281231-0010 THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCED HIS WAY INWARD IN SPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
8461-281231-0011 TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEIR LEADERS EFFORTS TO STOP THEM
8461-281231-0012 THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH A NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL WRUNG WITH FURIOUS BLOWS
8461-281231-0013 AT LENGTH DE BRACY
8461-281231-0014 TELL ME THY NAME AND WORK THY PLEASURE ON ME
8461-281231-0015 YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTANTS THEE TO KNOW
8461-281231-0016 EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER OR PERISH
8461-281231-0017 THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAMBER
8461-281231-0018 RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH THESE THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF OTHER PRISONERS
8461-281231-0019 BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANTS FRONT DE BOEUF
8461-281231-0020 AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE UUREKA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
8461-281231-0021 BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND AROSE THROUGH THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTERS
8461-281231-0022 AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED HER TORRENT
8461-281231-0023 WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORKESTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
8461-281231-0024 HE LEFT A GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF KOENIGSBERG AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ADDLESTANE WAS LAID
8461-281231-0025 DE BRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON THE HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOOD
8461-281231-0026 HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAD ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT AS A MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING
8461-281231-0027 SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS STRONG WAR HORSES AND RODE OFF THROUGH THE FOREST
8461-281231-0028 DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY BELOVED DAUGHTER REBECCA
8461-281231-0029 AND WITH THIS EPISTLE THAT UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
8461-281231-0030 THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTION FROM DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
8461-281231-0031 HE APPEALED TO THE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN HIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
8461-281231-0032 BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LYCAS BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY
8461-281231-0033 HE HAD NOT TILL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
8461-281231-0034 POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFICES UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK AROUND AND TO MIKE INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
8461-281231-0036 SHE GAZED ACCORDINGLY UPON THE SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
8461-281231-0037 AT HIS FEET WAS PLACED A TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THAT DAY
8461-281231-0038 PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THEIR SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
