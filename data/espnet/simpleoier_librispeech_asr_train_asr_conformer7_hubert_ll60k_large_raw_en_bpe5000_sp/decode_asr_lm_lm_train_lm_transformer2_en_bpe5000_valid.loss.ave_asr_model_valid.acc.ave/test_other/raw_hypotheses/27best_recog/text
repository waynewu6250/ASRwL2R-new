1688-142285-0000 THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL AN I
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHEWING HIS GUESTS DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOPBOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN WHAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNTS OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOT BOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HULSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT THEY HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHEWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PART OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 NOT HIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORK ROOM
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE WE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP THE FATHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO PERSON CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISTER THORNTON IS NOT WONT I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LEFT LITTLETON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED HAS HER FATHER
1688-142285-0016 OH PAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERYONE BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS THE NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND OF THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER KNEW THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS MEANS
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS THEN PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE RIGHT AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER HOWEVER OUT IT CAME
1688-142285-0024 OH PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0025 AN I DO SAID THE FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0026 PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL THIS
1688-142285-0027 I DON'T SET HIM OUT FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0028 BUT OH GOOD NIGHT CHILD
1688-142285-0029 THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS PAUL
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN HER BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON THEIR SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE ABOUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE STRANGE REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THEIR MISTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIME TO A SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS OF SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOOD TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL MISSY ARE YOU
1688-142285-0038 BETTER AND NOT BETTER IF YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
1688-142285-0039 NOT EXACTLY I REPLIED MARGARET SMILING
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER AND NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED OF MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND OF BOULAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FURTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED AROUND TO WALK A LONG SIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
1688-142285-0042 BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO WE DID NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0043 AT LAST SHE ADDED IN A LOW VOICE
1688-142285-0044 BESSY DO YOU WISH TO DO
1688-142285-0045 BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN HE REPLIED
1688-142285-0046 NOT WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS WE RECKON
1688-142285-0047 YET WHAT WAS IT
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I' AM A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON
1688-142285-0049 AND I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
1688-142285-0050 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YE NOW
1688-142285-0051 THE SHARPNESS IN HER FACE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALID STREET BESSY SIGHED
1688-142285-0053 YOU'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GROOVERISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0054 BUT NICHOLAS IS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
1688-142285-0055 GASPED BESSY AT ONCE
1688-142285-0056 BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER HANDS
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHEREVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT TO YOU AND GAVE IT WHAT IT IS
1688-142285-0059 NAY I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED TO
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU MAY BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0061 I WOULD BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
1688-142285-0062 THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVES YOUNG WOMAN
1688-142285-0063 I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY A BAD DEAL
1688-142285-0064 BUT WHO'S COME AT LAST AND WHO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HE'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING IN WHAT WHO KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT
1688-142285-0065 IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HARD TO KEEP
1688-142285-0066 BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLAYED AND THE MORE WITH MARGARET
1688-142285-0067 DON'T THINK HARSHLY ON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
1688-142285-0068 I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MAKED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF EITHER IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0069 THE FEVERISH COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEKS AND THE FEVERISH FLAME FROM HER EYE
1688-142285-0070 BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL HAVE MY HEART
1688-142285-0071 SHE PUT HER OWN HAND TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALE
1688-142285-0072 MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER PILLOW
1688-142285-0073 PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAY
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARY'S GOWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
1688-142285-0075 AND I'LL COME TO MORROW SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0076 MARGARET WAS AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
1688-142285-0077 SHE WAS LATE FOR TEA IN HOME
1688-142285-0078 HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERVANT DEARE
1688-142285-0079 NO MAMMA THAT ANNE BUCKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0080 S'POSE I TRY SAID MISTER HAY

1688-142285-0082 I MAY BE THE CINDERELLA TO PULL ON THE SLIPPER AFTER ALL
1688-142285-0083 WHAT WOULD HE DO PAPA HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT IT
1688-142285-0084 NOW I I WOULD APPLY IT TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS

1688-142285-0086 HER MOTHER OF WHOM HE SPOKE TO US SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0087 MISTER THORNTON THE ONLY LOVER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HALE QUIETLY
1688-142285-0088 BUT I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
1688-142285-0089 PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLEASURE
1688-142285-0090 SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THIS SAME FAMILY
1688-142285-0091 MY DEAR SAID MISTER HALE ALARMED PLEASE DON'T GO OFF ON THAT IDEA
1688-142285-0092 I AM SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT IT

2033-164915-0000 AND ALL TO THESE
2033-164915-0001 THEN SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HE GATHERED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN FELL DOWN A FAINTING FIT
2033-164915-0002 WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW THESE KINGS HE WONDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEWHAT TO COVER THEM WAITED TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
2033-164915-0003 AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND UZDAT AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LEFT HER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THESE VERSES
2033-164915-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANTS HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM BUT HOW HE HAD GOT FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BUYING HOW HE HAD MADE A MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD GONE ON TO HER AND HOW THE KING THEIR SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARRKAN
2033-164915-0005 BUT NOW GO TO THY MASTERS AND BRING HIM QUICKLY TO ME
2033-164915-0006 THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED THE CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO ACCORDINGLY SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE BOXER TILL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRDING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
2033-164915-0007 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE STALKER GIRDED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING O WOULD I KNEW WHAT IS BECOMES OF HIM

2033-164915-0011 TWAS AS I FEARED THE COMMON ILLS DISCERNED BUT UNTO ALLAH WE ARE ALL RETURNING
2033-164915-0012 THEN THE EUNUCH CRIED AMONG THE PAGES SAYING TAKE HIM OFF THE ASS

2033-164915-0016 SO IT WAS AGREED THAT WE GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARCHAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHER'S REALM

2033-164916-0002 WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE THINGS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAYNE TELL ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFELL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
2033-164916-0003 ZAUMA KHAN BOWED HIS HEAD A WHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THIS POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELLED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM ON THE RIGHT WAY
2033-164916-0004 THEN HE ADDED O MY UNCLE HOW SHALL I DO WITH MY BROTHER SHARWAN
2033-164916-0005 AFTER A WHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE POOL TIGHT SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY

2414-128292-0032 WILT THOU HAVE A REST IN THY HOME THIS EVENING
2414-159411-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAHMIN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE ON WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM
2414-159411-0001 THE BRAHMIN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THE CAGE YOU WILL EAT
2414-159411-0002 O FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN TRUTH THAT I WAS NOT
2414-159411-0003 I CAN NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND RETURN
2414-159411-0004 THEN THE BRAHMIN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD IT TURNED SO THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARDS
2414-159411-0005 SO THE BRAHMIN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A STANDANT TREE AND THE BRAHMIN SAID TO IT BANNANT TREE BANNON TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0006 ON WHAT MUST I LAY JUDGMENT ASKED THE BANDANT TREE
2414-159411-0007 THIS TIGER SAID THE BRAMIN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF THIS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE FOUND HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME
2414-159411-0008 THIS IS JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NO
2414-159411-0009 BUT LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MEN ARE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE
2414-159411-0010 SIR CAMEL SIR CAMEL CRIED THE BRAHMAN HEAR IT AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0011 AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY SAW A BULLOCK LYING BY THE ROADSIDE
2414-159411-0012 IS IT FAIRER THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NOT
2414-159411-0013 OH LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MEN HAVE NO PITY
2414-159411-0014 THREE OUT OF THE SIX AND GIVING JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMIN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINED TO PASS THE OTHER THREE
2414-159411-0015 ON WHAT MAY I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE EAGLE
2414-159411-0016 THE BRAHMIN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCKS AND STEALS AWAY MY LITTLE ONES
2414-159411-0017 THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID JUDGMENT OF ALLAH IS AGAINST YOU O BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0018 AFTER THIS THEY SAW THE ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMIN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVORABLE VERDICT
2414-159411-0019 BUT THE ALLIGATOR SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KEEP ME
2414-159411-0020 THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINION OF THE SITH JUDGE
2414-159411-0021 THERE THE SIXTH WAS A JACKAL
2414-159411-0022 THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACCO UNCLE JACKAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0023 SHOW HIM THE PLACE

2414-159411-0025 EXACTLY THERE WAS AN ASKED THE JACKAL

2414-159411-0027 WHERE WAS THE TIDER THEN
2414-159411-0028 WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE DIGGER JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON HIS SIDE
2414-159411-0029 VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL BUT I SHALL NOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY
2414-159411-0030 SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE BRAMBLE
2414-159411-0031 THEN I SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0032 WHEN THE BRAHMINS HAD DONE THIS THE JACKAL SAID O YOU WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL TIGER
2414-159411-0033 WHEN A GOOD BRAHMIN OPENED YOUR CAGE DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WOULD MAKE
2414-159411-0034 PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEY FRIEND BRADMAN
2414-159411-0035 YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY IN MIND HIS
2414-165385-0000 THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUETTE AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLATTERING PAM BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILISED MONKEY
2414-165385-0001 THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS INSTANCED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THE FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMIC WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU
2609-156975-0000 THEY MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN
2609-156975-0001 HOWDOORN HOPHAST HODOUBT PATE SINCE HIS GENIUS
2609-156975-0002 LET'S HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MATRON MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET IT'S THERE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT
2609-156975-0003 THE EGYPTIANS BACKGROUND OF THE BONDAGE
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHOSE TURBANT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KIERNAPATH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST PABLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIANS AND SCRIPZINS GIVE OF THAT PERIOD
2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PRINCIPALLY NATURAL
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ALTAMIS CORVETTES INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES PROSPERING TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDO WERE THE CHIEF FACTORS IN ITS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
2609-156975-0008 THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATIONS OF HIS SOJOURN IN EGYPT
2609-156975-0009 THE LATER TRADITIONS CONTINUED TO EXTEND THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY PATAM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATIM
2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY IN SCRIPT AND ULSER STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHAM THE HOUSE OF RAMESES A CITY WITH THE ROYAL RESIDENCE IN TEMPLES
2609-156975-0012 THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS CYRENNY WAS NATURALLY INEVITABLE
2609-156975-0013 WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM IT THE DESPOTIC ROAR OF THAT LAND THE DAY
2609-156975-0014 IS THE MAKING OF A LOYAL PATRIOT
2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES'S BIRTH AND EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
2609-156975-0016 WITH MOSES'S JUST FINDIN RESISTIN THE GYPSIN TACT MASTER
2609-156975-0017 IS PLANIONAGE ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
2609-156975-0018 NIT'REE HE WENT TO THE LAND OF MIDIAN
2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESSES TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTIANS AND FUGITIVES
2609-156975-0020 FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND B G
2609-156975-0021 ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUIN THE HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
2609-156975-0022 THESE LAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KIDDAM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN SOME TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0024 ON THE SCORE OF THE WEARINESS
2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUATE
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIEST OF THE SUBTRIBE OF THE KINITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER AND MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0027 NOTE THE CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF VARIOUS
2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS THE LEADER AND DELIVERERS OF HIS PEOPLE
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT UP WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER CENTRAL PALESTINE
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAWING THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KINITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAHWAY OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GUIDE WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0031 DO THE EARLIEST EBREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0032 THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIS THAT THIS PRIESTS MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0033 MOSES IN THE TIME OF THE MIDIAN PRIESTS WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0034 THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO A WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
2609-156975-0035 HIS QUEST WAS FOR A JUDTS AND STRONG GANE ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENS THIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON A POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST AND TONNIAN PLAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA MINOR SYRIL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVING SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
2609-156975-0038 THIS CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES'S CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP IN ACTION
2609-157645-0000 EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PLEASANT FOR THE ROYAL FOE AND TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
2609-157645-0001 THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGUISING QUOD AT THE SMOAKEN IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
2609-157645-0002 SOMETIMES TOBACCO IS USED IN CHURCH FOR DISINFECTANT OR DEORODORIZING PURPOSES
2609-157645-0003 BLACKBURN HART'S BICEP OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER
2609-157645-0004 ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH LININGHAM FOR A CONFORM MASON
2609-157645-0005 ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER SIDNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTERRY AT HATTON
2609-157645-0006 BAR WAS SUCH A CONTINUOUS SMOKER THAT ANY ONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HADN'T NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF A PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENCE
2609-157645-0007 ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITSFIELD HE HANDED MASTER PIPE AND JOSTLEER THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING EM
2609-157645-0008 THEM IN THEM SING ANOTHER PSALM SAID THE CURATE
2609-157645-0009 THEY HAVE HERE REPLIED THE CLERK
2609-157645-0010 THEN LET THEM SING THE TWO HUNDRED AND NINETEENTH REPLIED THE CURATE
2609-157645-0011 SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AND AS MANY TOBACCO PIPES IS TO THE MEN OF OFFICE
2609-157645-0012 DAVID DEANE SAVOR DENIED AT ALL PROVED THIS IRREVERANCE
2609-157645-0013 GOING TO CHURCH SAINT HAINE'S IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN A QUAINT IN A SIGNING EXPERIENCE
2609-157645-0014 WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
2609-169640-0000 PARROTS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY THE SCEPTS IT IS TRUE BUT THE SEAS FOUR OF THEM AND FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE
2609-169640-0001 AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JUST KEPT STEERAGE WAY ON THIS SHIP
2609-169640-0002 FORTUNATELY THE JOHN WAS NOT ONLY FAT BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS THE LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS ON UNLIVELY DANCE
2609-169640-0003 I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SIP POT'S HE SPECTS EE IN MODERATE WEATHER
2609-169640-0004 MISTER MARBLE HE I DO B'LIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HINCOOPS BEIN LIKE THE SAILORS AS ONE MIGHT SAY BERRY ASLEEP
2609-169640-0005 AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE WHEN FAMILIAR TO SEA MEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN THE BOAT
2609-169640-0006 I SING OUT SAIL HO AND CLOSE ON BOARD
2609-169640-0007 HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THAT WAS TO BE DONE
2609-169640-0008 ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET TO OUR ONE THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
2609-169640-0009 AS OUR SEATS WERE OFF FLYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME A LEASURE TO LOOK ABOUT
2609-169640-0010 I SOON SAW BOTH PRANTZ AND QUIET ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER
2609-169640-0011 MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS ALSO AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCALS ABACKS
2609-169640-0012 A PURPOSE STILLNESS SUCCEEDED
2609-169640-0013 THE PROUTS DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED US FAST
2609-169640-0014 I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING IRONS TOO AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
2609-169640-0015 KARI WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
2609-169640-0016 THE STILLNESS THAT REIGNED ON BOTH SIDES WAS LIKE THAT OF DEATHS
2609-169640-0017 THE GIANT BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME DOWN LIKE A TAR
2609-169640-0018 THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER WE COULD PASS EM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
2609-169640-0019 THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INCIDENT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE AND THE CLOSEST SENSATION TO HIS ORDERS
2609-169640-0020 NOT A SOUL ON BOARD THE JOHNNY WAS HURT
2609-169640-0021 ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMEN THE FOUR SIXES TWO AT THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERNMOST'S PROA WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
2609-169640-0022 THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN ANGUISH THAT
2609-169640-0023 I DOUBT IF WE'D CATCH A MAN IN THE NEAREST BOROUGH
2609-169640-0024 IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD OF HER CANVASS BINNED FORE LEAVING THE PROWER MOSCENLESS IN HER WAKE
3005-163389-0000 THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHIRBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK ON THE NOISE
3005-163389-0001 SOME SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE CHEER DOWN THE FENCE
3005-163389-0002 THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY AND FRIGHTFUL
3005-163389-0003 SHRWIN RUN HIS EYES SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUTGAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
3005-163389-0004 THE AVERAGE MAN'S A CHARACTER
3005-163389-0005 BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THEIR MAN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARK AND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
3005-163389-0006 SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUITT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH A HUNDRED MASKED COWARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
3005-163389-0007 YOU I DIDN'T WANT TO COME
3005-163389-0008 BUT A MOB WITHOUT ANY MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT IS BENEATH PITIFULNESS
3005-163389-0009 NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN UP ACROSS HIS LEFT HAND AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS THIS
3005-163389-0010 THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AND THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AND BUCK HARKNESS HE HEELED IT AFTER THEM LOOKING TOLERABLE CHEAP
3005-163389-0011 YOU CAN'T BE TOO CARELESS
3005-163389-0012 THEY ARGUED AND TRIED TO KEEP HIM OUT BUT HE WOULD N'T LISTEN AND THE WHOLE SHOW COME TO A STANDSTILL
3005-163389-0013 AND ONE OR TWO OTHER WOMEN BEGAN TO SCREAM
3005-163389-0014 SO THEN THE RING MASTER HE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCES AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSE
3005-163389-0015 IT WARN'T FUNNY TO ME THOUGH I WERE ALL OF A TREMBLE TO SEE HIS DANGER
3005-163389-0016 AND A HORSE A GOIN LIKE A HOUSE A FIRE TOO

3005-163391-0018 BLAMED IF HE DIDN'T ENQUIRE ABOUT EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN THAT BLESSED TOWN AND ALL ABOUT THE WILKESES AND ABOUT PETER'S BUSINESS WHICH WAS A TANNER AND ABOUT GEORGE'S WHICH WAS A CARPENTER AND ABOUT HARVEY'S WHICH WAS A DISSENTERY MINISTER AND SO ON AND SO ON THEN HE SAYS

3005-163391-0022 NOW HUSTLE BACK RIGHT OFF AND FETCH THE WOOD UP HERE AND THE NEW CARPET BAGS
3005-163391-0023 SO THEN THEY WAITED ON A STEAMBOAT

3005-163391-0026 THEN ONE OF THEM SAYS KIND OF SOFT AND GENTLY
3005-163399-0000 PHELPS'S WAS ONE OF THE LITTLE ONE HORSE COTTON PLANTATIONS AN THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE
3005-163399-0001 I WENT HOME AND CLIMBED OVER THE BACK STILE BY THE ASHHOPPER AND STARTED FOR THE KITCHEN
3005-163399-0002 AYE OUT WI THE YAS'UM FORE I THOUGHT
3005-163399-0003 SO THEN SHE STARTED FOR THE HOUSE LEADING ME BY THE HAND AND THE CHILDREN TAGGING BEHIND
3005-163399-0004 WHEN WE GOT THERE SHE SET ME DOWN IN A SPLIT BOTTOMED CHAIR AND SET HERSELF DOWN UPON A LITTLE LOW STOOL IN FRONT OF ME HOLDING BOTH OF MY HANDS AND SAYS

3005-163399-0012 I HAD MY MIND ON THE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME AND WANTED TO GET THEM OUT TO ONE SIDE AND PUMP THEM A LITTLE AND FIND OUT WHO I WAS
3005-163399-0013 PURTY SOON SHE MADE THE COLD CHILL STREAK ALL DOWN MY BACK BECAUSE SHE SAID
3005-163399-0014 I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEAD I'D GONE TO THROW UP MY HAND
3005-163399-0015 SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I'D GOT TO REST THE TRUTH
3005-163399-0016 I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME DOWN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE HE COMES
3005-163399-0017 CHILDREN AND DON'T YOU SAY A WORD
3005-163399-0018 I SEE WE WAS IN A FIX NOW
3005-163399-0019 MISSUS PHELPS SHE JUMPS IN HIM AND SAYS
3005-163399-0020 HAS HE COME NO SAYS A HUSBAND
3005-163399-0021 I CAN'T IMAGINE ASKED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MAKES ME DREADFUL UNEASY
3005-163399-0022 UNEASY SHE SAYS I'M READY TO GO DISTRACTION
3005-163399-0023 HE MUST A COME AN YOU'VE MISSED HIM LONG DE ROAD
3005-163399-0024 OH DON'T DISTRESS ME ANY MORE'N I'M ALWAY DISTRESSED
3005-163399-0025 WHY SILAS LOOK YONDER UP THE ROAD AIN'T THAT NOBODY COMING
3005-163399-0026 THE OLD GENTLEMAN STARED AND EXCLAIMED
3005-163399-0027 I HAIN'T NO IDEA WHO S IT
3005-163399-0028 IS THE TOM SAWYER
3005-163399-0029 BING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AN COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
3005-163399-0030 THERE I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES DOWN ON THAT BOAT
3080-5032-0000 BUT I AM HUGELY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN OUR LADY
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HIM BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN BUT THE WORST OF HER
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN COULD BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUMOR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
3080-5032-0003 WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AT A GARLAND
3080-5032-0004 WELL THE BEST ON'T IS THAT I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT WAS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGED
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITHAL AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR IT WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT I MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
3080-5032-0008 IT'S A STRANGE CHANGE AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS A SQUIRE OF DANE'S AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND TO SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CAN NOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0010 I THINK OUR YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH HIM
3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUTS THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I THINK YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY TO ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAVE HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTERS ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0014 BUT BESIDES THAT I CAN GIVE YOU OTHERS
3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH HER GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0016 YOU WILL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN SHE WAS
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY CLASP IT
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANYONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMOURS EVERY BODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBOURS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN AGAIN UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONE'S SELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PISTOL THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHALL YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
3080-5032-0022 I SEE NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER A DEBATE BUT MUCH MORE CALMLY
3080-5032-0024 AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LOST IT SINCE
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM CHEEK MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM YOUR COUSIN PETERS
3080-5032-0026 HOW QUIETLY DO I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHER'S IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
3080-5040-0000 WOULD IT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS AWAKENED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD US ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMASH
3080-5040-0003 I WONDER HOW SHE VALUED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL SIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE IN BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING TO BE MADE THE HAPPIEST THING ON EARTH
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT MORE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTERS TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN HE DESERVES

3080-5040-0016 I DO NOT FIND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED THAT YOU LOVED ME
3080-5040-0017 WHAT I AM CALLED UPON
3080-5040-0018 DIRECTED FOR YOUR DAUGHTER
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHID WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLES IN ME
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS THAN THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING YOU
3080-5040-0021 YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE AT THIS THAT I SHALL ESCAPE DROWNING
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WROTE BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS WITH MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0023 HOW WELCOME YOU' WILL BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT IT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGHED TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT ALL KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS WHEN WE HAVE NOTHING
3080-5040-0027 WHILE IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WAS TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
3080-5040-0028 WILL YOU BE SO GOOD NATURED THEN
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS A FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THUS WITH DISCOURSES IN THE FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER OCCASION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORTY WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OF HER AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE IS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASE CART WITH NINE PEAS IN IT UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS
3331-159605-0000 SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET UPON THE FENDER AND TOOK PADDLE INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
3331-159605-0001 THE MORE THE PROPOSALS THE MORE CREDIT
3331-159605-0002 I'VE TRIED IT AND LEFT IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK YOU AND I SAY YES
3331-159605-0004 WHAT A SPITEFUL THING I
3331-159605-0005 IF I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 LET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN AND
3331-159605-0007 HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HERS
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOUR OF ROMANCE INTO THE DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE UNDOUBTEDLY POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEAR IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF THEIR CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT HAD FLATTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON THE WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
3331-159605-0014 HE FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED PAUL'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BECKY AND BESS BUT COULD NOT RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR VAN THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DOG BUT YOU SEE MAGGIE WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASSA CHARLEY'S HAND MISS MAMMY AN WALK PRETTY LIKE BILLIE AND FLOSSIE SAID THE MAID
3331-159605-0019 AT THE STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOLBOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOLGIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHILE THEY MET
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY CAN NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE ROSY ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRENCHNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS NOT
3331-159605-0025 THANK YOU NO MORE
3331-159605-0026 HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONVICTION
3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FLED
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR BOB'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
3331-159605-0029 BUT WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BUOYANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A VIOLET LIKE LEVERLY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WENT ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVOURITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT MICHAEL HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 WORKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS TO YOU
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS SHE'LL SHOOT HIM
3331-159605-0035 BE UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PODDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT THE RUBBERS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS NOT HE HOPED
3331-159605-0038 DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO BE
3331-159605-0039 TRULY JULIE FEN
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE FRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID
3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRIED IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
3331-159605-0042 AND JUST GAVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO I'LL THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT SIDDY TATTLERS SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHATELAYMAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING OF YOU
3331-159605-0046 I'M ODD YOU KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAY
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WORLD TO WHITEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP ON THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THEY MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED FOR HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT HIS LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL ALL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NO NO I AM ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS IT AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS IN ME
3331-159609-0008 THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT I
3331-159609-0009 CRIED ELSIE WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0010 DEAR POLLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELL THE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKINGLY AND THEN I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO JEST BEFORE
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER IN ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATED THEIR RESPECTIVE VEREWS WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSS THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADMITTED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID FANNY TURNING HOPE OF ALL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE ARE ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF THE SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINTER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH HER GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SIDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THEM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING THROUGH A BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORES
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE DEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN AN UTTER DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY AND SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORKBASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE WRITE
3528-168656-0000 SHE HAD EVEN BEEN AT SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN SUCH NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR OF SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUCEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSCEBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOLGIRL WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS DROWN
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE WITH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE RULES OF FONTREVAL DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0006 SHE DID NOT SHOW THIS OBJECT TO ANYONE
3528-168656-0007 THUS THIS FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENT
3528-168656-0008 SOME UNIQUE CHAPLET OR SOME AUTHENTIC RELIC
3528-168656-0009 THEY LOST THEMSELVES IN THE CONJECTURES
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR LITTLE WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT THE DANCER IS LAUGHING WITH HIS SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0012 A MORAL LOVE CONQUERED BY THE COLIC
3528-168669-0000 THE PRIESTESS RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HER CHAIR
3528-168669-0001 WELL PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0002 FATHER FAUMENT
3528-168669-0003 MY REVEREND MOTHER DO YOU KNOW THE CHAPEL
3528-168669-0004 AND YOU WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
3528-168669-0005 BUT THERE IS A STONE TO BE RAISED HEAVY
3528-168669-0006 THE SLAP OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE WATER
3528-168669-0007 THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT AGAIN
3528-168669-0008 IT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR IT
3528-168669-0009 A WOMAN IS NEVER A DOG
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DAM BABYLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLONUS HORSES ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERANUS HORSES NEITHER DO I
3528-168669-0011 MERIT CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCKY
3528-168669-0012 AND A WOMAN HAS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0013 AND CAN YOU BE A LEVER
3528-168669-0014 THERE IS A RING IN THE SKY
3528-168669-0015 I WILL PUT THE LEVER FOR IT
3528-168669-0016 THAT'S GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I WILL OPEN THE VAULT
3528-168669-0017 WILL THAT BE ALL FOR
3528-168669-0018 GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS VERY REVEREND WIFE
3528-168669-0019 FAUVENCE WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
3528-168669-0020 BUT I AM HERE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WISH
3528-168669-0021 AND TO HOLD YOUR PEACE ABOUT EVERYTHING YES REVEREND MISTER
3528-168669-0022 WHEN THE BOLT IS OPEN I WILL CLOSE IT AGAIN
3528-168669-0023 BUT BEFORE THAT OF WHAT REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0024 FATHER COUVIN REVEREND MOTHER

3528-168669-0027 NOTHING CAN BE HEARD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN REALLY IT
3528-168669-0028 AND THEN A WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN MY DIRECTION THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0029 IT WAS MOTHER OF CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER HA
3528-168669-0031 THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I SEE
3528-168669-0032 A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM TOO OFTEN
3528-168669-0033 HE EY MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0034 WHAT DO YOU SAY IT
3528-168669-0035 I SAY MORE OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN WOULD
3528-168669-0036 REVEREND MOTHER I DID NOT SAY IT MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT I SAID MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0037 BUT I DID NOT THINK MORE OFTEN

3528-168669-0042 IN HER LIFETIME MOTHER CRUCIFIXION MADE CONVERTS AFTER HER DEATH SHE WILL PERFORM THE MIRACLES SHE WILL
3528-168669-0043 FATHER FAUVERIN THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0044 AND SHE RETAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT
3528-168669-0045 SHE GAVE IT HER LAST COMMANDS
3528-168669-0046 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HERSEL SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TEACHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0047 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT DUSK
3528-168669-0048 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT THAT IT WAS AN ORISON WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING
3528-168669-0049 FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE SHE WENT ON I
3528-168669-0050 I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABORING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPIED THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT
3528-168669-0051 FORTUNATELY THE PRIORESS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR US

3528-168669-0069 SHE ASKED IT OF YOU THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDED US
3528-168669-0070 BUT IT THAT IS FORBIDDEN
3528-168669-0071 OH I AM A STONE IN YOUR WOODS

3528-168669-0130 I WILL HAVE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 I GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THIS SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THIS SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUITING IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLIED IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF THEN REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A STONE POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NEVER GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN NINETY NINE A
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM UP THIRTY DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING CANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVED FRUITS BY SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN A STOVE OR OVEN UPON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMS AND FOOD PASTE ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THE PRESERVES OF A HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O FIVE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE DIRECTIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN O EIGHT S
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMALLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFORCET TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER AND THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE PAID AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 BUT HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVALS AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 I ISIS
3538-142836-0024 AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICE'S ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE SPATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT LIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE EATEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY THEIR FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT HIS NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTERS WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS A GIRL SAID THE HEAD
3538-163619-0004 AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM VERY BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACES
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT THE LAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND HE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY BROTHER DOING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 AT THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM HER
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON THEE OLD BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0012 BUT I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE HAD IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BEAR AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS AT THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOLDS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO THIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT YOU HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 SHE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 YET THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD BEEN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTIFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HONEST SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET HIS FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 FOR THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SYDRA LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND SINDER LADS SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID SINDERT
3538-163622-0013 I HAD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID SINDER LAD
3538-163622-0014 AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LITTLE WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE EVERYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NO I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID SINDER LAD
3538-163622-0017 IT ROSE LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SINDER LAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR THEY ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANY THING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW ENQUIRED THE WOLF SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 WELL THEN SAID THE FOAL DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE ARE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDER LIGHT
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW IT WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE OTHER KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 SO IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
3538-163624-0003 SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MOON AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS OFF
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS MY FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THAT PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND ONE THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REGN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD NOT DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE GIANT HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER A PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE IN IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS NOTHING FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FAFFERNER AND THEN STAFFNER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFFRON'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNNER ON A STEAK AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND KNOW ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINHILL SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOWS FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MUCH BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 AND THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 LIN BRUNHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAMES IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUNDRAN WERE BATHING BRUNHALD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRON'S SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME THEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST AT MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
367-130732-0000 LOMBSTERS AND LOBSTERS
367-130732-0001 WHEN IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER AND IT IS A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0002 THE QUESTION AND ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMARY OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSISTED THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN
367-130732-0004 A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN BY THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD WIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER ALE NEUBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DOMONICA

367-130732-0012 I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILST THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COASTS IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUSLY AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
367-130732-0013 GOBY'S PASSED WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN THE UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRETS OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBIES BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PRESTIGE DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
367-130732-0015 GOOBY'S CRAB STEW
367-130732-0016 TAKES THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT ALL THE FAT FROM THE SHELL

367-293981-0007 IF THEY DO NOT LET THEMSELVES BE SEEN THEY LET THEMSELVES BE FELT SAID SANCHO IF NOT LET MY SHOULDERS SPEAK TO A POINT
367-293981-0008 MINE DO SPEAK TOO SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT THAT IS NOT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT WHAT WE SEE IS THE ENCHANTED MOOR
367-293981-0009 THE OFFICER CAME TO HIM AND SAID WELL HOW GOES IT GOOD MAN
367-293981-0010 SANCHO GOT UP WITH PAIN ENOUGH IN HIS BONES AND WENT AFTER THE INN KEEPER IN THE DARK AND MEETING THE OFFICER WHO WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIS ENEMY HE SAID TO HIM SENOR WHOEVER YOU ARE DO US THE FAVOR AND KINDNESS TO GIVE US A LITTLE ROSEMARY OIL SALT AND WINE FOR IT IS WONT TO CURE ONE OF OUR BEST KNIGHTS ERRANT ON EARTH WHO LIES ON YONDER BED WOUNDED BY THE HANDS OF THE ENCHANTED MOOR THAT IS IN THIS INN
367-293981-0011 TO BE BRIEF HE TOOK THE MATERIALS OF WHICH HE MADE A COMPOUND MIXING THEM ALL AND BOILING THEM A GOOD WHILE UNTIL IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THEY HAD COME TO PERFECTION
367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT INTO THE PISKIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS WITH GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED IT DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER
367-293981-0014 IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT RETURNED SANCHO WOE BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KINDREDS WHY DID YOU LET ME TASTE IT
367-293981-0015 SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THIS KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU BY THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOU SATISFACTION IN A REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRE
367-293981-0016 AH THEN THIS IS AN INN SAID DON QUIXOTE
367-293981-0017 AND IN A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE SAID THE INNKEEPER
367-293981-0018 THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLANKETED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW ADVENTURE WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS BRIDE WHO UTTERED THEM
367-293981-0019 HE SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE LEFT HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
367-293981-0020 SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS CARRYING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THE BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
3764-168670-0000 THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROUDLY
3764-168670-0001 I COSETTE HAD WAKED UP
3764-168670-0002 JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED HER UNDER THE FIRE
3764-168670-0003 YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE I WILL COME TO FETCH YE
3764-168670-0004 EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED AND THEN NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
3764-168670-0005 I HAVE THE PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE GOT OUT
3764-168670-0006 THAT'S JUST WHERE THE DIFFICULTY LIES
3764-168670-0007 THIS IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THE CHILD YOU WILL CARRY HER OUT
3764-168670-0008 AND SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE I WILL ANSWER FOR THAT
3764-168670-0009 FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN VALJEAN IT
3764-168670-0010 YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE ME
3764-168670-0011 JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RAVENN
3764-168670-0012 FAUCHELEVENT WENT ON A
3764-168670-0013 IT IS TO THE MORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECTS YOU
3764-168670-0014 THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR A SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE COLONY
3764-168670-0015 THAT THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THE MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
3764-168670-0016 THAT THE PRIORESS AND THE VOCALS INTENDED TO FULFILL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
3764-168670-0017 THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THE CELL RAISE THIS STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
3764-168670-0018 AND THEN THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER THE EMPTY COFFINS
3764-168670-0019 WHAT IS THAT EMPTY TELEPHONE
3764-168670-0020 ASKED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENT RESPECT
3764-168670-0021 WHAT COFFIN WHAT ADMINISTRATION I
3764-168670-0022 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER HIS CHAIR YOU'
3764-168670-0023 YOU KNOW ME FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IS DEAD
3764-168670-0024 AND I ADD AND FATHER MADELEINE IS BURIED HER
3764-168670-0025 YOU' ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN FATHER MADELEINE
3764-168670-0026 THIS OFFERS THE MEANS GIVE US SOME INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
3764-168670-0027 HOW LONG IS THE COFFIN AND SIX FEET
3764-168670-0028 IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH WHAT THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0029 A CHURCH IN THE STREET THO THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
3764-168670-0030 HAVE YOU THE KEYS TO THOSE OLD DOORS
3764-168670-0031 NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PATER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKERS MEN TO ENTER WHILE THEY COME TO GET THE COFFIN
3764-168670-0033 WHO NAILS UP THE COFFIN I D
3764-168670-0034 AND SPREADS THE PAW OVER IT
3764-168670-0035 NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE FLOOR
3764-168670-0036 COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THAT ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN SOMEONE IS ASLEEP
3764-168670-0037 OF ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3764-168670-0038 I SHALL BE HUNGRY OR I WILL BRING YOU SOMETHING
3764-168670-0039 YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP TO THE COFFIN AT TWO O'CLOCK
3764-168670-0040 FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS FINGER JOINTS BUT THAT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
3764-168670-0041 MAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS IN A PLANK
3764-168670-0042 JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS AND THIS
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE SKULL
3764-168670-0044 WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A GOOD CURE
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE IT WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK ALONG LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0047 A MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE THEN
3764-168670-0048 WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO A CAT SO COME IN
3764-168670-0049 THE OVERPRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND IF THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
3764-168670-0050 BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED AND
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU'RE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I'M SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
3764-168670-0052 AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THAT GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0053 I SHALL FOLLOW THAT IT IS MY BUSINESS
3764-168670-0054 THE HEARSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKER MEN NOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0055 THIS PRIEST SAYS THE PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER BUT HE WILL NOT BE SOBER
3764-168670-0057 THAT IS SETTLED WHY FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL GO WELL
3764-168671-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAIN PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS AND CROSS BONES AND TEARS
3764-168671-0001 THIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE WHITE CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
3764-168671-0002 A MORNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOYS IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
3764-168671-0003 BEHIND IT CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABOURER WHO LIMPED AWAY
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING AND SUMMER AND AT NIGHT OF WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES
3764-168671-0006 DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT THE FLOWERS WERE DESERTERING IT
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VOUGEARG IT HINTED AT POVERTY PER LA CHAISE IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHEISE IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING A FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0009 THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN INTO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT WAS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENSE IN OUR SIGHT
3764-168671-0010 IT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE THEIR DUTY
3764-168671-0011 THE HUNS HAD COMMITTED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
3764-168671-0012 IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS RESPECTABLE
3764-168671-0013 GIVE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MEN BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES
3764-168671-0014 A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENT OF A PRINCIPLE
3764-168671-0015 FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG FROM BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0016 JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0017 OR WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESLAN
3764-168671-0019 HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS HUMOUR
3764-168671-0020 THE PERMISSION FOR INTERMENT MUST BE OBEYED
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT COAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0022 THE MAN REPLIED THEIR GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0023 THE GRAVE DIGGER EYES
3764-168671-0024 YOU I AM
3764-168671-0025 FATHER MESTUENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
3764-168671-0026 FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING NOTHING BUT THIS BUT A GRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE
3764-168671-0027 IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIGGERS DO DIE TO THEMSELVES
3764-168671-0028 THAT HE HAD HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STAMMER
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER MASTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER MILNOIR IS HERE'S A JUG OF RED WINE
3764-168671-0031 FOR YOU'RE A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
3764-168671-0032 ARE YOU NOT COMRADE YOU'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
3764-168671-0033 THE MAN HAD REPLIED
3764-168671-0034 HE LIMPED MORE OUT OF SOCIETY THAN FROM INFIRMITY
3764-168671-0035 THE GRAY DIGGER WALKED ON IN FRONT OF HIM
3764-168671-0036 FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED CREVALLIER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER HE LAUGHED
3764-168671-0038 YES SIR FATHER MATHIEN IS DEAD
3764-168671-0039 THE MAN REPLIED COMPLETELY PLEASED
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTEBOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHERMESTIENNE'S TURN FATHER MESTHIERNE DIED
3764-168671-0041 STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENTE IT IS MADE
3764-168671-0042 YOU ARE A PEASANT' I AM A PARISIAN
3764-168671-0043 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT I HAD LOST
3764-168671-0044 THERE ARE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUN'S CORNER
3764-168671-0045 AND HE ADDED WITH THAT SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS FEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE FRITINNIUM TOWN HALL
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD RESERVES HE HAD LOSSES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0049 SO WE ARE NOT A GRAVE DIGGER THEN
3764-168671-0050 RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS THEN
3764-168671-0051 HERE A REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY TO
3764-168671-0052 FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053 THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH A SUPERIOR SIGH
3764-168671-0054 ONE MUST LIVE
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE MAY WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING IT
3997-180294-0002 WELL GO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR THERE
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I WERE
3997-180294-0005 NOW GO I CAN'T KEEP MY HANDS OPEN
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING PARTY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING A SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BUT THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNCIL OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN THE GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY TAKE IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VEIL
3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNED UP THE HEART AND DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
3997-180294-0011 THEY LOVED BY PROFESSION NOT BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A LADY WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0013 THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF TO TAKE
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABOURERS IN THIS FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0015 THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVE YOU SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART SHALL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAYS OF MY LIAISSON
3997-180294-0018 WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAYETTY
3997-180294-0019 THE WOMAN BECOMES THE MAN'S MISTRESS OR LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 HOW WHEN
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS YOU HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO LAND AT THE VAUDEVILLE
3997-180294-0023 COME DURING THE THIRD ENTTRACT
3997-180294-0024 THE BOXES ARE FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY OF STAGE BOX
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN OPENED AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0027 WOULD SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING IN THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 YOU SHOULD GO TO BED HE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0030 WHERE AT COME
3997-180294-0031 YOU JUST LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK
3997-180294-0032 BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
3997-180294-0033 NONE THE LESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE CAPTAIN AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0000 I HAVE NOT COME HERE TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
3997-180297-0001 YE'RE IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVED
3997-180297-0003 DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME VERY ATTENTIVELY
3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT WE ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NAUGHT
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM TOUCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
3997-180297-0007 'S THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
3997-180297-0008 IF HERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
3997-180297-0009 HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREATER DEAL
3997-180297-0010 I HESITATED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0011 WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO CATCH
3997-180297-0012 I LISTENED AND I GAZED TO MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING MORE
3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DOUBTS AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTING DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 WE YOU NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017 WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEM LAST IN HIS ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER DO THEY GIVE YOU ADVICES WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRAS AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AND AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0021 I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH YE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVED AND KNEW WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THAT MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE TIRED OUT BY THIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0024 MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LOVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
3997-180297-0025 MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID HE
3997-180297-0026 HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT ABOUT
3997-180297-0027 I TORE HIS LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME
3997-180297-0028 LOOK LOOK HERE PRUDENCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID MARGUERITE

4198-12281-0005 LORD GOD DAMMY HE POTUM
4198-12281-0006 LET HIM BE CARRIED TO PRISON FOR TROUBLING THY DIVINE SERVICE
4198-12281-0007 WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN THE ADVENT AND ALL THE WATER

4198-12281-0010 TO SOME WITH THESE SMART SOUS ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDRIFTS WAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOME PUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
4198-12281-0011 BELIEVE THAT I WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER ONE SAW
4198-12281-0012 O THE HOLY LADY NITIT SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTUS O OUR LADY OF SUCCURS SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP

4198-12281-0014 CAN YOU TELL WITH WHAT IMPROVEMENTS THEY DID IT
4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEAN TIME FRIAR JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BANTON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHER BY THE ADHERENCE OF WHICH HE WAS GRADUALLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SHHADURAS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
4198-61336-0003 TIGLATH PELISER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE EURENTIAN ARMY IN CUMUC
4198-61336-0004 A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF ITS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN OUR RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING CHADORUS WHO LEAPT FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST URRUTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0007 THE SIFTI MATTI ILU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT CHARDORUS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTHERN SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TIGLATH BELEIZER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERN COUNTRY WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0010 ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATER ILIU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE FEDERALS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA
4198-61336-0012 IT FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 JEHUASH THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARD HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHERIM
4198-61336-0015 THIS USURPER HELD SWAY AT SUMERIA FOR ONLY A MINUTE
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MINUSHEIM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0017 TEGLATH PELISZER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTHEAST
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE COULD NOT PUT TO THE SWARD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS YURATA CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLATHPILLIZER RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0021 MINUHEIM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PEGAHIR
4198-61336-0022 JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT THIS INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0023 HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR ITS IDOLATRIES AND CRIED OH
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD INTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YE ME AND YE SHALL LIVE HAVE YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL
4198-61336-0025 THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES SHALL PERISH AND
4198-61336-0026 BUT ISRAEL WAS ALSO DEALT WITH
4198-61336-0027 HE HAD SWEPT THROUGH ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0028 THE PHILISTINES AND THE ARABIANS OF THE DESERT WERE ALSO SUPPLIED
4198-61336-0029 NO HE INVADED BABYLONIA
4198-61336-0030 UKINZER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITOL SCIPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0000 AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE ROOF I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGNING IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK BUT I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME ERROR
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THIS THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME THE LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BENDINELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR IF HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0005 I ASK NO FURTHER REWARD OF MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAVE IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IF IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FAVOR TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0008 I BEGGED HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM I HAD FIRST TAKEN IN
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GEORGIO DA CORTONA FIFTEEN YEARS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0010 GIORGIO CAME WITH THEM HIS HEALTH
4294-14317-0011 BUT I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUC ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LANDA WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGELLO
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS IN THE SCULPTOR'S CRAFT
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WE WASTED AND PIERO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-14317-0016 AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE REAL SCULPTOR
4294-14317-0017 THEN I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN LIFE I REACHED MY HOME
4294-32859-0000 WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY WELL
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THIS COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDLIN AND RETCHE'S PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BENEATH ME AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH SUCH PLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARKS FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THAT MIDDLE SUN WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY FRIENDS
4294-35475-0002 BUT AND THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE QUOTH
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN'S EYES AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY HAT WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRIB HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO MELANCHOLY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIVING HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST REND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH HUNG LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS THE DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 AND SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US FROM THE OGRE'S MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A STONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SLIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THE DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS FREEDOMS
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHEWS ME THE KEY HOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TIME TILL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE MUTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE FRENCH HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHEN HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR SERVANT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST I ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIEND
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OCHRE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRITO'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT ETHELRIDA HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE ISOOT
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN UP WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST WE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT WHEN HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO THE BATLIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE REAL LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF THAT DOUBT PAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO PREACH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESRANGE HIM FROM THEIR FATHER
4294-9934-0008 AND HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS THOUGHTS OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM UP ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU NOW SAID COURFEYRAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW AND
4294-9934-0014 SILVER GOLD HERE THIS IS

4294-9934-0016 THAT IT WILL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL IT DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU KNOW GERMAN YOU KNOW
4294-9934-0019 IT IS SADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR HER
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS TO THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S
4294-9934-0022 HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY SIX FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HELLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THIS SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARRIS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TOWN VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS AND GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIA SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT YOU HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THIS HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HER PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST HERSELF
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FAITH SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DEAR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCES WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS EXPLANATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALINGUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULIST PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
4350-10919-0009 YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED CITIZEN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKI BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE ER ON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED AH HE IS
4350-10919-0012 OH WELL THEN I WILL DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW MUCH A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH FOR LOWERING AND
4350-10919-0015 THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY IN RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCE
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES YOU HE ADDED
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS OR MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 OH TIME'S UP ALREADY THEN HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PRIEST ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THAT WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM IN KITTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE COUNT CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 NO SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO DANGER IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 AND THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFSE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD SEEN
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS THAT WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO APART THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY THE DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTORS HAD GONE
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THIS NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-9170-0001 THIS IS CERTAINLY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY WHICH IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY OUR MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASIS OF A AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006 THIS POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE HIS ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF PROGRESS
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS WHO TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010 SO INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS MUST THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN WITH POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VICE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL WORSE AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY A STRUGGLE IN CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES HIMSELF
4350-9170-0017 SO THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEARS ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF A GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST ELEMENT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIME SUBDUED BY CONFLICT
4350-9170-0022 SO IT HAS EVER BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRM IT
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND MEN WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POETS ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST AN ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ABNORMAL CONDITION OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THAT SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS LABOUR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THAT INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR LABORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES WITH THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITY PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN MOST MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERRENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD EVEN TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATE FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBOURS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO FEED
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF A WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE'S SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTIONS OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNORS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER A UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THIS
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN LIBERTY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THOUGH THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NONE
4350-9170-0049 NOT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME DAYS AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAVE MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR PEOPLES
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH THIS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS SHOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBOURS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER FROM SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING ON IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST COULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS OF OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A LARGE INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAY I KNOW SOMETHING
4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR' JACK AND SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 NO HE NEEDS A JOB BAN THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS
4852-28311-0003 O K HE ASKED
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM FOR YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN EMIL STREET
4852-28311-0006 WELL HE ADMITTED I DID THAT
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THAT HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 I THINK YOU REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THAT JOB FOR JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED AND
4852-28311-0011 BITCHIR AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED TO HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE DOORWAY
4852-28311-0013 OH SHUCK
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OUT ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE ALE SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK AT A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON TO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOCH SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GREY CLOUDS LOWERED AND DOUBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THE BOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND STIFFENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL AND REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY WINDOWS
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT A COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTRE THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GRAIN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAMES STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAS SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISS WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LEAVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOK HIM FROM HIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THAT ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001 BUT NOW ALONE UNTIL SOME ONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW FOR THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0003 HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO OTHER
4852-28312-0004 MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE ITS FACE
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE ON THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE AND THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0007 CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE ALL THERE
4852-28312-0008 CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO ME
4852-28312-0009 YES SIR HE ADDED
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A MAN WHO NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0011 HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF THE MIND
4852-28312-0012 JAKIE HARRIS'S NAME IS IN HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE BLESS WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYE
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BENEATH
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIEGG IS GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP ROUND THE CORNER OF WALTUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARDS THE THAPHIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018 THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY CHILL
4852-28312-0019 THEN FOR THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28312-0020 THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THEN BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHERES THE FREEWAY
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKE STACKS THE FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023 THE WAREHOUSERS WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN THIS DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLIT FEATURES
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS APPARENTLY AN INN
4852-28312-0027 THE COURTYARD WAS VASTLY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS THEN A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0029 A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO THE HALT BESIDE THE FLANGED COURTYARD
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COUCH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS IN POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28319-0000 THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS KEEN
4852-28319-0001 HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOXLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28319-0002 CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF UPON ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A POLE WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHOULD ALL TO DO FIRST
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY IN THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE IT
4852-28319-0007 MISTER WILLER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0008 THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER RIGGS SAID START AT ONCE
4852-28319-0009 THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND STRONGER
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELL FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT MISS BY
4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ONE THE TURN
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE AND CURVED IN POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0014 THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO KATE
4852-28319-0015 IF HE WAS TO BE A MAJOR COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE SAFE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0017 BUT HOW DID ONE OBTAIN INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
4852-28319-0018 JACK GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY IT RESUMED HIS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE AND INCREASED IN STORM
4852-28319-0021 DUSK CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARL IN THE SKY
4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURD AT THE PROPER TIME
4852-28319-0023 MISTER WORKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UP STAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKING AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCION FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND THEM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF A NEGRO BOY
4852-28319-0025 IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTING
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES THE WIDEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND AH THE FACE
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSEENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET THE BOUQUET FALL
4852-28330-0000 THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS THE FIRST
4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME UP THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ALBERT JONES WHO LOOKED OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPENED
4852-28330-0004 THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHITI AND
4852-28330-0005 WE'VE WATER AND FRESH DOORS TO TAKE ON THERE
4852-28330-0006 CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED A HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0007 CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING YOU
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINNEMORE WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO NOT TO DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERED
4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY AS I DO
4852-28330-0012 THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR BROTHER
4852-28330-0013 HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT PETER STANDING BEFORE HIM
4852-28330-0014 WE SHALL SEE NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE
4852-28330-0015 THE SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE YOUR HANDS
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY O SIR
4852-28330-0017 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND KEEN FACE CREASED IN ITS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0018 HE THEN WENT ON TO TRY WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0019 CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD WHICH THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0020 WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR RICHARD OUGHT TO ASK
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS THE CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CREW KNEW IT
4852-28330-0022 I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER BROOKER AND CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR
4852-28330-0025 TH CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
533-1066-0000 THEN CHURCHYARDS YAN
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED ON THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
533-1066-0002 I'M SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THEIR EXCITEMENT
533-1066-0003 FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR'S HALL AND THE LODGE
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOINTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0005 MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UPSTAIRS HOW ARE YOU NERVES TO NIGHT
533-1066-0006 I HAVE HAD NONE I SAID HAPPILY
533-1066-0007 I I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL
533-1066-0008 THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL TIME
533-1066-0009 SOMETIMES IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID
533-1066-0010 PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD LARGE CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
533-1066-0011 BUT LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
533-1066-0012 THEY WERE TALKING COPENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
533-1066-0013 THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AND TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0014 I ASKED NO ONE QUESTIONS
533-1066-0015 ONCE ONLY HE SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STUART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE
533-1066-0016 I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED AND
533-1066-0017 THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SLOWLY WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT
533-1066-0018 I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A PAINFUL SPOT
533-1066-0019 BUT IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN SHARPLY
533-1066-0020 IT WAS ALSEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES
533-1066-0021 THE DOCTOR KEPT A KEEN LOOK OUT THAT NO ONE APPEARED
533-1066-0022 THERE'S ONE THING SURE SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY
533-1066-0023 A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT TILING THEM UP
533-1066-0024 I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT IN THERE AND LOOKED DOWN
533-131556-0000 FOR HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY GO
533-131556-0001 AND NONE COULD ENDURE ME AS HE HAS DONE OH
533-131556-0002 THE WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUTH I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES AS WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
533-131556-0004 I HAVE DONE NOTHING TO RECORD THEM SO MINUTELY
533-131556-0005 THEY HAD BETAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION I HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK
533-131556-0006 I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF THIS
533-131556-0007 UPON PERUSING THIS I TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP
533-131556-0008 YOU MAY GO MILICENT AS SHE'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT
533-131556-0009 WILL ULL OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE
533-131556-0010 HER YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS
533-131556-0011 IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE
533-131556-0012 I ENJOY A MOONLIGHT RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THE THRUBBERY HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RESORTS
533-131556-0013 SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER FOREHEAD AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
533-131556-0014 I HAD WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
533-131556-0015 YES YES THAT
533-131556-0016 SUPPOSE I KNOW
533-131556-0017 SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SAY
533-131556-0018 YOU CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
533-131556-0019 IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL WHETHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR ADEPTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
533-131556-0020 I CANNOT TELL HIM
533-131556-0021 GIVE ME NO THANKS IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I COMPLAIN
533-131556-0022 AND MILICENT WILL YOU TRY HER
533-131556-0023 I WOULD NOT FOREMUCH THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF HER RELATION
533-131556-0024 YOU USE LARGE WORDS MISSUS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU
533-131556-0025 HOW DARE TO MENTION HIS NAME TO ME
533-131562-0000 IT IS VERY INTERESTING LOVE SAID HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO WHERE I STOOD WRINGING MY HANDS IN SILENT RAGE AND ANGUISH BUT IT'S RATHER LONG I'LL LOOK AT IT SOME OTHER TIME AND MEANWHILE I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KISS MY DEAR WHAT KISS
533-131562-0001 ALL THE KEYS OF YOUR CABINET DESK DRAWER AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
533-131562-0002 THE KEY OF MY VESTED IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
533-131562-0003 NOW THEN SNEERED HE WE MUST HAVE A CONFISCATIONS OF PROPERTY
533-131562-0004 AND PUTTING A KEYS INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY
533-131562-0005 THAT AND ALL REPLIED HER MASTER AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
533-131562-0006 MISTER HUNTINGDON THEN WENT BACK STAIRS
533-131562-0007 MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE'S VERY DEAD FOR A SPITE
533-131562-0008 I DIDN'T SAY I'D BROKEN IT DID I RETURNED I

533-131562-0010 AND AS FOR OTHER HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREEBS MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO UP ON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN
533-131562-0011 WHAT GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE I MADE NOW MISTER HUNTINGDON

533-131562-0013 NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEM BUT IT'S BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
533-131562-0014 HERE BENSON ENTERED THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENTLY TRIUMPHING IN MY PRAYER
533-131562-0015 I KNOW NOW THAT DAY AFTER DAY SUCH FEELINGS WILL RETURN UPON ME
533-131562-0016 I TRY TO LOOK TO HIM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT THAT WILL CLEAVE TO THE DUST
533-131564-0000 VAIN OH I FEAR

533-131564-0003 I CAN'T YOU CAN'T WANT HIM DO YOU
533-131564-0004 IT IS A RESOLUTION YOU NOT FORMED LONG AGO
533-131564-0005 WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF A LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS THOUGH WE CANN'T RESPECT HIM
533-131564-0006 NO I'D RATHER BE LIKE MYSELF THAN AS I'M

533-131564-0017 I SOUGHT OUT AND PUT INTO HIS HAND TWO OF MILICENT'S LETTERS ONE DATED FROM LONDON AND WRITTEN DURING ONE OF HIS WILDEST SEASONS OF RECKLESS DISSIPATION THE OTHER IN THIS COUNTRY DURING A LUCID INTERVAL
533-131564-0018 THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMM'S B AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENUOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON THE OTHER MAN'S SHOULDERS
533-131564-0019 I'VE BEEN A CURSED RASCAL GOD KNOWS SAID HE AS HE GAVE IT AN EARTHY SQUEEZE BUT YOU SEE IF I DON'T MAKE AMENDS FOR IT ME IF I DON'T

533-131564-0025 CRIED SHE I COULDN'T HAVE INFLUENCED HIM I'M SURE BY ANYTHING WHICH I COULD HAVE SAID
533-131564-0026 YOU NEVER HAVE TRIED ME MILLY SAID HE
533-131564-0027 AFTER THAT THEY WILL REPAIR TO THEIR COUNTRY ROOM
5442-32873-0000 MISTER LAKE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE A LONDON DANDIE NOW
5442-32873-0001 THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND A WILD LURE IN HIS YELLOW EYES RACHEL SAT THERE
5442-32873-0002 HER SLAVE ONLY THINK A SLAVE
5442-32873-0003 THOUGH FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL IS IT A DREAM
5442-32873-0004 A FRIGHTFUL TRIFLE
5442-32873-0005 STANLEY STANLEY IT WOULD BE MERCY TO KILL ME SHE BROKE HERSELF AGAIN
5442-32873-0006 BRIGHT AND GNATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND A PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH HIS BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF A SAGE HER PILLOW SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
5442-32873-0007 WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TORCOT BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
5442-32873-0008 BUT THERE WAS NOTHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE PROCESS
5442-32873-0009 THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY THEN GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM
5442-32873-0010 AND SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GRASS
5442-32873-0011 RACHAEL LEAK RACHEL LAKES WHAT ARE YOU NOW
5442-32873-0012 I'LL STAY HERE THIS IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-32873-0013 HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGERETT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0014 LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKINS'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WILDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOLL CART FOR MIKE BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AN DOLL CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
5442-32873-0015 BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LINE WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARDS THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGTON
5442-32873-0016 HERE WERE A FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELLED DEEP IN THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
5442-32873-0017 LOSE NO TIME FOR I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A CRUMB
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STUCK OPEN HIS GREASY WIDE AWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOLL CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT THAT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TAMAR
5442-41168-0000 THE OBJECT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER END HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COARSE SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND WROUGHT IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR OTTO OR BALLOT
5442-41168-0004 WE SHEDDING OUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF A MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE'S NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 VOTES PLEASE P E N
5442-41168-0007 THEY EXPECT THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOVE FLERROFF SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLORAFF'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAS A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS TO THE REFRESHMENT BAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY THE GRAY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHEWED A SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JURED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERJIY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0014 SERGEA IVANOVITCH FROWNED
5442-41168-0015 THAT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN IDEAS HE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT TO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0017 A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETY FOUR AGAINST
5442-41168-0018 SANG THROUGH THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
5442-41168-0019 THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO KNOTS WERE FOUND ON A BOX
5442-41168-0020 BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERIOUS
5442-41168-0021 IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUSTS THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAYS BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 YET THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE
5442-41168-0024 AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH HER SIDE DOOR
5442-41168-0025 THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY INTO THE ELECTION
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNETSKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT FLERFF TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMEN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZTHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS SAID AROUND HIM
5442-41169-0002 HE'S SUCH A BLACK
5442-41169-0003 I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF ME
5442-41169-0004 THESE TWO PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY YOU FINE CHAMPAGNE
5442-41169-0006 THE LAST YEAR AT OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S
5442-41169-0007 OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS A LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
5442-41169-0008 WHY WHAT IS THERE TO WONDER
5442-41169-0009 THERE IS NO REASON IN IT AT ALL
5442-41169-0010 THEN TOO ONE MUST KEEP IN CONNECTIONS
5442-41169-0011 IT'S A REAL OBLIGATION OF A SORT
5442-41169-0012 AND WHEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE'S ONE'S OWN INTERESTS
5442-41169-0013 THEY ARE PROPRIETORS OF A SOD BUT THEY ARE THE LANDOWNERS
5442-41169-0014 THAT IT MAY BE BUT NOW IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LAYING OUT A GARDEN CLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THAT VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND HOW IS YOUR LAMB DOING
5442-41169-0017 BUT ONE'S WORK'S THROWN IN FOR NOTHING
5442-41169-0018 NO WELL ONE DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0019 AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS INTO THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 STILL THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES IT
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN BASILEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 BUT TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THAT LIME TREE
5442-41169-0023 HERE YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BALK
5442-41169-0024 YOU'RE MARRIED I' HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER
5442-41169-0025 YES IT'S RATHER STRANGE YOU WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 AND LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MOUSTACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR PAGS FOR TUMBLE
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNING FOR A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE'S A CLASSED INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND YOU CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A REPLY TOO AT A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 AND WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HERMONN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRATES
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD HEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THAT ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITION
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLES
5484-24317-0005 HE HAD LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUED DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTIELUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH WOULD ARISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 AND HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAS RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMANN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATIUS IN THIS PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSEN
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGN AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELT CHILLED AMONG THE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 CORTES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICHO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENO'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSIMARCHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HARMON INCREDULATELY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES AND TIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISE ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THE WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMYNTS THE LIEGE CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLIS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE COLOUR PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSINOT IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING AND THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED ME
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED THE HERMANN
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENHAUL HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL OLD LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HERMAND LISTEN TO THE PAIR IN SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENAU ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRETEZ HERMANN'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMEANOR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT
5484-24317-0029 A MAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMANDEN'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INNOCENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WAS STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THO SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNAS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS A NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND AND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMANN PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY ARE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE BROUGHT TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND WOMAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN END AS A BOOM ON THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0005 DID SHE NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER THING
5484-24318-0007 AS HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMANN WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AND ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTZ AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDNESS DEITY
5484-24318-0010 YET IT WAS NO ILLUSION HAD DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HER BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT THE UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER BROTHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERRIMANE IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED ME TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPA SILENCED HER WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE PRINCE
5484-24318-0017 AND SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD WITH HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOR EVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALAESTRO THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I DO LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALWAYS
5484-24318-0021 DAPHNE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY FOR WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERRIMANN WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THAT DEMETER IS THE WORKER MYRTELUS
5484-24318-0024 WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL IT AWAITS YOU
5484-24318-0025 AND I FEEL BLINDED ALSO IN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL AND PALLIATE NOTHINGS
5484-24318-0027 SOACIUS INTENDED TO LEAVE THAT CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HAD HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMIN TEZ THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE SAW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
5484-24318-0031 AND ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROPPED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACK GROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH THE JUST DUE
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERONN
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATULUS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HERIBONN
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED WITH THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOR TO MYRTELLUS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FEASTAL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMPS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THIS GOD GAVE RAIN AND HARVESTS
5764-299665-0001 WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND MYSELF AND
5764-299665-0002 WHETHER ANY PRAYER WAS EVER ANSWERED AND
5764-299665-0003 WHY DID HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUAL INFERIORITY
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID YOU CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0005 ARE OUR FAILURES UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0006 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED BY ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH A LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOWED UPON THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0008 IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITIONS FOR THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0009 DID THIS GOD ALOAD THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0010 DID HE ILLOWA TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0011 CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL BASED ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DIVORRE HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE BANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE SPEEDS ON LIFE
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NERVE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
5764-299665-0015 FEAR BUILDS THE ALTAR AND OFFERS HER SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0016 FEAR ERECTS HER CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0017 LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT ITS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0018 CAN WE SAY THAT I CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
5764-299665-0019 CAN YOU SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDURETH FOREVER
5764-299665-0020 DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THE THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0021 WAS HIS GOODNESS WAS THERE WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0022 OUGHT THE SUPERIOR RACE TOO TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THE INFERIOR
5764-299665-0023 MOST OF PEOPLE CLING TO THE SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0024 IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINES ANOTHER
5764-299665-0025 WHAT IS IT THIS POWER
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARY ADVANCES TRUE EXPERIENCE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE TURNED TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0028 HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND HE KNOWS THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPED IT WITH HIS DIMPLED ARM
5764-299665-0030 THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAD TAUGHT THE CHILD HIS LESSON
5764-299665-0031 IT IS A RESULTS
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT SCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0033 WE LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONALS
5764-299665-0034 THEY ARE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED TOO
5764-299665-0035 AND THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MORAL
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD PEOPLE
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAD SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LAW
5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0039 THE IMAGINATION IS CULTIVATED IT
5764-299665-0040 A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PALACE OF ANOTHER
5764-299665-0041 THE SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE AND
5764-299665-0042 BUT JUDGES HIMSELF
5764-299665-0043 IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL IN
5764-299665-0044 MAN HAS BEEN DECEIVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HES CHRISTIANITY DAN GUND
5764-299665-0046 WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL THE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY OUR AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN WORTH WITHOUT RELIGIOUS
5764-299665-0049 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD HE HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0050 WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DO OF THEM
5764-299665-0051 THEY THEN HATED PLEASURE
5764-299665-0052 THEY HAD MUFFLED ALL THE BELLS OF GLADNESS
5764-299665-0053 THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN HAS AN UNADULTERATED CURSE
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND RAPID
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON THE HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLES KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLICISM
5764-299665-0058 HAS THE BIBLE MADE THIS PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES BUT FAILED
5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND FACT
5764-299665-0061 RELIGION HAS NEVER MADE MEN FAIR
5764-299665-0062 IT HAS NEVER MADE THAT MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
5764-299665-0063 ARE OUR CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARER HONEST THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0064 CAN WE CURE DISEASE DISEASE BY SUPPLICATION
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUES OR HONOR AS ALMS
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS UPON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT THIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE TORN THE STONES
5764-299665-0068 THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A BAS RELIEF
5764-299665-0069 IF WE BUILD WE MAY BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM
5764-299665-0070 I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER LINES
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST MAN IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNERSTONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM ENDS TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED WHICH THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN BACK OF MATTER AND CHANCE
5764-299665-0075 I SAY WHAT I MEAN
5764-299665-0076 EVERY EVENT HAS PARENTS PARENTS
5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED COULD NOW
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INDEFINITE CHAINED THIS AND THE CAMP BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
5764-299665-0079 AND WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0080 WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEING NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE MOST THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELLED
5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF ADVANCE THERE HAVE BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0083 FOR THE THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE THE REFORMERS FAILS
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND UPON THE LOT ON LUCK AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR PRICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0087 FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURAL NATURE WHY
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PRODUCES WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHTS
5764-299665-0089 MUST THIS WORLD FOREVER REMAIN THE VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE A BURDEN AND CURSES FOR
5764-299665-0091 PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN BUT
5764-299665-0092 LAW CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT A CRIME
5764-299665-0093 THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY DOGS OR EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0094 THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF OUR WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0095 THIS FREE TO WOMEN
5764-299665-0096 TO POVERTY AND CRIME WILL BE CHILDLESS
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FAULTS AND BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THAT FUTURE WITH A SMILE
6070-63485-0000 THERE DUN FAR SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOWER KEY TO THE CHOUETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE
6070-63485-0001 THE TWO MONSTERS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HORSES
6070-63485-0002 BY MEANS OF THIS STRATAGEM THEY FOLLOWED SO CLOSELY THAT ALTHOUGH WITHIN A FEW STEPS OF SARAH AND TOM THEY DID NOT HEAR IT
6070-63485-0003 SARAH AND HER BROTHER HAVING AGAIN PASSED BY THE TUPPY FRANC HAD ARRIVED CLOSE TO THE DILAPIDATED HOUSE WHICH WAS PARTLY IN RUINS AND ITS OPEN CELLARS FORMED A KIND OF GULF ALONG WHICH THE STREET RAN IN THAT DIRECTION
6070-63485-0004 IN AN INSTANT THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH A LEAP RESEMBLING IN STRENGTH AND AGILITY THE SPRING OF A TIGER SEIZED SATON WITH ONE HAND BY THE THROAT AND EXCLAIMED YOUR MONEY OR I WILL FLING YOU INTO THIS HOLE
6070-63485-0005 NO SAID THE OLD BRUTE GRUMBLINGLY NO NOT ONE RING WHAT A SHARE
6070-63485-0006 TOM SEYTON DID NOT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND DURING THIS SCENE RAPIDLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AS IT HAD APPEARED
6070-63485-0007 UH AH TO LAY A TRAP TO CATCH US REPLIED THE THIEF
6070-63485-0008 THEN ADDRESSING THOMAS SEYURN YOU KNOW THE PLAN OF SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0009 DID YOU SEE IN THE CABARET WE HAD JUST LEFT FOR I KNOW YOU AGAIN THE MAN WHOM THE CHARCOALMAN CAME TO SEEK
6070-63485-0010 CRIED THE SCHOOLMASTER A THOUSAND FRANCS THEN I'LL KILL HIM
6070-63485-0011 WRETCH I DO NOT SEEK HIS LIFE RETURNED SARAH TO THE SCHOOLMASTER
6070-63485-0012 LET'S GO AND CALL HIM
6070-63485-0013 OLD BYE IT WILL BE FOR LOOKING AFTER
6070-63485-0014 WELL MY WIFE SHALL BE THERE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER YOU SHALL TELL HER WHAT YOU WANTS AND I SHALL SEE
6070-63485-0015 IN THE REGION OF SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0016 BETWEEN SAINT OIN AND THE ROAD OF LA RIVETTE AT THE END OF THE ROAD AGREED
6070-63485-0017 HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS OF THE SELF STYLED FAN PAYTER
6070-63485-0018 THE FIECAS STARTED
6070-86744-0000 FRANZ WHO SEEMED ATTRACTED BY SOME INVISIBLE INFLUENCE ACROSS THE COUNT IN WHICH TERROR WAS STRANGELY MINGLED FELT AN EXTREME RELUCTANCE TO PERMIT HIS FRIEND TO BE EXPOSED ALONE TO THE SINGULAR FASCINATION THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE SEEMED TO EXERCISE OVER HIM AND THEREFORE MADE NO OBJECTION TO ALBERT'S REQUEST BUT AT ONCE ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DESIRED SPOT AND AFTER A SHORT DELAY THE COUNT JOINED THEM IN THE SALON
6070-86744-0001 MY VERY GOOD FRIEND AN EXCELLENT NOBLE REPLIED THE COUNT WITH A SMILE YOU REALLY EXAGGERATE MY TRIFLING EXERTIONS
6070-86744-0002 MY FATHER THE COMTE DE MORCERF ALTHOUGH OF SPANISH ORIGIN POSSESSES CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE BOTH AT THE COURT OF FRANCE AND MADRID AND I UNHESITATINGLY PLACE THE BEST SERVICES OF MYSELF AND OF ALL TO WHOM MY LIFE IS DEAR AT YOUR DISPOSAL
6070-86744-0003 I CAN SCARCELY CREDIT IT THAT
6070-86744-0004 THEN IT IS SETTLED SAID THE COUNT AND I GIVE YOU MY SOLEMN ASSURANCES THAT I ONLY WAITED AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THE PRESENT TO REALISE PLANS THAT I HAVE LONG MEDITATED
6070-86744-0005 SHALL WE MAKE A POSITIVE MOVEMENT FOR A PARTICULAR DAY AND HOUR INQUIRED THE COUNT ONLY LET ME WARN YOU THAT I AM PROVERBIAL FOR MY PUNCTILIOUS EXACTITUDE IN KEEPING MY ENGAGEMENTS DAY FOR DAY HOUR FOR HOUR SAID ALBERT THAT WILL SUIT ME TO A DOT
6070-86744-0006 SO BE IT THEN REPLIED THE COUNT AND EXTENDING HIS HAND TOWARDS THE CALENDAR SUSPENDED FROM THE CHIMNEY PIECE HE SAID TO DAY IS THE TWENTY FIRST OF FEBRUARY AND DRAWING OUT HIS WATCH ADDED IT IS EXACTLY HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK NOW PROMISE ME TO REMEMBER THIS AND EXPECT ME THE TWENTY FIRST OF MAY AT THE SAME HOUR IN THE FORENOON
6070-86744-0007 I RESIDE IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE BUT OCCUPY A PAVILION AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE COURTYARD AND TILE IS SEPARATED IT FROM THE MAIN BUILDING
6070-86744-0008 NOW THEN SAID THE COUNT RETURNING HIS TABLETS TO HIS POCKET MAKE YOURSELF PERFECTLY EASY THE HAND OF YOUR TIMEPIECE WILL NOT BE MORE ACCURATE IN MARKING THE TIME THAN HIMSELF
6070-86744-0009 THAT DEPENDS WHEN DO YOU LOVE
6070-86744-0010 FOR FRANCE THOUGH FOR VENICE I SHALL REMAIN IN ITALY FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO
6070-86744-0011 THEN YOU SHALL NOT MEET IN PARIS
6070-86744-0012 I FEAR I SHALL NOT HAVE THAT MANNER
6070-86744-0013 WELL PRINCE WE MUST PART SAID THE COUNT HOLDING OUT A HAND TO EACH OF THE YOUNG MEN ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU BOTH A SAFE AND PLEASANT JOURNEY
6070-86744-0014 WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED ALBERT OF FRANCE WHEN THEY HAD RETURNED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS THAT YOU SEEM MORE THAN COMMONLY THOUGHTFUL
6070-86744-0015 I WOULD CONFESS TO YOU ALBERT REPLIED FRANZ THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0016 DID YOU EVER MEET HIM PREVIOUSLY TO TURNING HITHER
6070-86744-0017 UPON MY HONOR THEN LISTEN TO HIM
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY IN THE ALMOST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAM AND HOW ON HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YACHT SEEN IN THE DISTANT HORIZON DRIVING UNDER FULL SAIL TOWARD PORTO VECCHIO
6070-86744-0019 THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISE TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86744-0020 BUT SAYS FRANTZ THE CORSICAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSEL
6070-86744-0021 WHAT REALLY THE THING SEEMS TO ME SIMPLE ENOUGH
6070-86744-0022 TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DOES HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT WERE THE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINGTURED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY
6070-86744-0023 CERTAINLY THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IN YOUR PLACE I SHALL LIKE TO HAVE ANSWERED
6070-86744-0024 MY DEAR FRANTZ REPLIED ALBERT WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELPS ME TO DELIVER HIM
6070-86744-0025 WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT IS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY IS HE A STATE
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESS HE CALLED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SENOR VAMPA WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASE AND UNCONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ALBERT'S SIDE
6070-86744-0028 WELL WELL SAID FRANZ WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT FOR YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND MY POWERS OF REFUTATION
6070-86744-0029 AND NOW MY DEAR FRANK LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
6070-86745-0000 THEN SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY THE MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND COURT THESE TWO APPARENTLYS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0002 AT A QUARTER TO TEN A VALET ENTERED HE COMPOSED WITH A LITTLE GROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ALWAYS SPOKE ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASSEUR ALSO
6070-86745-0003 WAIT THEN DURING THE DAY TELL ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE DESIRED
6070-86745-0004 VERY WELL AT HALF PAST THREE
6070-86745-0005 IS THE COUNTESS UP THERE
6070-86745-0006 THE VALET LEFT THE ROAD
6070-86745-0007 GOOD MORNING LUCIEN GOOD MORNING SAID ALBERT YOUR PUNCTUALITY REALLY ALARMED ME
6070-86745-0008 YOU WHOM I EXPECTED LAST YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIXED AT HALF PAST
6070-86745-0009 NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW DO NOT CONDEMN OUR PLANS
6070-86745-0010 NOW HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGES IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTH
6070-86745-0011 IT IS FOR THAT REASON YOU SEE ME SO UGLY
6070-86745-0012 I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO HAVE A RIDE OR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 PESTS I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT YOU COULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE
6070-86745-0014 BESIDES THAT DOES NOT CONCERN THE HEAD BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
6070-86745-0015 ABOUT WHICH ABOUT THE PAPERS
6070-86745-0016 IS IN THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE GREEN
6070-86745-0018 COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIEN
6070-86745-0019 WITH YOUR TALENTS YOU MUST MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THAT VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
6128-63240-0001 THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE MAN
6128-63240-0002 SHE IS NOT WILLING TO RISK THAT
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORKAWAY ASPECT
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF THIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEART AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL DESK OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE IS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSES OF THE COTTON FIELD
6128-63240-0009 AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN INTENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPALES AND ROARING RADICALS
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MURDER MURDER
6128-63240-0012 HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUONER WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6128-63240-0013 SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE RATHER
6128-63240-0014 HAVE YOU BEEN IN AMERICA
6128-63240-0015 NO THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES IT THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION HOWEVER TO MISSUS LENA
6128-63240-0018 ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE TO
6128-63240-0019 AND LADY LENA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0020 ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FROM
6128-63240-0021 PERHAPS OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BUSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0022 THAT WAS THE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND MORE SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED THE SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GIFT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNEY'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND DEEP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0026 I WILL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A THEATER PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LUNEY'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSLY THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO A OE OTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIMES AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNU'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002 RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT COMPANY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MAKE HER TRAGIC
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE IT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED IN ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE CONSTITUTION OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN ON ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WILL BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0009 OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR IS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010 AND SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS THAT HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0012 AND HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COSTS HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BAZER RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF HATH THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE HIM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE LADIES ON BEACON STREET FEEL UPON THE BALLOT
6128-63244-0002 PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR MANY OTHERS
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY OF REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
6128-63244-0004 OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIFE THERE WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0005 ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FAMENDER WHO LIVED AT RAXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINGERS HAD SUPPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0007 SHE WISHED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PLACE
6128-63244-0008 THIS MIGHT APPEAR ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0009 CHARLIE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WHITE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS TO HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH THE MOST
6128-63244-0010 OLIVE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MISSUS FERRINGER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
6128-63244-0011 IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINK
6128-63244-0012 OUR MOVEMENT WAS FOR ALL IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
6128-63244-0013 RAISE THE STANDARD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME YOUR HUNDRED NAMES
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BRICK CURRANTS MISSUS FARRENDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0015 SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSION IN HIS RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0016 I WARN'T TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THEIR SEX OF EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
6128-63244-0018 IN THE UNHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
6128-63244-0019 THEY WERE HER SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY FOR THEIR DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT AND JUST REVOLUTION IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTAL BLOODSTAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0021 THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMEN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE OF IT
6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SOMEWISE MIST OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY IS SUCCESS
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS HERBERT'S EYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEM ALREADY A MARTYR
6128-63244-0024 OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG AND UNREWARDED WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OF AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES OF AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
6432-63722-0000 BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YOU FIGURE ON DOIN SOME DETECTIN AND GIVEN UP FISHING
6432-63722-0001 AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD GIVEN
6432-63722-0002 I'M GOING OFF FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING AND I MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
6432-63722-0003 GET READY SHAG YASSEE COLONEL
6432-63722-0004 AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HAD HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF A EAST INDIAN
6432-63722-0005 PINKUS AND DONOVAN HAVEN'T THEY CARROLL YEH UP
6432-63722-0006 CAROL IS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
6432-63722-0007 ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON THAT CASE SIR
6432-63722-0008 THEN HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT COLONEL THAN THAT CAT
6432-63722-0009 PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED THE COLONEL ASHLEY
6432-63722-0010 WE'VE GOT OUR DAY AND THAT'S ALL WE WANT
6432-63722-0011 YOU'RE ON THE STAIRS CASE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YES
6432-63722-0012 I'M WRITING IN THE INTEREST OF THE YOUNG MAN
6432-63722-0013 IT'S JUST ONE O THEM COINCIDENCES LIKE THAT
6432-63722-0014 BUSTED HIS HEAD IN LIKE A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE OF A PAIR
6432-63722-0015 GAD EXPLAINED THE CORPORAL
6432-63722-0016 THE VERY FACT I WAS GOING TO BUY
6432-63722-0017 AND LOOK HERE COLONEL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
6432-63722-0018 AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOR AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGA FUUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63722-0020 NOW I'M AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPENED
6432-63722-0021 PHUTE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED CHIR ALI
6432-63722-0022 ANYHOW HE AND TRUD DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL IT SEEMS
6432-63722-0023 NEIGHBOURS OFTEN HEARD EM SCRAPPIN A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
6432-63722-0024 THROUGHOUT DARK A MAN WENT IN TO BUY A LAMP
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND HERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND THIS HEAVY CANDLESTICK NEAR IT
6432-63722-0026 SHE HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
6432-63722-0027 MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOES TALKED ON THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBOURS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0028 AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT YES HE'S HERE

6432-63722-0031 AND DONALMIN'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SCEPTICAL
6432-63722-0032 YES IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUGH HEDGES ON IT
6432-63722-0033 THEN I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
6432-63722-0034 IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE IS A BIT
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHED A COLONEL
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE LONG TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FIGURE TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL
6432-63722-0038 AND DONONOVAN TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
6432-63722-0039 ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVES YES

6432-63722-0046 WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF I GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0047 RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITIONS
6432-63722-0048 AT BEST YOU WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0049 AND HE I DON'T WANT IT EITHER
6432-63722-0050 BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I DO

6432-63722-0059 AND THERE'S NO REASON THAT YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW
6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILLFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOKS
6432-63723-0001 AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDING PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
6432-63723-0002 THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENNETH A
6432-63723-0003 SO I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT
6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN MY CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
6432-63723-0005 WELL I DON'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN
6432-63723-0006 IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAVE LEFT HIM
6432-63723-0007 IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED FRIGHTENED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE TO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0009 THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIMSELF
6432-63723-0010 AARON GRAFTON'S DEPARTMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED
6432-63723-0011 HE OBSERVED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012 SHE SAID HE HAD CUT HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0013 SINCE LARCH MADE NO DEFENCE
6432-63723-0014 LARCH FOR REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND I DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL FEE
6432-63723-0016 NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT FOR HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0017 AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO BRING IT UP
6432-63723-0018 BUT STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE ALTHOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELLER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0020 IT HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SAY
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALLROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE LOWER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
6432-63723-0022 LARSH HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
6432-63723-0023 IN A SMALLER PLACE I WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
6432-63723-0024 AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RACH HAD MARRIED
6432-63723-0025 TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER THEY WHISPERED MONEY
6432-63723-0026 THAT IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE
6432-63723-0027 SHE ALSO SAW HER OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
6432-63723-0028 AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANTLY GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
6432-63723-0029 THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC INSIDE HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
6432-63723-0030 BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WAS WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
6432-63723-0031 IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASES AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL
6432-63723-0032 MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND WITH THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING TO BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
6432-63723-0033 DON'T WONDER IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0034 I AM GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT IT WILL TAKE A TIME
6432-63723-0035 IT'S HARD FOR MISS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP AS A MAJOR
6432-63723-0036 SO KING GOT BAIL SO PUT IT UP
6432-63723-0037 IT WAS HIGHME LARCH
6432-63723-0038 THEY TOOK HARRY ALWAYS A WHILE AGO
6432-63723-0039 BUT HIS ARE PRETTY UNCERTAIN SHOES TO BE WITH JUST THE SAME
6432-63723-0040 ONLY THAT I WOULD DARCY HESITATED AND GREW RED
6432-63723-0041 GOOD EVENING COLONEL HE CALLED GENIALLY WILL YOU JOIN ME IN A WELSH ROBIN
6432-63723-0042 THANK YOU NOEL

6432-63723-0044 WELL AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE STORE ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER
6432-63723-0045 THE STOPPED CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU AN THEORY

6432-63723-0050 I HAD SAID I WAS GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY THOUGH WITH AN EFFORT
6432-63723-0051 WHY POLONIUS WHAT ONE ASKED
6432-63723-0052 WHY DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
6432-63723-0053 THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THAT MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
6432-63723-0054 IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AND OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
6432-63723-0055 I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED WHAT WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
6432-63723-0056 THAT WAS HERS WENT ON A JEWELER
6432-63723-0057 NOW HARRY KING HAS IT DECLARED COLONEL ASHLEY
6938-70848-0000 EVEN THE SUN CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY TO NOON
6938-70848-0001 THE COLD COLDS AND RHEUMATISM OF THE RAINY MONTHS VANISHED
6938-70848-0002 ASKED A WORKER LAST SATURDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YUNKERS
6938-70848-0003 WHY DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US ONE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARMS IN A SLING
6938-70848-0004 HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM BEHIND THE DEVILS
6938-70848-0005 WHO ARE YOU TO DESTROY THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS LENIN A GERMAN
6938-70848-0006 WHO ARE YOU A COUNTERFOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THE BELOVED ATAM
6938-70848-0007 YOU CALL YOURSELVES THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU ARE NOT THE PEOPLE IN RUSSIA
6938-70848-0008 THE PEASANTS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANT'S
6938-70848-0009 WE KNOW WHAT THE PEASANTS WILL SAY AREN'T THEY GOING MEN LIKE OURSELVES
6938-70848-0010 THIS MAN HAS SCARCELY WELCOMED THE CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PEASANTS
6938-70848-0011 THIS LAST ARE THE YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
6938-70848-0012 WHEREUPON THE OLD EXECUTED COMMITTEE LEFT THE HOUSE
6938-70848-0013 DOWN WITH HIM AND THEY SHRIEKED
6938-70848-0014 THAT FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI
6938-70848-0015 UPON MY RETURN I VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANY MAN PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
6938-70848-0016 MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STRATUS OF THE EXECUTORS COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
6938-70848-0017 BY DECLINING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO BLOCK THE REE ELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LAST SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER CONGRESS
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRURDIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
6938-70848-0020 THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO BREAK WITH THE WILLS OF THE PEOPLE
6938-70848-0021 FOLLOWED HIM OLENIN LISTENED FOR NOW WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
6938-70848-0022 THE FIRST AGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISTS AND THE LANDOWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CLUMSIE RELATED
6938-70848-0023 THE DUMESS AND ZASSTOOLS WERE DROPPED
6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT MY AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED
6938-70848-0025 HE SPOKE UP TO THE RUM CONVENTION
6938-70848-0026 THE VILLAGES WILL SAVE US TO THE END
6938-70848-0027 BUT THE PRESENT MOMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IT IS SO INVINCIBLE
6938-70848-0028 THE WILL OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED ON THE HALL
6938-70848-0029 AND NEW HUMANITY WILL BE BORN OF THIS WAR
6938-70848-0030 I GREET YOU WITH THE CHRISTENING OF HER NEW RUSSIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM
7018-75788-0000 NOW I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED IN HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
7018-75788-0001 BEHOLD A SHIP WAS MAKING FOR THAT ISLAND THROUGH THE DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
7018-75788-0002 HEARING THUS I WAS SORE TROUBLED REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED FROM THE APE KIND

7018-75788-0004 DO AS THEY DO AND BELIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FURTHER THY RETURN VOYAGE THROUGH THY NATIVE LAND
7018-75788-0005 THEN HE CARRIED ME TO THE BEACH WHERE I FILLED MY BASKET WITH PEBBLES LARGE AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLK ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH BEARING A BAG LIKE MINE FILLED WITH PEBBLES
7018-75788-0006 TO THESE HE COMMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO THEIR CARES AND SAYING THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY GET HIS DAILY BREAD AND YOU WILL EARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
7018-75788-0007 NOW SLEEPING UNDER THESE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES WHEREUPON MY COMPANIONS BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING ALL THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE FOLK
7018-75788-0008 WE WEIGHED ANCHORS AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
7018-75788-0009 WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINTH NIGHT
7018-75788-0010 AND CEASED NOT SAILING TILL WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT GUSSORAH
7018-75788-0011 THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTER AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FOREGATHERING WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STOREHOUSES
7018-75788-0012 AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GREAT PROFITS AND GAIN I HAD MADE
7018-75788-0013 NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING MOHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL CREATURES BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND WISHED HIM A GREAT DAY
7018-75788-0014 HERE I FOUND A GREAT SHIP READY FOR SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD WITH THEM GOODS OF A PRICE SO I EMBARKED MY BALES THEREIN
7018-75788-0015 HAPPILY AMONGST YOU IS ONE RIGHTEOUS WHOSE PRAYERS THE GOD WILL ACCEPT
7018-75788-0016 PRESENTLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE MOUNT AND BROKE UP AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD OF HER WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75788-0017 BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS HEALTH AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE TRAVELLERS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
7018-75788-0018 EACH THAT DIED WE WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTHES AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE TILL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT A LITTLE PROVISION LEFT AND I WHO WAS WONT TO HAVE SO MUCH

7018-75789-0002 LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE ON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS ONE NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
7018-75789-0003 I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN AN UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY TO THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT IN MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0005 WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO THIS ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
7018-75789-0006 BUT I WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE RIVERS
7018-75789-0007 WHEN THEY SAW I UNDERSTOOD THEM NOT AND MADE THEM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM WENT FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER

7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLANDORS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0013 SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED FOR MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND

7018-75789-0017 HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THY CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER
7018-75789-0018 FOR STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND UPON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUARDS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
7018-75789-0019 HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THIS AND AS FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST THY WITNESSED
7018-75789-0020 PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRYMAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD
7018-75789-0021 SUCH AGAIN O MY BROTHERS IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL ME IN MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TO MORROW INSHALLAH
7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIXH
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST NIGHT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGES AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEA MEN
7018-75789-0026 KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE IN ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH IN MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND TO HEAR NEW THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP INTO BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGHDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLIMBED TO THE MASTHEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZED AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IT IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT THEY WHOSO COME HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS THE SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID AND BOTH BE PEACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NOWT MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF THE MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO PLATTERBALT'S GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED WITHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LATTER MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 A HEADLONG PARTY ON THE EVE OF A BYE ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DONING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATH LIKE RUSH
7105-2330-0007 THE FOREMAN DELIVERED YOUR MESSAGE
7105-2330-0008 THE JURY FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE THEATRE HALL
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISHED TO ADD A WRITER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A VI ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF THE NEMESIS ON HAND
7105-2330-0010 AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE COLL A JUNIOR CONSUL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
7105-2330-0011 FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO WONDERFUL TO THINK OF
7105-2330-0012 OUR MAJORITY LAST TIME WAS ONLY EIGHT THOUSAND AND SEVEN
7105-2330-0013 SEVEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ALL APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTER PAFF IS OUT BEFORE THE POLL OPENS
7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RED RUPPIES INN TO NIGHT
7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRILOUNNE REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
7105-2330-0017 HE EXCLAIMED WON'T GO ON
7105-2330-0018 HE SAYS HE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM OUT AN HE'S NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW
7105-2330-0019 SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A REALIS PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ESTIMATES
7105-2330-0020 AT ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BAND
7105-2330-0021 THE PAUL OPENS IN FIVE MINUTES
7105-2330-0022 IS PLADDER BAFF OUT YET
7105-2330-0023 IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHY TO
7105-2330-0024 THE CHIEF ORGANIZER RANG AFTER
7105-2330-0025 THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MIGHT BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
7105-2330-0026 CAN'T YOU GET A STRIKE PERMIT I ASKED THE ORGANIZER
7105-2330-0027 I'LL TRY SAID THE HOME SECRETARY AND WENT FOR THE TELEPHONE
7105-2330-0028 EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WE'LL HOLD THE OTHER WAY
7105-2330-0029 A TELEGRAM WAS JUST BROUGHT IN
7105-2330-0030 IT WAS FROM THE NATURAL COMEDY ROOMS AT NEMESIS
7105-2330-0031 WITHOUT A BAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BANK
7105-2330-0032 A QUARTER PAST TEN HALF PASTS
7105-2330-0033 HAVE YOU ANY BAND INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY NATURE TO PLAN
7105-2330-0034 DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANIZISER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS THOSE SORT OF THINGS
7105-2330-0035 THE WARGERS HAVE A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THE MEN THEMSELVES
7105-2330-0036 LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZING
7105-2330-0037 THE POPULAR SONG OF THE MOMENT REPLIED THE AGITATORS AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE WE HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT TO THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONERS STRODE FORTH TO FREEDOM
7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF THE SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATED GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0040 THE SEAT WAS LOST AFTER ALL WITH A NARROW MATURITY
7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENSE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTERBUTH FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
7105-2340-0000 WITH THAT NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIM HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON ONE WANTED IN ONE'S HOUSE
7105-2340-0001 WELL THE FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID THE HUSBAND OR IF DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE ESTATE
7105-2340-0002 BESIDES CYNICISMS APART HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIS FAILING
7105-2340-0003 WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY NOT MERELY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICIONS OF SORDID MOTIVES NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THE THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY
7105-2340-0004 WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRED PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTEREFFECTS OF A POLO ACCIDENTS
7105-2340-0005 A WILFRED FICHNCOTE HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONOURS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRED HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK
7105-2340-0006 AND THE REPUTATION WAS AN IMPATIENT ONE
7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOL DAYS ONWARDS HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF CLEPTOMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATIONS
7105-2340-0008 THE SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEONCOD TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THE CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRED SAYING HE IS PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS
7105-2340-0009 SIGNED WILFRED PIGEONFOOT
7105-2340-0010 I BELIEVE HE'S BRINGING US A PRESENT FOR THE SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS
7105-2340-0011 THE CLOCK FLITTED NERVOUSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER
7105-2340-0012 IN THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER A DINNER THEIR NERVOUSNESS AND AWKWARDNESS INCREASED
7105-2340-0013 OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PEPPER SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUESTS HERE THEY ALL ARE
7105-2340-0014 SUCH NICE USEFUL GIFTS AND A FEW DIPLICATES OF COURSE
7105-2340-0015 TO SEVEN CREAM JUGS PUT IN PETER
7105-2340-0016 WE FEELS THAT WE MUST LIVE ON CREAM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
7105-2340-0017 OF COURSE SOME OF THEM CAN BE PRODUCED
7105-2340-0018 I PUT IT DOWN TO THE CLARET JUG SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER OBJECT
7105-2340-0019 VIGILANCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY CROWNED WITH A SENSE OF SECURITY
7105-2340-0020 AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR VISITOR MISTER PETER EXPRESSED HER CONVICTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN SOMETHING
7105-2340-0021 HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT OR I'M HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY ONE OFF
7105-2340-0022 OF THE ONLY THING TO DO
7105-2340-0023 WILFRID WAS LATE IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOMEBODY WAS AMISS
7105-2340-0024 IT IS AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONGST YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU
7105-2340-0025 IT WAS A LITTLE PRESENT FROM MY MOTHER AND MYSELF IN YOUR SILVER WEDDING
7105-2340-0026 I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND YOU SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT VERY AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING YOU ANOTHER
7105-2340-0027 THAT SNATCHER HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THIS MANY YEARS
7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNEST AND PAGE ANDCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPASTS OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
7105-2340-0029 HER HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED BLANKLY AND DESPERATELY AT ONE ANOTHER
7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT THE INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE ARE AT BREAKFAST
7105-2340-0031 SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEEN STRIPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS
7105-2340-0032 THE PIGEON COATS HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETER HAD A PAINFUL INSPIRATION
7105-2340-0033 PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOMS WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
7105-2340-0034 MISSUS PETER TURNED TO HER GUESTS WITH CONFIDENTIAL CALMNESS
7105-2340-0035 PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS I TRANSCENDED THE FAMILY GOOD LORD
7105-2340-0036 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A CLEPTOMANIA LIKE COUSIN SNATCHED
7105-2340-0037 BRAVE LITTLE BOY SAID PETER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT
7902-96591-0000 I'M FROM THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE POST
7902-96591-0001 DON'T CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO STOP
7902-96591-0002 AND AND YOU WILL HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
7902-96591-0003 I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I WAS IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE
7902-96591-0004 THAT MY FATHER SIR VISDON GRAHAM HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE
7902-96591-0005 SHE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YOU SHALL NOT TELL
7902-96591-0006 THEN PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHIE WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARK UTTERLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD A FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD REASTROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 AND ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGHISHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME AT THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I'LL SOON SHOW THEM BUT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP TO NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ROUND
7902-96591-0014 THE PICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HIDDEN TILL MORNING AND THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOWS WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE CHINA
7902-96591-0018 YES IF THE OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0019 NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO THIS
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FROM THE DWELLERS IN THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN ONE PLACES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S FOOT WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE AND THE SHIP WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISONS FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
7902-96592-0000 SURE YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY SAID FATHER QUITE
7902-96592-0001 I'M GOING HOME TO PRACTICE
7902-96592-0002 SHALL I COME TOO FATHER THOUGH
7902-96592-0003 STOP HERE TILL SIR RISDON COMES DOWN AND TELL HIM I'M VERY SORRY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED OUT LAST NIGHT ONLY A BORN FOOL SAW J ANDY'S LOBSTER BOAT COMING INTO THE COVE AND CAME RUNNING TO SAY IT WAS A PARTY FROM THE CUTTER YES FATHER
7902-96592-0004 TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR TONIGHT
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF PARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHIE REYSTROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER DREAMER HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THIS TO ANDREW TEALE THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHY DID ANDY CALL MISTER GURR FATHERS
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLINGS WENT ON
7902-96592-0010 AND I'M HUNGRY TOO AFTER I WAS UP I SUPPOSE
7902-96592-0011 NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF MILK
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR IT ALL AWAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD WRITE AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARD THEM AND JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 WRENS WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE
7902-96592-0016 HULLO HE SAID HOW ARE YOU

7902-96592-0025 ARCHIE STEPPED BACK TO THE DOOR LISTENING BUT THERE WAS NOT SOUND
7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE GOVERNOR AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE CHIMNEY PRESENTED THEMSELVES
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LOWER IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS IF HE REALISED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASCELLING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MOMENTS HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK INTO ITS SHEATH
7902-96592-0032 NO I CAN'T PART WITH THAT HA HA HAD LAUGHED THE BOY JEERINGLY
7902-96592-0033 BUT I'D YES I'LL GIVE YOU A GUINEA IF YOU WILL LET ME OUT

7975-280057-0000 THESE HATREDS WERE SOON TO MAKE TROUBLE WITH ME OF WHICH I HAD NEVER DREAMED
7975-280057-0001 HENRY WASHINGTON YOUNGER MY FATHER REPRESENTS JACKSON COUNTY THREE TIMES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS ALSO A JUDGE OF THE COUNTY COURT
7975-280057-0002 MY MOTHER WHO WAS BESHEBA FRISTAUX OF INDEPENDENCE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF RICHARD FRISTAUX WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON AT NEW ORLEANS JACKSON COUNTY HAVING BEEN SO NAMED AT MY GRANDFATHER FRISIAUX'S INSISTENCE
7975-280057-0003 I DID NOT REMEMBER WHEN I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SHOOT
7975-280057-0004 MY BROTHER JAMES WAS BORN JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE JOHN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE AND ROBERT IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE
7975-280057-0005 MY DEAREST BROTHER RICHARD DIED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY
7975-280057-0006 MY FATHER WAS IN THE EMPLOY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND HAD THE MAIL CONTRACT FOR SIX HUNDRED MILES
7975-280057-0007 HE HAD STARTED BACK TO HARRISONVILLE IN A BUGGY BUT WAS WAYLAID ONE MILE SOUTH OF WESTPORT A SUBURB OF THE KANSAS CITY AND BRUTALLY MURDERED FALLING OUT OF HIS BUGGY INTO THE ROAD WITH THREE MORTAL BULLET WOUNDS

7975-280057-0015 THREE MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SAME PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE IT WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISONVILLE SHE WENT TO WAVERLEY WHERE SHE WAS HOUNDED CONTINUALLY AND
7975-280057-0018 ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT AT A LESSINGTON WEEKLY
7975-280057-0019 ONE OF MY OLD SCHOOL TEACHERS WHOM I HAVE NEVER SEEN SINCE THE SPRING OR THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO IS STEPHEN B ELKINS SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA
7975-280057-0020 WHEN I WAS TAKEN PRISONER I EXPECTED TO BE SHOT WITHOUT SUFFERING
7975-280063-0000 WE TOOK THE OATH OR PERHAPS THREE HUNDRED OF US DOWN ON LUTHER MASON'S FARM A FEW MILES FROM WHERE I NOW WRITE WHERE COLONEL HAYES HAD ENCAMPED AFTER INDEPENDENCE
7975-280063-0001 BOOMYWER AND MYSELF MET COFFEE AND THE REST BELOW ROSE HILL ON GRAND RIVER
7975-280063-0002 ACCORDINGLY I WAS SHORTLY AWAKENED TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO LOANJACK WHERE HE COULD PERSONALLY MAKE KNOWN THE SITUATION TO THE OTHER COLONELS
7975-280063-0003 FOSTER HAD NEARLY ONE THOUSAND CALVER MEN AND TWO PIECES OF RAB'S INDIA IN A BATTERY THAT HAD ALREADY MADE FOR ITSELF A NAME FOR HARD FIGHTING
7975-280063-0004 COME IN COLONEL HAYES EXCLAIMED COLONEL COCKERN
7975-280063-0005 I THINK HE'LL BE RATHER TOW MEAT FOR BREAKFAST I REPLIED HE MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT FOR DINNER
7975-280063-0006 JACKMAN WITH A PARTY OF THIRTY SEASONED MEN CHARGED THE INDIANA GUNS AND CAPTURED THEM BUT MAJOR FOSTER LED A GALLANT CHARGE AGAINST THE INVADER AND RECAPTURED THE PIECES
7975-280063-0007 WE WERE OUT OF AMMUNITION AND WERE HELPLESS HAD THE FIRE BEEN PRESSED
7975-280063-0008 THEY DID MARK MY BOOKS IN ONE OR TWO PLACES HOWEVER
7975-280063-0009 MAJOR FOSTER IN A LETTER TO JUDGE GEORGE M BENNET OF MINNEAPOLIS SAID HE
7975-280063-0010 I WAS TOLD BY SOME OF OUR MEN FROM THE WESTERN BORDER OF THE STATE THAT THEY RECOGNISED THE DARING YOUNG RIDER AS COLD YOUNGER
7975-280063-0011 ABOUT SEVEN THIRTY A M I WAS SHOT DOWN
7975-280063-0012 AND THE WOUNDED OF BOTH FORCES WERE GATHERED UP AND WERE PLACED IN HOUSES
7975-280076-0000 ALTHOUGH EVERY BOOK PURPORTING TO NARRATE THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS HAS TOLD OF THE LIBERTY ROBBERY AND IMPLIED THAT WE HAD A PART IN IT THE YOUNG WERE NOT SUSPECTED AT THAT TIME NOR FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNISED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPARD REDMACKERS AND BUD PENCE WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUANTRELLES
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAID WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BLOODSHED JUDGE MC CLEAN THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT TOTALLY
7975-280076-0003 NO WARRANT WAS ISSUED FROM THE YOUNGERS BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
7975-280076-0004 JUNE THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE OBICCOCK BROTHERS BANK AT CROYED AND IOWA WAS ROBBED OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BY SEVEN MEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
7975-280076-0005 IT WAS CHARGED THAT ARTHUR MAC COY OR A C MC COY AND MYSELF HAD BEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE GAD'S HILL FARE AND THE TWO STAGE ROBBERIES
7975-280076-0006 THE PARTS OF THIS LADDER NOW RELEVANT ARE AS FOLLOWS
7975-280076-0007 YOU MAY USE THIS LETTER IN OUR OWN WAY
7975-280076-0008 I WILL GIVE YOU THIS OUTLINE AND SKETCH OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND ACTIONS AT THE TIME OF CERTAIN ROBBERIES BY WHICH I AM CHARGED
7975-280076-0009 AT THE TIME OF THE GALLETON BANK ROBBERING I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM PLEELS TAILOR AND RECTOR
7975-280076-0010 THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SHERIFF BARKELEY AND FIFTY OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
7975-280076-0011 I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS SAID FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY TILL FEBRUARY
7975-280076-0012 I THEN WENT TO ARKANSAS AND RETURNED TO THE SAINT CLAIR COUNTY ABOUT THE FIRST OF MAY
7975-280076-0013 I WENT TO KANSAS WHERE OUR CATTLE WERE IN WOODER COUNTY AT COLONEL RIDGE'S
7975-280076-0014 DURING THE SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS BUT AS THERE WAS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED THAT SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE I WAS
7975-280076-0015 I WENT THROUGH INDEPENDENCE AND FROM THERE TO A C WEBBS
7975-280076-0016 THERE I TOOK DINNER AND THEN WENT TO DOCTOR L W TRYN'S
7975-280076-0017 OUR BUSINESS THERE WAS TO SEE EE WEST HE WAS NOT AT HOME BUT THE FAMILY WILL REMEMBER THAT WE WERE THERE
7975-280076-0018 WE CROSSED ON THE BRIDGE STAYED IN THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING WE RODE UP THROUGH THAT CITY
7975-280076-0019 I MET SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AMONG THEM WAS BOB HUDSPIN
7975-280076-0020 WE WERE NOT ON GOOD TERMS AT THE TIME NOR HAVE WE BEEN FOR THREE YEARS
7975-280076-0021 POOR JOHN HE HAS BEEN HUNTED DOWN AND SHOT LIKE A WILD BEAST AND NEVER WAS A BIRD MORE INNOCENT
7975-280076-0022 DOCTOR L LEWIS HAS HIS PHYSICIAN
7975-280076-0023 THERE WERE FIFTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS THERE WHO WILL TESTIFY IN ANY COURT THAT JOHN OR I WERE THERE
7975-280076-0024 HELVINE FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WERE ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND EITHER OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE ABOVE FOR JOHN AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MISTER SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND WAS IN HIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MISTER AND MISS FICKLE AFTER THE SERVICE
7975-280076-0025 ABOUT THE LAST OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE I ARRIVED ON CARROLL PARRISH LOUISIANA
7975-280076-0026 SHE STAYED THERE UNTIL THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
7975-280076-0027 I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THAT TIME I WAS AT NEOZIO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAY
7975-280076-0028 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY AT ADERR IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY
7975-280084-0000 I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED WE SHOULD NOT SEE ANY ONE
7975-280084-0001 WHEN MILLER AND I REACHED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOODS BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT INTO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
7975-280084-0002 WHEN WE CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BAG DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
7975-280084-0003 J S ALLEN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THAT CORNER SHOUTING
7975-280084-0004 GET YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY'RE BOBBING THE BANK
7975-280084-0005 AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE TWO BOYS AT THE BRIDGE THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
7975-280084-0006 ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT IN THAT BANK
7975-280084-0007 CHADWELL WOODS AND JIM RODE OUT AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
7975-280084-0008 IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO WOODS
7975-280084-0009 MEANTIME THE STREET WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY SHORT
7975-280084-0010 EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOOTING INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7975-280084-0011 DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GOT UP STAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
7975-280084-0012 CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND BOBB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILLER'S MARE
7975-280084-0013 WHAT KEPT YOU SO LONG I ASKED PINTS
7975-280084-0014 AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THE BANK I MAKE THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0015 WHERE'S THE MONEY UNDER THE SAFE BOB ASKED
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL FITZ CHASED EM WITH A BULLET
7975-280084-0017 THE FIRST ONE MISSED HIM BUT THE SECOND WENT THROUGH TO HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
7975-280085-0000 THAT NIGHT IT STARTED TO RAIN AND WE WORE UP OUR HORSES
7975-280085-0001 FRIDAY WE MOVED TOWARDS WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMP BETWEEN ELYSIUM AND GERMAN LAKE
7975-280085-0002 BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARMHOUSE CLOSE TO MANCATHO
7975-280085-0003 THAT DAY A MAN NAMED DUNNING DISCOVERED US AND THEY TOOK HIM PRISONER
7975-280085-0004 FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AS HE AGREED NOT TO
7975-280085-0005 NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POST HASTE INTO THE MANCADO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
7975-280085-0006 THE WHISTLE ON THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED THAT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
7975-280085-0007 HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH A PILLAR ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND ON HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
7975-280085-0008 BUT THEY SOON AFTER GOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM BROKE MY WALKING STICK BY A SHOT
7975-280085-0009 WE WERE IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG SAWED HORSES WHEN THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE INDIANS AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
7975-280085-0010 SIX STEPS TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T OVALT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J SEEVESSON
7975-280085-0011 FORMING IN LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE OF THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ROBBERS WAS DISCOVERED
7975-280085-0012 GO FOR THE HORSES I SAID EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
7975-280085-0013 THERE'S NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHARGE THEN AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN
7975-280085-0014 I CAUGHT UP AS A SIGNAL FOR THE CHARGE AND WE FIRED ONE VOLLEY
7975-280085-0015 ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELLED ON BOB IN SPITE OF THAT HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS A FLAG OF TRUCE
7975-280085-0016 SHERIFF GLISPIN OF WAT DAWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
7975-280085-0017 INCLUDING THOSE I RECEIVED IN AND ON THE WAY FROM NORTHFIELD I HAD ELEVEN WOUNDS
7975-280085-0018 AND SHERIFF KLISPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTECTORATE THAT MINNESOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
8131-117016-0000 CAPTAIN MURDOCK IT
8131-117016-0001 BUT MARS PORT HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO KILL IT OFF
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE PRICE OF MEN
8131-117016-0003 THE STONEWALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS NINE HUNDRED
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DARELX AND FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORIES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF THE MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THERE NONE BOTHERED TO GET SO FAR OUT
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THAT HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0007 CAPTAIN MURDOCK WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND NOT WAS ASKING FOR MORE MEN
8131-117016-0008 THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET HIM FOR HIM
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE REMORSE
8131-117016-0010 I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY HE WOULD ON EARTH
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND IT MEANS EVERY ONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT
8131-117016-0012 THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THIS STONE WALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
8131-117016-0013 HE PICKED OUT FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FIVE WELL COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TONIGHT PICK ANY ROUTE THAT'S OPEN O K MAN LET'S GO
8131-117016-0015 BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCK'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH COPT
8131-117016-0016 AT TWO YEARS GORDON ADMITTED
8131-117016-0017 FOR A SECOND GORDON CURSE'D HIMSELF
8131-117016-0018 HE BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT SECURITY YET
8131-117016-0019 HE HAD TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHOVE BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OR THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE PRESIDENT WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THE FINELY TURNED CLUB AT HIS HANDS
8131-117016-0024 GORDON'S EYES POPPED AT THAT AND
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWS THE SENTIMENT HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVING NOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER FOUR COPS HAD BEEN IN RELUCTANTLY
8131-117016-0027 HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND IN A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEYS
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPPLES STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0029 TO FIND A PHONE AND CAUSE THE WAGON
8131-117016-0030 WE'RE NOT USING WAGONS MURDOCK TOLD EM LINED THEM UP
8131-117016-0031 IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED CAREFULLY AND
8131-117016-0032 MURDOCK INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND HIS TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS BLUE AS GORDON'S FELT
8131-117016-0034 I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER WHO TOLD THE MAN
8131-117016-0035 COLONEL THERE'D KILL ME I DON'T KNOW
8131-117016-0036 MURDOCK TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND TURNED TO THE WRETCHED TWOFTS
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAR I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL FIND YOU
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING AND SHORTLY AFTER THOUGH
8131-117016-0039 MURDOCK SENT ONE OF HER MEN TO PICK UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD
8131-117016-0040 AND THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MAN WHO'D BEEN BEATEN BEFORE
8131-117016-0041 MAKE A STRETCHER AND TAKE HIM WHEREVER HE BELONGS HE ORDERED
8131-117016-0042 BUT THE CAPTAIN STIRRED FINALLY SIGHED
8131-117016-0043 NO THE COPSE THEY'RE GIVING ME WE'RE OUT GORDON
8131-117016-0044 BUT THE STONEWALL GANG IS PACKING WAIN
8131-117016-0045 BUT IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH FOR THEM
8131-117016-0046 BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE GOT A YELLOW TICKETS FROM SECURITY
8131-117016-0047 MURDOCK BLINKED HE DROPPED HIS EYES BELOW
8131-117016-0048 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAIN WILL BE REELE
8131-117016-0049 NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPTS A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER
8131-117016-0050 EVER SEED A MARTIAN ELECTION
8131-117016-0051 NOW YOU'RE A FIRSTER HE CAN'T LOSE
8131-117016-0052 AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND A WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WHAT THE SPYLING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW BUT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0055 COST EM MORE BUT THEY'D BE REASONABLE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE IZZIE IS ALWAYS MODEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE SEES IT
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEAS TO THE STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
8131-117016-0058 THEIR GROUPS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCK WAS TRAINING A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
8131-117016-0059 IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT HE WAS HERE
8131-117016-0060 THIS TO LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D SEEN ON EARTH
8131-117016-0061 BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR BLAIN WAS REELECTED
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHOB BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE A WAY TO THE EXTEMPORISED PRECINCT HOUSE
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANYY HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117017-0002 AND THE LOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HAYLEY'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117017-0003 GORDON HIT THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MARS SPEAKER LET A SHRILL WHISTLE
8131-117017-0004 GUNS SUDDENLY SEEMED TO BE FLOURISHING EVERY

8131-117017-0030 AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COPPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN ISSY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USE THE INFORMATION WITH A BEAT SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT TO THE UPPER BRACKETS HE'LL STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS

8188-269288-0033 LISLIE LEFT THE ROOM BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY GONE A DOZEN PACES DOWN THE CORRIDOR BEFORE SHE MET ANY OPENING
8188-269288-0034 EMILY'S EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT HER CHEEKS WERE NO LONGER PALE AND THERE WAS A BRILLIANT COLOUR IN THEM

8188-269290-0033 BUT MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LISLIE AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONGST THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
8188-269290-0034 MISS LAUDERALLE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHER TUTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE DIFFERENT HALLS ON A RAISED PLATFORM
8188-269290-0035 THEN A ROY CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE WAS ANY COLCHESTER
8188-269290-0036 THE PHYSICAL PART OF YOUR TRAINING AND ALSO THE MENTAL PART ARE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED IN THIS GREATEST HOUSE OF LEARNING SHE CONTINUED BUT THE SPIRITUAL PART IT SEEMS TO ME OUGHT NOW TO BE STRENGTHENED

8188-269290-0044 GOD ANSWERS TO EACH OF YOU WE ARE
8188-269290-0045 THE WORLD SAYS NO I AM NOT BUT GOD SAYS YES THEY ARE
8188-269290-0046 ALL MEN ARE YOUR SLAVES
8188-269290-0047 FOR ALL WHO SINNED ALL WHO SUFFER YOU ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RESPONSIBLE
8188-269290-0048 AFTER THE ADDRESS THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWING
8188-269290-0049 IT WAS ALMOST TEN O'CLOCK WHEN SHE LEFT THE HALL
8188-269290-0050 JUST AS SHE WAS DOING SO MISS FRERE CAME DOWN
8188-269290-0051 ENNY COLCHESTER IS YOUR ROOMFELLOW IS SHE NOT SHE SAID
8188-269290-0052 I SEE BY YOUR FACE MISSUS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DISTRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING ARE YOU GETTING ANYTHING BACK
8188-269290-0053 I AM AFRAID I AM REPLIED LIZZIE DISTRESSED NOW IN HIS TONE
8188-269290-0054 I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS LAUDERDALE EXCEPT THE VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED HERSELF
8188-269290-0055 EXCUSES MAKE NO DIFFERENCE THEN
8188-269290-0056 THE GIRL WHO BREAKS THE RULES HAS NOT TO BE PUNISHED
8188-269290-0057 I MAY TELL HER
8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALL VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHILE THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CHARGE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MONTNARAS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICIALS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE PERSONAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0004 THERE THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER IT
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW A FULL TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME BEFORE MYSELF
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR OWN REFLECTION AWAKE THOSE SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UP A COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVE LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALL FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0007 HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE CONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOUR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE CORNEALTH
8188-274364-0008 MY LORD'S I HAVE NOW TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG VANE FALLING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THIS MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO PIM WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWERS WILL ADMIT
8280-266249-0000 AND MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME FOR THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO GLAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOUR
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD BUT A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0004 THERE ARE SOME NICE LOOKING PEOPLE ON THE BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0005 BESIDES OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RONALD LAUGHING AND
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ANSWERED THAT LITTLE BOOK YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I SUPPOSE
8280-266249-0007 AND WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST AROUND THE AGE OF OUR HERALD I SHOULD JUDGE
8280-266249-0008 I DO YOU SON WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009 HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE BIRD
8280-266249-0010 OH SUPPOSE YOU AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRANK
8280-266249-0011 I I DO INDEED THOUGH PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF THEIR AILMENTS
8280-266249-0012 DOUBTLESS THAT IS THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE AND
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMAN'S CABIN WHERE THERES A LIGHT
8280-266249-0014 HE LEAD THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT AND TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF THE DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER CENTS
8280-266249-0017 IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILIONS
8280-266249-0018 THAT THE STRANGE POLYTECHNICA INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS UPON THE MIND
8280-266249-0019 NOTICE THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY OUR SMOKERS AND CHEWERS
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0021 AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRSTY THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0022 HENCE A RESORT AT CIDER AND BEER
8280-266249-0023 NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT THEIR OWN
8280-266249-0024 FOR YE ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODIES AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GODS
8280-266249-0025 I CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR BODIES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE WHOLLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS THEIR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DAILY
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND YET THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKE BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0030 THEY'VE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0031 THE EYES OF THIS WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION
8280-266249-0032 NO SIR HE DOES NOT HERE
8280-266249-0033 THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY
8280-266249-0034 NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER ROSE UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0035 HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STACKED AND HURRYING TO HIS STATEROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0036 WHAT DOES IT MEAN WITH ONE
8280-266249-0037 A VENTRILOQUIST HAVE BOARD OF COURSE RETURNED ANOTHER LET'S FOLLOW AND SEE THE FUN
8280-266249-0038 I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REMARKED THE PRINCE LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT COME ON
8280-266249-0039 THAT FELLOW NICK WARD IS A NOTED BLACK LEG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT OF CHEATING OF COURSE
8280-266249-0040 WHO ASKED THE MAID I'VE SEEN NOTHING UP HERE THOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THE STEERAGE
8280-266249-0041 THEY HEARD HIM IN A SILENCE WITH A COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8280-266249-0042 A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN A POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0043 LET ME GO YELLED WARD MAKING A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO FREE HIS ARMS
8280-266249-0044 I DINKS NO I DINKS I DID YOU VON MESSIN RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
8280-266249-0045 THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS VISITOR AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0046 MISTER RILBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0047 YET THERE WERE GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSION
8280-266249-0048 BUT THEY KEPT IT UP TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT
8280-266249-0049 THEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN HIS STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE COULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0050 AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STAKS WERE VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0051 THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND BLUE BACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROANS STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND
8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FURS WITH A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
8280-266249-0054 IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED WARD LOOK WHAT'S THERE LOOK YOUR SELF
8280-266249-0055 WHAT CAN IT HAVE BEEN I ASKED EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0056 OH OH NONSENSE WHAT FOOLS WE ARE
8280-266249-0057 IT WAS OUR LAST GAME OF CARDS FOR THAT TRIP
8280-266249-0058 THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY THEY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0059 TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DAILIES WERE VERY STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0060 OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE CAN MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE

8280-266249-0062 ELSIE I ANSWERED PRESSING HER HAND AFFECTIONATELY ARE WE NOT SISTERS IN CHRIST

8280-266249-0065 WE FEEL MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE ARE ONLY THE STEWARDS OF HIS BOUNTY AND BECAUSE HE HAS SAID INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME IT IS THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE AND DELIGHT TO DO NOTHING FOR HIS PEOPLE
8461-258277-0000 WHEN IT WAS THE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTEENTH NIGHT
8461-258277-0001 BUT HE ANSWERED NEEDS MUST THOU HAVE ZANABB UL SAY NOW SUDDENLY THERE CAME A RAP AT THE DOOR AND THE MAID SAID WHO IS AT THE DOOR

8461-258277-0007 THEN HE SET OUT REJOICING TO RETURN TO THE BARRACK OF THE HOLY
8461-258277-0008 SO HE ATE AND FELL DOWN SENSELESS FOR THE SWEET MEATS WERE DRUGGED WITH BANG WHEREUPON THE KAZI BUNDLED HIM INTO THE SACK AND MADE OFF WITH HIM CHARGER AND CHESS AND ALL TO THE BAROCO DE FORTE

8461-258277-0016 HE REPLIED I HAVE FORTY LADS BUT THEY ARE IN CAIRO AND
8461-278226-0000 AND LAURA HAD HER OWN BED PLANS
8461-278226-0001 SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED A SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WEAR THE NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JAVIN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM AS HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-278226-0003 I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES IN THE MODERN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
8461-278226-0004 I REMEMBER ALL THE REUBENS SAYS AT THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING AT PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
8461-278226-0005 SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL A PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH POOR GRAY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AYESHA BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0006 IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN FRANCE IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0007 BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN OF THE GALLERY
8461-278226-0008 PHILIP JOCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHILE HE HIS WIFE MADE THE DISCOVERY
8461-278226-0009 HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE OF PHILIPPE LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY

8461-278226-0012 THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF WITH THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
8461-278226-0013 BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS LITTLE ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARD THE WORKS OF OTHERS
8461-278226-0014 I DON'T THINK YOU WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HORSE
8461-278226-0015 YOU WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOR PHILLIP IF YOU'LL SAY YES
8461-281231-0000 HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THE WOUNDED LEADER THROUGH THE WALLS
8461-281231-0001 IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORKELISTONE
8461-281231-0002 AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH THE FEAR OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS
8461-281231-0003 WHAT ART THOU HE EXCLAIMED TO TERROR
8461-281231-0004 LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH EURICA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
8461-281231-0005 EXCLAIMED THE HUMAN HO

8461-281231-0007 THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID EURICA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO SHOULD EXTINGUISH THEM
8461-281231-0008 MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG A GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
8461-281231-0009 THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY THE BRACY HE THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
8461-281231-0010 THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCED HIS WAY INWARD IN DESPITE OF DE BROCY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
8461-281231-0011 TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE LATTER'S EFFORTS TO STOP THEM
8461-281231-0012 THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL WRUNG WITH TWO FURIOUS BLOWS
8461-281231-0013 AT NIGHT DE BRACY FELL
8461-281231-0014 TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK THY PLEASURE BY ME
8461-281231-0015 YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS TO KNOW
8461-281231-0016 EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER AND PERISH I
8461-281231-0017 THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE VESSEL SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAMBER
8461-281231-0018 RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH EASE THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN INTO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS
8461-281231-0019 BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT OF DE BOEUF
8461-281231-0020 AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE OUREKA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
8461-281231-0021 BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION THEN ROSE THROUGH THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTERS
8461-281231-0022 AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED HER TYRANTY
8461-281231-0023 WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THEIR SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORKELESTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
8461-281231-0024 HE LEFT THE GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF KONIGSBURG AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ADDLESTEIN WAS LAID
8461-281231-0025 DE BRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF INTO THE WOOD
8461-281231-0026 HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT AS AN MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING
8461-281231-0027 SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS TRUE WAR HORSE AND RODE OFF THROUGH THE FOREST
8461-281231-0028 DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTERS
8461-281231-0029 AND WITH THIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SETS OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
8461-281231-0030 THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FROM DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A SLOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
8461-281231-0031 HE APPEALED TO THE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS LIFE
8461-281231-0032 BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LYCAS DE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISIT TO THE PERCEPTORY
8461-281231-0033 HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS THEIR FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
8461-281231-0034 POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDING
8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK ROUND AND TO MARK INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAS BEEN CONDUCTED
8461-281231-0036 SHE GAZED ACCORDINGLY UPON THIS SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
8461-281231-0037 AT HIS FEET WAS LAID A TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
8461-281231-0038 THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOUR PRESENTS OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THEIR SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
