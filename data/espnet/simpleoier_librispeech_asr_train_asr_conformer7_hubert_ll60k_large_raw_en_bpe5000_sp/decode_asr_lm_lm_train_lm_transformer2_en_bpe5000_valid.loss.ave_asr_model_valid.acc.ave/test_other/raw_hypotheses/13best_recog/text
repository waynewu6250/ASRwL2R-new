1688-142285-0000 THAT'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHEWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO CIVIL
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKED THAT COUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP GIRL WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU YOU ARE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME THOUGHTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 HIS FATHER WAS DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THEIR DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE SOURCE OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARD TO HELP THE MOTHER IN THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISS THORNTON IS NOT WONT I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LEFT MILON
1688-142285-0015 WHAT TAINTED ASKED HER FATHER
1688-142285-0016 OH PAPA IN THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF MY MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 WITH THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS AND NEVER SAID THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE ITS WORDS
1688-142285-0021 MARY WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO TAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER OUT CAME
1688-142285-0024 ISABEL I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0025 WHEN I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0026 PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT WITH ALL
1688-142285-0027 I DON'T SET THEM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0028 NOT GOOD NIGHT CHILD
1688-142285-0029 THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALES
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN HER BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING IN CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GOT INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE A SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THE MILTON LIFE UPON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP A WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBING MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE EVENING SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL MISSEY HOW ARE YOU
1688-142285-0038 BETTER THAN NOT BETTER IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
1688-142285-0039 NOT EXACTLY REPLIED MARGARET RISING
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER AND NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED OF MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND O BOOLAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED AROUND TO WALK LONGSIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARDS
1688-142285-0042 BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DARED NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0043 AT FIRST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
1688-142285-0044 MESSY DO YOU WISH TO DIE
1688-142285-0045 BESSY WAS SILENT IN TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED
1688-142285-0046 NOT MUCH WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
1688-142285-0047 BUT WHY WAS IT
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER THERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON
1688-142285-0049 I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT YOU SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
1688-142285-0050 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU THEN
1688-142285-0051 THAT SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAYS
1688-142285-0053 YOU'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GROUFFISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0054 BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTER
1688-142285-0055 CAST BESSY AT LAST
1688-142285-0056 MESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT OF YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0058 I REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT TO YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS
1688-142285-0059 THEN I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED TO
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU WILL BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0061 I LEAVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
1688-142285-0062 THAT'S WHAT I LIKE YOUNG WOMAN
1688-142285-0063 I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I KNOW NO NOT BY A BIG DEAL
1688-142285-0064 BUT WHO'S COME AT LAST AND WHO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HE'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT WHO KNOWS ABOUT
1688-142285-0065 IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HEART TO WORK
1688-142285-0066 BUT THE GIRL ON HE PLAYED IT THE MORE WITH MARGARET
1688-142285-0067 DON'T THINK HARDLY ON THEM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
1688-142285-0068 I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOPPED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF EITHER IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0069 THE FEVERISH COLOR CAME INTO HER CHEEKS AND THE FEVERISH FLASH INTO HER EYE
1688-142285-0070 BUT YOU WILL BE HER FATHER YOU SHALL OH MY HEART
1688-142285-0071 SHE PUT HIS HAND TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALE
1688-142285-0072 MARY HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
1688-142285-0073 FINALLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL AND JUST SAY IT
1688-142285-0075 I'LL COME TO MORROW SAYS MARGARET
1688-142285-0076 MARGARET WENT AWAY SO SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
1688-142285-0077 SHE WAS LATE FOR TEA AT HOUSE
1688-142285-0078 HAVE YE MET WITH A SERVANT DEAR

1688-142285-0087 MISTER THORNTON THE ONLY MOTHER SHE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HALE QUIETLY
1688-142285-0088 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ANSWERED
1688-142285-0089 PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF THE PLACE
1688-142285-0090 SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE FAMILY
1688-142285-0091 MY DEARS SAID MISTER HALE ALARMED PRAY DON'T GO OFF ON THAT IDEA
1688-142285-0092 I WAS SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1688-142285-0093 TAKE NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT

2033-164915-0000 AND AFTER THESE
2033-164915-0001 THEN SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HE GATHERED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN FELL DOWN INTO A FAINTING FIT
2033-164915-0002 WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW ITS CASE HE WONDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEWHAT TO COVER THEM WAITED TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
2033-164915-0003 AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND UZDAT AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LEFT HER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THESE VERSES
2033-164915-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANTS HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM BUT HOW HE HAD GOT FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BUYING HOW HE HAD MADE THEIR MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD GONE IN TO HER AND HOW THE KING THEIR SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARRKAN
2033-164915-0005 BUT NOW LOOK TO THY MASTER AND BRING HIM QUICKLY TO ME
2033-164915-0006 THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED A CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO ACCORDING SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE STOCKER TILL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRDING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
2033-164915-0007 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE STALKER GIRDED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESCAKE HIMSELF SAYING O WOULD I KNEW WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM

2033-164915-0015 AND HE BADE HIM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO KING OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND THE TRIBUTE OF SYRIA
2033-164915-0016 SO IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARRKAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHER'S REALM
2033-164915-0017 AND AMONGST THEM WERE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE CADET ZAU AL MAKAN FOR QUOTH THEY HIS NAME BE LIGHT OF THE PLACE AND HE HATH A SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HIGHES THE DELIGHT OF THE TIME BUT THEY SET OUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOR ALHIJAZ AND NONE WOTTETH WHAT IS BECOME OF THEM
2033-164916-0000 SO HE TURNED TO THE WAZIR DUNDAL AND SAID TO HIM VERILY YOUR TALE IS A WONDER OF WONDERS
2033-164916-0001 KNOW O CHIEF WAZIR THAT HERE WHERE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED ME ALLAH HATH GIVEN YOU REST FROM FATIGUE AND BRINGETH YOU YOUR DESIRE AFTER THE EASIEST OF FASHIONS FOR THAT HIS ALMIGHTY WILL RESTORETH TO YOU ZALMA KHAN AND HIS SISTER NUZHAD AL ZAMAN WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN
2033-164916-0002 WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAYNE TELL ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFELL THEM AND THE COURSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
2033-164916-0003 ZAUMAI KHAN BOWED HIS HEAD A WHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THE POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELLED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM ON THE RIGHT WAY
2033-164916-0004 THEN HE ADDED OH MY UNCLE HOW SHALL I DO WITH MY BROTHER SHAKAN
2033-164916-0005 AFTER A WHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE POOLTIDE SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
2033-164916-0006 WHEN IT WAS THE TWENTY EIGHTH NIGHT
2033-164916-0007 AND IN IT ALL REJOICED IN THE ACCESSION OF THE LIGHT OF THE PLACE
2033-164916-0008 LASTLY THE MINISTER WENT IN AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE ZUR AL MAKAN WHO ROSE TO MEET HIM SAYING WELCOME O WAZIR AND SIRE'S SONSPIER
2033-164916-0009 MOREOVER THE SULTAN COMMANDED HIS WAZIR DANDAL CALL A TEN DAYS HALT OF THE ARMY THAT HE MIGHT BE PRIVATE WITH HIM AND LEARN FROM HIM HOW AND WHEREFORE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN SLAIN

2414-128291-0000 WHAT HATH HATH HAPPENED UNTO ME
2414-128291-0001 HE ASKED HIMSELF SOMETHING WARM AND LIVING QUICKENETH ME IT MUST BE IN THY NEIGHBOURHOOD
2414-128291-0002 WHEN HOWEVER ZATHUSTRA WAS QUITE NIGH UNTO THEM THEN DID HE HEAR PLAINLY THAT A HUMAN VOICE SPAKE IN THE MIDST OF THE CAIRE AND APPARENTLY ALL OF THEM HAD TURNED THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THE SPEAKER

2414-128291-0019 THEY ALSO ABSTAIN FROM ALL HEAVY THOUGHTS WHICH INFLADE THE HEART
2414-128291-0020 THERE
2414-128291-0021 SAID ZARATHUSTRA THOU SHOULDST ALSO SEE MINE ANIMALS MINE EAGLE AND MY SERPENT THEIRLIKE DO NOT AT PRESENT EXIST ON EARTH
2414-128291-0022 AND TALKING TO MY ANIMALS OF THE HAPPINESS OF ANIMALS
2414-128291-0023 NOW HOWEVER TAKE LEAVE AT ONCE OF THY KIND THAT STRANGE ONE

2414-128292-0005 VERILY MY GLORY HAD GROWN BIG IN THE MOUNTAINS
2414-128292-0006 NOW DO I HEAR SUCH OLD FOOL'S LEGS RATTLING BEHIND ONE ANOTHER

2414-128292-0008 ALSO METHINKETH THAT AFTER ALL IT HATH NO LONGER LESS THAN MINE
2414-128292-0009 FOR WHEN THERE ATUSTRA SCRUTINIZED HIM WITH HIS GLANCE HE WAS FRIGHTENED AS BY A SUDDEN APPARITION SO SLENDER SWARTHY HOLLOW AND WORN OUT DID HIS FOLLOWER APPEAR

2414-128292-0017 SOMETIMES I MEANT TO LIE AND BEHOLD IT
2414-128292-0018 THEN ONLY HAD I HIT THE TRUTH
2414-128292-0019 HOW HATH I STILL INCLINATION
2414-128292-0020 HAVE I STILL A DOG
2414-128292-0021 THE HAVEN TOWARD WHICH MY SAIL IS SET
2414-128292-0022 FOR IT TOO I ASK AND SEEK AND I HAVE SOUGHT BUT I HAVE NOT FOUND IT
2414-128292-0023 O ETERNAL EVERY WHERE OH ETERNAL NOWHERE OH ETERNAL IN VAIN
2414-128292-0024 THOU ART NOT MY SHADOW
2414-128292-0025 OH SAID HE AT LAST SADLY
2414-128292-0026 THY DANGER IS NOT SMALL THOU FREE SPIRIT OF WANDERER
2414-128292-0027 THEY SLEEP QUICKLY THEY ENJOY THEIR NEW SECURITY
2414-128292-0028 BEWARE LEST IN THE END A NARROW SPACE CAPTURE THEE A HARD RIGOROUS DELUSION
2414-128292-0029 AND NOW EVERYTHING THAT IS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTETH THEE
2414-128292-0030 THOU HAST LEFT THY GOAL
2414-128292-0031 THOU POOREST ROVER AND RAMBLER THOU TIRED BUTTERFLY
2414-128292-0032 WILT THOU HAVE A REST AN A HOME THIS EVENING
2414-159411-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAHMIN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT OUT BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM
2414-159411-0001 THE BRAMIN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THIS CAGE YOU WILL EAT ME
2414-159411-0002 O FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER INTRUTH THAT I WILL NOT
2414-159411-0003 I WILL NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND RUN
2414-159411-0004 THEN THE BRAHMIN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO THAN THE TIGER JUMPING UP SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARDS
2414-159411-0005 SO THE BRAHMIN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE ABANDONED TREE AND THE BRAHMIN SAID TO IT BANNANT TREE BANNON TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0006 ON WHAT MUST I GO JUDGMENT ASKED THE BANDANT TREE
2414-159411-0007 THIS TIGER SAID THE BRAMIN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF HIS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LEFT HIM HE WISHES TO EAT ME
2414-159411-0008 IT IS JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NOW
2414-159411-0009 LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN BUT MEN ARE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE
2414-159411-0010 SIR CAMEL SIR CAMEL CRIED THE BRAMIN HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0011 AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND THE BULLOCK LYING BY THE ROAD SIDE
2414-159411-0012 IS IT FAIR THAT HE SHALL DO SO OR NOT
2414-159411-0013 LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR ME HAVE NO PITY
2414-159411-0014 THREE OUT OF THE SIX AND GIVEN JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMIN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINED TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
2414-159411-0015 ON WHICH MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE EAGLE
2414-159411-0016 THE BRAHMIN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONE
2414-159411-0017 THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID JUDGMENT OF ALL WAS AGAINST YOU O BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0018 AFTER THIS WE SAW AN ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMIN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE VERDICT
2414-159411-0019 BUT THE ALLIGATORS SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT O THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KILL ME
2414-159411-0020 THE BRAHMEN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINION OF THE SIXTH JUDGE
2414-159411-0021 THAT THE SIXTH WAS A JACKAL
2414-159411-0022 THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKO UNCLE JACKAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGEMENT
2414-159411-0023 SHOW ME THE SPACE
2414-159411-0024 AND THE GUARDS THERE THE YAKAL SAID NOW BRAHMIN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD
2414-159411-0025 EXACTLY THEN WAS IT ASKED THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0026 EXACTLY HERE RETURNED THE BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0027 WHERE WAS THE TIGER NOW
2414-159411-0028 WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE DAGGER JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON HIS SIDE
2414-159411-0029 VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL BUT I CANNOT JUDGE IT WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY
2414-159411-0030 CUT AND BOLTED SAID THE BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0031 THEN SHUT AND BOLTED SAID A JACKAL
2414-159411-0032 WHEN THE BRAHMIN HAD DONE THIS THE JACKAL SAID OH YOU WICKED UNGRATEFUL TIGER
2414-159411-0033 WHEN A GOOD BRAHMIN OPENED YOUR KITCHEN DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WOULD MAKE
2414-159411-0034 PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEYS FRIEND BRAHMAN
2414-159411-0035 YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY AND MIND THAT
2414-165385-0000 THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUET AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLATTERING PAQUET BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILIZED MONKEY
2414-165385-0001 THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS INTENTIOND TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMIC WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU
2609-156975-0000 THIS MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN
2609-156975-0001 HOWDORNE HOFAST HODOUBT PATS SINCE HIS GENIUS
2609-156975-0002 LET'S HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MATRON MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET IT THERE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
2609-156975-0003 THE EGYPTIAN BOWED OF THE BONDAGE
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHOSE TURBANT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KIERNAPATH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIANS AND SCRIPZONS GIVE OF THAT PERIOD
2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF THE DETAILED REFERENCES TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ALTAMIQUE CARVETTES INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THEIR TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES PROSTRATE TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDO WERE THE CHIEF FACTORS IN ITS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
2609-156975-0008 THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREED REGARDING THE DURATION OF THE SOJOURN IN EGYPT
2609-156975-0009 THE LATER ADDITIONS SENT TO EXTEND THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY PATOM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATOM
2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY IN SCRIPZ AND ULSTER STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHAM THE HOUSE OF RAMESES A CITY WITH THE ROYAL RESIDENCE IN TEMPLES
2609-156975-0012 THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS SERRANY WAS NATURALLY INEVITABLE
2609-156975-0013 WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM IT THE DESPOTIC ROAR OF THE LANDED DAY
2609-156975-0014 THE MAKING OF A LIBERAL PATRIOT
2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES'S BIRTH AND AN EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
2609-156975-0016 WIS MOSES JUST FINDIN RESISTIN THE GYPSY TACT MASTER
2609-156975-0017 IS PENIONING ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
2609-156975-0018 NAT'RY YE WENT TO THE LAND O MIDIAN
2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR STUDENTS AND FUGITIVES
2609-156975-0020 FROM ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND B C
2609-156975-0021 ON THE BORDERS OF THIS WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
2609-156975-0022 THESE SAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KIDHAM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURTS OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0024 THE COURSE OF THE WEARINESS
2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUA
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIESTS OF THE SUBTRIBE OF THE CANTES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0027 NOTE THEIR CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS A LEADER AND THE DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT AWAY WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KINITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAHWAY OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GUIDE WAS TRANSLATED BY THE LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0031 DO THE EARLIEST SEAREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0032 THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN THE LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0033 MOSES IN THE HOME OF THE MIDDIAN PRIESTS WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0034 THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PITIFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
2609-156975-0035 HIS QUEST WAS FOR A JUTS AND STRONG LINE ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENS HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON THAT POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST AND TONIAN PLAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA MINOR SYRIL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVING SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
2609-156975-0038 THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS INTRUSTED TO MOSES'S CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWERS OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTION
2609-157645-0000 EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PRESENT FOR THE ROYAL FOE O TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
2609-157645-0001 THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGUISING QUOD AT SMOAKEN IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
2609-157645-0002 SOMETIMES TOBACCO IS USED IN CHURCHS FOR DISINFECTANT OR DEORIZING PURPOSES
2609-157645-0003 BLACKBURN ART'S BISIP OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER
2609-157645-0004 ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH LININGHAM FOR A CONFIRMATION
2609-157645-0005 ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER TIDNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTRY AT HATTON
2609-157645-0006 PAR WAS SUCH A CONTINUOUS SMOKER THAT ANYONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HADN'T NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARNED THE USE OF A PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENCE
2609-157645-0007 ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITSFIELD HE HANDED MASTER PIPE AND CHARSER THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING EM PATENT
2609-157645-0008 THEM EM SING ANOTHER PSALM SAID THE CURATE

2609-157645-0011 SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AS MANY TOBACCO PIPES WAS TO THE MAN OF OFFICE
2609-157645-0012 DAVID DEANE SAVOR DENY THAT AWE PROVED THIS IRREVERENCE
2609-157645-0013 GOING TO CHURCH SAINT HALE'S IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN A QUAINT ON THE SIGNING SPIRIT
2609-157645-0014 WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND OUT THAT WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THEIR CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
2609-169640-0000 PARROTS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY THE SYPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE C'EST FOUR OF THEM FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE
2609-169640-0001 AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JIST KEPT THE STEERAGE WAY ON THE SHIP
2609-169640-0002 FORTUNATELY THE JOHN WAS NOT ONLY FAT BUT HE MINDED HER HELM AS THE LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS IN UNLIVELY DANCE
2609-169640-0003 I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SIP POSY SPECTS EE IN MODERATE WEATHER
2609-169640-0004 MISTER MARBLE HE I DO B'LIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HINCOOPS BEIN LIKE THE SAILORS AS ONE MIGHT SAY BERY ASLEEP
2609-169640-0005 AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE AS FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN THE BOAT
2609-169640-0006 I SEND OUT SAIL HO AND CLOSE ABOARD
2609-169640-0007 IT WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
2609-169640-0008 ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET TO OUR TWO THAT GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
2609-169640-0009 AS OUR SEATS WERE HALF LYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME A LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT
2609-169640-0010 I SOON SAW BOTH BRONZ AND GLAD ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER
2609-169640-0011 MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS HORSE AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCALS ABACK
2609-169640-0012 A STRANGE STILLNESS SUCCEEDED
2609-169640-0013 THE PRODES DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED US FAST
2609-169640-0014 I HEARD THE RATTLING OF BOARDING PIPES TOO AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
2609-169640-0015 KAKE WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
2609-169640-0016 THE STILLNESS THAT RESTED ON BOTH SIDES WAS LIKE THAT OF DEATH
2609-169640-0017 THE GIANT BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME AROUND LIKE A TOP
2609-169640-0018 THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER WE COULD PASS THEM OR NOT BEFORE THEY HAD GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
2609-169640-0019 THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INSTANT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE AND THE CLOSEST SENTENCE TO HIS ORDERS
2609-169640-0020 NOT A SOUL ON BOARD THE MAN WAS HURT
2609-169640-0021 ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMEN THE FOUR SIXES TWO AT THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERNMOST PROWO WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
2609-169640-0022 THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN LANGUAGE
2609-169640-0023 I DOUBT IF WE'D TOUCH A MAN IN THE NEAREST BOROUGH
2609-169640-0024 IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD OF HER CANVAS'S BINNED FORE LEAVING THE POORER MOSCENOUS IN HER WAKE
3005-163389-0000 THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHIRBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF SEE FOR THE NOISE
3005-163389-0001 SOME SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEAR DOWN THAT FENCE
3005-163389-0002 THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY AND AWFUL
3005-163389-0003 SHIRBURN RUN HIS EYE SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUTGAZE EM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
3005-163389-0004 THIS AVERAGE MAN'S A COWARD
3005-163389-0005 BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE MAN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARK AND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WILL DO
3005-163389-0006 SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH A HUNDRED MASKED SCOUNDRELS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
3005-163389-0007 YE DIDN'T WANT TO COME
3005-163389-0008 BUT A MOB WITHOUT ANY MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT IS BENEATH PERFECTNESS
3005-163389-0009 NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN UP ACROSS HIS LEFT EYE AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS THIS
3005-163389-0010 THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AND THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AND BUCK HARKNESS HE HEALED IT AFTER THEM LOOKIN INTOLERABLE CHEAP
3005-163389-0011 A CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
3005-163389-0012 THEY ARGUED AND TRIED TO KEEP HIM OFF BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE WHOLE SHOW COME TO A STANDSTILL
3005-163389-0013 A ONE OR TWO WOMEN BEGAN TO SCREAM
3005-163389-0014 SO THEN THE RING MASTER HE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSES
3005-163389-0015 IT WARN'T FUNNY TO ME THO I WAS ALL OF A TREMBLE TO SEE HIS DANGER

3005-163390-0000 ANN BUT NEVER MIND THE REST OF HIS OUTFIT IT WAS JUST WILD BUT IT WAS AWFUL FUNNY

3005-163391-0012 TOO BAD TOO BAD HE COULDN'T HAVE LIVED TO SEE HIS BRETHREN POOR SOUL

3005-163391-0018 BLAMED IF HE DIDN'T ENQUIRE ABOUT EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN THAT BLESSED TOWN AND ALL ABOUT THE WILKES AND ABOUT PETER'S BUSINESS WHICH WAS A TANNER AND ABOUT GEORGE'S WHICH WAS A CARPENTER AND ABOUT HARVEY'S WHICH WAS A DISSENTERING MINISTER AND SO ON AND SO ON THEN HE SAYS

3005-163391-0023 SO THEN I WAITED FOR A STEAMBOAT

3005-163399-0002 AYE OUT WITH A YAS'AM FORE I THOUGHT
3005-163399-0003 SO THEN I STARTED FOR THE HOUSE LEADING ME BY THE HAND AND THE CHILDREN TAGGING AFTER
3005-163399-0004 WHEN WE GOT THERE SHE SET ME DOWN IN A SPLIT BOTTOM CHAIR AND SET HERSELF DOWN ON A LITTLE LOW STOOL IN FRONT OF ME HOLDING BOTH OF MY HANDS AND SAID
3005-163399-0005 NOW IT'S LUCKY BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO GET HURT
3005-163399-0006 AND YOU THINK HE DIED AFTERWARDS HE WAS A BAPTIST
3005-163399-0007 PERHAPS IT WAS MORTIFICATION THAT WAS IT

3005-163399-0011 IT WAS KINDER THIN ICE AS I SAYS
3005-163399-0012 I HAD MY MIND ON THE CHILDREN ALL THIS TIME I WANTED TO GET THEM OUT TO ONE SIDE AND PUMP THEM A LITTLE AND FIND OUT WHO I WAS
3005-163399-0013 PRETTY SOON SHE MADE THE COLD CHILLY STREAK ALL DOWN MY BACK BECAUSE SHE SAYS
3005-163399-0014 I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEAD I'D GOT TO THROW OUT MY HAND
3005-163399-0015 SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I GOT TO REK THE TRUTH
3005-163399-0016 I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND HER BED AND SAYS HERE HE COMES
3005-163399-0017 MY CHILDREN DON'T YOU SAY A WORD
3005-163399-0018 I SUPPOSE I WAS IN A FIX NOW
3005-163399-0019 MISSUS PHELPS SHE JUMPS HIM AND SAYS
3005-163399-0020 HAS HE COME NOT SAYS HER HUSBAND
3005-163399-0021 I CAN'T IMAGINE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MAKES ME DREADFUL UNHAPPY
3005-163399-0022 UNEASY SHE SAYS I'S READY TO GO DISTRACTED
3005-163399-0023 HE MUST HA COME AN YOU'D MISSED HIM ALONG DE ROAD
3005-163399-0024 YOU DON'T DISTRESS ME ANY MORE'N I'M ALREADY DISTRESSED
3005-163399-0025 WHY SILAS LOOK YONDER DOWN THE ROAD AIN'T THAT SOMEBODY COMING
3005-163399-0026 THE OLD GENTLEMAN STIRRED AND SAYS
3005-163399-0027 I HAIN'T NO IDEA WHO IS THIS
3005-163399-0028 IF TOM SAWYER
3005-163399-0029 BING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR THE STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
3005-163399-0030 THIS I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES DOWN ON THAT BOAT
3080-5032-0000 BUT I AM HUGELY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE BEEN MY LADY
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN MUCH THE WORST OF HER
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN COULD BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUMOUR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
3080-5032-0003 WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND OUR GARLAND
3080-5032-0004 WELL THE BEST ONE IT IS THAT I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS THIS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGEST
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITHAL AND ALL THAT KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT TO AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
3080-5032-0008 TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS A SQUIRE OF DANE'S AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANY BODY MAY PRETEND TO SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0010 I THINK MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER COMES DOWN WITH HIM
3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUT THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AS I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMED THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAVE HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR MOTHER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0014 BUT BESIDES I CAN BRING YOU OTHERS
3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY WERE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0016 YOU WILL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAT HE WAS
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY SCAPE
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMORS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBORS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT BUT I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU I SHOULD HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHAT SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED
3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH DEBATE BUT MUCH MORE CALMLY
3080-5032-0024 AND BESIDES THERE WAS THE TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARNED IT SINCE
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW JOHN CHEEK MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETERS
3080-5032-0026 SO KINDLY DO I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHERS IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
3080-5040-0000 THAT IT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BULLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WOULD NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMASH
3080-5040-0003 I WONDER WHERE SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE ME BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING AND BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENJOY IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTERS TO ME OR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
3080-5040-0008 MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGONE THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TO HEED
3080-5040-0009 AND YOU SEE I GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING
3080-5040-0010 BY THE NEXT I SHALL BE GONE INTO KENT AND MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKE OUR INTERCOURSE VERY MUCH

3080-5040-0012 I TOLD YOU IN MY LAST THAT MY SUFFOLK JOURNEY WAS LAID ASIDE AND THAT AND KENT HASTENED
3080-5040-0013 IF I DROWN BY THE WAY THIS WILL BE MY LAST LETTER AND LIKE A WILL I BEQUEATH ALL MY KINDNESS TO YOU IN IT WITH A CHARGE NEVER TO BESTOW IT ALL UPON ANOTHER MISTRESS LET MY GHOST RISE AGAIN AND HAUNT YOU
3080-5040-0014 INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS COMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUDGE FOR A MOST EXCELLENT SERVANT AND FAITHFUL IF POSSIBLE
3080-5040-0015 BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT FIND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
3080-5040-0016 I WILL NOT FIND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVED ME
3080-5040-0017 BUT I WAS CALLED UPON
3080-5040-0018 DIRECTED FOR YOUR MOTHER
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHID WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITHOUT AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS THAN THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING THEM
3080-5040-0021 YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE FOR THIS THAT I ESCAPED DROWNING
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WROTE BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0023 HOW WELCOME WE WILL BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR FACES A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LOVED TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL THE NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS WHEN WE HAVE TIME
3080-5040-0027 WHILE IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT AGAIN
3080-5040-0028 WILL YOU BE TOO GOOD NATURED
3080-5040-0029 HE HAD ONE SON AND TIS THE FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THUS WITH DISCOURSES OF THE FATHER FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOT FOR ANY OTHER OCCASION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OF HER AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO FIX WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASE CUT WITH NINE PEAS IN IT UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PADDLE TO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
3331-159605-0001 THE MORE PRECAUTIONS THE MORE CREDIT
3331-159605-0002 I'VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MEBBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND SAY YES
3331-159605-0004 WHAT A SPITEY THING I AM
3331-159605-0005 I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME HOW I COULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 LET ME SEE HOW CAN I FORGET
3331-159605-0007 SHE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS WHICH USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOUR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITIONS THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAD BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF ITS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLATTERED HIM MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN COURAGE
3331-159605-0014 PARTY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THAT PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BECKY AND BESS BUT COULD NOT RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FANNY THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DUCHESS BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASSA CHARLIE'S HAND MISS MAMMY AND WALK PRETTY LIKE BILLY AND FLOSSIE SAID THE MATE
3331-159605-0019 AT A STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOL BOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOLGIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY FOR THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0021 HE REALLY COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE RODS ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0023 HE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND STRENGTH AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0025 THANK YOU YOU
3331-159605-0026 HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAYS IN GREAT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE ARTFUL OLD MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS WISHED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
3331-159605-0029 SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BUOYANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVEN WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A LIE LIKE LEVERLY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD MADE HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVOURITE WALK TILL SHE HEARD FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 WORKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL THERE'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS SHE'LL CHEER HIM
3331-159605-0035 SUDDENLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PUDDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT ROBBERS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE THE DEAR HAS NOT HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0038 DON'T YOU THINK IT MEANS TO
3331-159605-0039 TRULY JULIE FANT
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT SHE DID
3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEAN TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
3331-159605-0042 I JUST GAVE HIM A HINT BUT HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THEY THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT SIDDY TATTLER SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHANDRAMAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HARD THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0046 I' AM ODD YOU KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED ALL THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WHITEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERYBODY WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCES OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND FOR THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL ITS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THEIR LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL OF THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKED TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NO I AM ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THAT DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0008 THANK GOD FOR THAT
3331-159609-0009 CRIED FANNY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0010 POOR PRISCILLA WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELL TO FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY ONE LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO DRESS BEFORE
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER AND ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATED THEIR RESPECTIVE VERS WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID FANNY TURNING HELPFUL ALL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRIES AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO RIGHT THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINTER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THEIR GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SIDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNES MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OF A BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORE
3331-159609-0022 BILLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT ME IN UTTER DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 HELEN CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORKBASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE STRANGE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
3528-168656-0000 THEY HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN THESE NAMES ON ANY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR OF SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOLGIRL WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THE SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF FONTREVAL DID NOT PERMIT THIS
3528-168656-0006 SHE WOULD NOT SHOW THIS SUBJECT TO ANYONE
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF LAMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENT
3528-168656-0008 THIS UNIQUE CHAPLET SOME AUTHENTIC RELIC
3528-168656-0009 THEY LOST THEMSELVES IN ADVENTURES
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE EASILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT THE DANCER IS LAUGHING WITH HER SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0012 GENERAL LOVE CONQUERED BY THE COLIC
3528-168669-0000 THE PRIORESS HAD RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HER CHAIR
3528-168669-0001 WE WILL SEND A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0002 FATHER FABENT
3528-168669-0003 REVEREND MOTHER DO YOU KNOW THE CHAPELS
3528-168669-0004 AND YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHORE IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
3528-168669-0005 THERE'S A STONE TO BE RAISED HEAVY
3528-168669-0006 THE SLAP OF THAT PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0007 THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT HERE
3528-168669-0008 THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR IT
3528-168669-0009 A WOMAN IS NEVER A
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DAM BABYLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLINUS HORSES ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERLINUS HORSES NEITHER DO I
3528-168669-0011 MERIT CONSISTS OF WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCKYARD
3528-168669-0012 AND A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE WRONG ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0013 IT CAN YOU GET A LEVER
3528-168669-0014 THERE IS A RING IN STONE
3528-168669-0015 I WILL PUT THIS LEVER THROUGH IT
3528-168669-0016 THAT IS GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I SHALL OPEN THE VAULT
3528-168669-0017 WILL THAT BE ALL GOOD
3528-168669-0018 GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS VERY REVEREND MISTER
3528-168669-0019 FAUENT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
3528-168669-0020 I CAME HERE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WISH
3528-168669-0021 AND TO HOLD YOUR PEACE ABOUT EVERYTHING YES REPLIED MOTHER
3528-168669-0022 WHEN THE VAULT IS OPEN I WILL OPEN IT AGAIN
3528-168669-0023 BUT BEFORE THAT WHAT REVERENT MOTHER

3528-168669-0027 NOTHING CAN BE SEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN REALLY
3528-168669-0028 AND THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN THIS DIRECTION THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0029 IT WAS WELL CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN WOMAN CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER AH
3528-168669-0031 THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HIM TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW
3528-168669-0032 A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE THE MAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0033 HAY MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0034 WHAT DO YOU THINK
3528-168669-0035 I SAY MORE OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN ONCE
3528-168669-0036 REVEREND MOTHER I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT I SAID MOST OFTEN
3528-168669-0037 BUT I DID NOT SPEAK MORE OFTEN

3528-168669-0044 SHE RETAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS THE VERY LAST MOMENT
3528-168669-0045 SHE GAVE THEM HER LAST COMMANDS
3528-168669-0046 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HER PRESENCE SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0047 THERE WERE SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT DEATH
3528-168669-0048 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORISON THAT SHE WAS FINISHING
3528-168669-0049 FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE I WENT ON
3528-168669-0050 I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABOURING IN OUR LAND WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT
3528-168669-0051 FORTUNATELY THE PRIORESS GREATLY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT

3528-168669-0130 I WILL MADE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT DASHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN PARTICULAR QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHER IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH IT PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL IN SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL IT AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILING WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE MONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN FORTY NINE
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FITTED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPERS OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESSES OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN A STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND PUT EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THAT WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTE ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUESTS
3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY GET IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THAT IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN HUNDRED EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICEE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONERS AND THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF THEIR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THESE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 TO ISIS
3538-142836-0024 AT DESSERTS OR AT SUCH EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE SPATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND GREEN
3538-142836-0026 IT SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE OF THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS ILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME GIRL SAID THE MOTHER
3538-163619-0004 AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO WONDERFUL
3538-163619-0005 THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND THEY SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF A LAND
3538-163619-0007 BUT IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING SAID HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF A PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPS FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THIS COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THAT NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED THE BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY DRIVE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS ASK THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOLDS AND HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE MAID CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THEN I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER DID HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH HER DISTIFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SONS AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HOG
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING ITS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SYDDY LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO AND ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDER LAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM GOING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID SINDER LAD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID LINDER LAD
3538-163622-0014 AND NOW THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD DONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID SINDER LADE
3538-163622-0017 IT LIES LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SINDERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DWARF FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE FRIENDS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYONE
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW ENQUIRED THE FOWL SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FOAL DOST THOU NOT SEE SOMETHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND YOU HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDERAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE EARTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORDS BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER SHE MIGHT BE HEALED
3538-163624-0003 SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF THE NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHANGE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 IT IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE THIEF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARFS WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REGAN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW AND A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECE OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH A DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD OF GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LEAVING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND A BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FAFFNER AND THEN STAFFOR DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FACKNER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO SIGURD PUT THE HEAD OF FAFNER ON A STEAK AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE MUST TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO AND THEN RIDE OVER HINFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THAT VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD HE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY WHEN HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 LYN BRINHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAMES IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUND WERE BATHING BRUNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRON'S SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAYS HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID FOR THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
367-130732-0000 LOBSTERS AND LOBSTERS A
367-130732-0001 THEN IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION I ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMARY OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIANS
367-130732-0004 A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN WHAT WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD WIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER ALE NEUBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DOMONICO

367-130732-0010 GOD OF SHELLFISH
367-130732-0011 ONE HAS TO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO TO PARTAKE OF THE KING AND SHELLFISH THE MAMMOTH PACIFIC CRAB
367-130732-0012 I SAID COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COASTS IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUSLY AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
367-130732-0013 GOBY'S PATH WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBIES BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PRESTIGE DOES NOT DESCEND TO HER
367-130732-0015 GOBE'S CRAB STEW
367-130732-0016 TAKE THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRATCHING OUT ALL THE FAT FROM THE SHELL
367-130732-0017 SOAK THE CRAB MEAT IN THAT SHERRY TWO HOURS BEFORE COOKING

367-130732-0021 LOBSTER AN MINIATURE
367-130732-0022 SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE WHOLEBROW HAS BEEN MAKING A SPECIALITY OF THEM
367-130732-0023 ALL THE BETTER CLASS RESTAURANTS HOWEVER WILL SERVE THEM IF YOU USE THEM
367-130732-0024 THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR EIGHT PEOPLE AND IT IS WELL WORTH TRYING IF YOU ARE GIVING A DANCE OF IMPORTANCE

367-130732-0030 PICK OUT THE CRAWFISH AND STRAIN THE BROTH THROUGH A NAPKIN BY PRESSURE INTO A BASIN IN ORDER TO EXTRACT THE ESSENCE FROM THE VEGETABLES
367-130732-0031 PICK THE SHELLS OFF TWENTY FIVE OF THESE CRAWFISH TAILS TRIM THEM NEATLY AND SET THEM ASIDE UNTIL WANTED
367-130732-0032 RESERVE SOME OF THE SPAWN ALSO HALF OF THE BODY SHELLS WITH WHICH TO MAKE THE CRAWFISH WATER TO FINISH THE SOUP
367-130732-0033 THIS BUTTER IS MADE AS FOLLOWS PLACE THE SHELLS ON A BAKING SHEET IN THE OVEN TO DRY LET THE SHELLS COOL AND THEN POUND THEM IN A MORTAR WITH A LITTLE LOBSTER COAL IN FOUR OUNCES OF FRESH BUTTER THOROUGHLY BRUISING THE WHOLE TOGETHER SO AS TO MAKE A FINE PASTE

367-293981-0011 TO BE BRIEF HE TOOK THE MATERIALS OF WHICH HE MADE A COMPOUND MIXING THEM ALL AND BOILING THEM A GOOD WHILE THAT UNTIL IT SEEMED TO HIM THEY HAD COME TO PERFECTION
367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE PIS SKIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED IT DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY MUCH LESS THAN HIS MASTER
367-293981-0014 IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THIS RETURNED SANCHO WOE BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KINDRED WHY DID YOU LET ME TASTE IT
367-293981-0015 SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THIS KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU BY THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOUR SATISFACTION AND REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRE
367-293981-0016 THEN THIS IS A INN SAID DON QUIXOTE
367-293981-0017 OR A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE SAID THE INNKEEPER
367-293981-0018 THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLINDED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW VENTURE WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS SQUIRE WHO UTTERED THEM
367-293981-0019 HE SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
367-293981-0020 SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THE BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD OUT THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
3764-168670-0000 THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF A ONE EYED AND THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
3764-168670-0001 COSETTE WAS WAKED UP
3764-168670-0002 JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED NEAR THE FIRE
3764-168670-0003 YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT MY LADY'S HOUSE I SHALL COME TO FETCH YOU
3764-168670-0004 EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEV
3764-168670-0005 I HAVE A PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE GOT OUT
3764-168670-0006 THAT'S WHERE THE MYSTERY LIES
3764-168670-0007 IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THE CHILD YOU WILL CARRY HIM OUT
3764-168670-0008 AND SHE'LL HOLD HER TONGUE I ANSWER FOR THAT
3764-168670-0009 THE FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN VALJEAN
3764-168670-0010 YOU UNDERSTOOD FATHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE IT
3764-168670-0011 JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND FOUND THAT HE WAS RAVEN
3764-168670-0012 THE FAUCHELEVENT WENT ON
3764-168670-0013 IT IS TO MORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECTS ME
3764-168670-0014 THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR A SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO HIS COMMUNITY
3764-168670-0015 THAT THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THAT VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
3764-168670-0016 THAT THE PRIORESS AND THE VOCAL FATHERS INTENDED TO FULFIL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
3764-168670-0017 THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THAT CELL RAISE THE STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
3764-168670-0018 AND THEN SO THERE WAS ANOTHER THE EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0019 WHAT HAS THAT EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0020 CALLED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
3764-168670-0021 WHAT COFFIN' WHAT ADMINISTRATION
3764-168670-0022 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG OUT AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER HIS CHAIR YOU
3764-168670-0023 YOU KNOW FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IS BAD
3764-168670-0024 AND I ADDED AND FATHER MADELEINE IS BURIED R
3764-168670-0025 YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN FATHER MAKELEINE
3764-168670-0026 THIS OFFERS THE MEANS GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
3764-168670-0027 HOW LONG IS THE CANNON SIX FEET
3764-168670-0028 IT IS THE CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH WHAT CHURCH
3764-168670-0029 THE CHURCH IN THE STREET IS THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
3764-168670-0030 HAVE YOU THE KEYS TO THOSE THREE DOORS
3764-168670-0031 NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THAT DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKERS MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET THE COFFINS
3764-168670-0033 WHO NAILS UP THE OVEN I DO
3764-168670-0034 WHO SPREADS A PAW OVER IT
3764-168670-0035 NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM THAT WAS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
3764-168670-0036 COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THIS ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN EVERY ONE IS ASLEEP
3764-168670-0037 ABOVE THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3764-168670-0038 I SHALL BE HUNGRY I WILL BRING SOMETHING
3764-168670-0039 YOU MAY COME AND NAIL ME UP IN THE COFFIN AT TWO O'CLOCK
3764-168670-0040 FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRUSHED HIS FINGER JOINTS BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
3764-168670-0041 PAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS AND A PLANK
3764-168670-0042 JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS THAN
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CORRECT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
3764-168670-0044 WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A CUR
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY CONTENTS
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK DOWN LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0047 A MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPES DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE
3764-168670-0048 WHO IS HERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO A CAT DO COME IN
3764-168670-0049 THE OVERPRUDANT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
3764-168670-0050 BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER IT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I M SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
3764-168670-0052 AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THAT GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0053 I SHALL ALLOW THAT IS MY BUSINESS
3764-168670-0054 THE HEARSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKER MEN KNOT A ROPE ROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0055 A PRIEST SAYS THE PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WOULD NOT BE SOBER
3764-168670-0057 THAT IS SETTLED FAR FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL GO WELL
3764-168671-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAIN PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TIERS
3764-168671-0001 THIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A GREAT BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
3764-168671-0002 A MORNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN THE SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
3764-168671-0003 BEHIND THEM CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABOURER WHO LIMPED ALONG
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING IN SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY ARE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND A DOME OF THE INVALIDES
3764-168671-0006 DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT THE HOUSES WERE DESERTING IT
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VOUGERA IT HINTED AT POVERTY PAR LA CHAISE IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHE IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNISED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0009 THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN IN THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENSE IN OUR SIGHT
3764-168671-0010 IT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE HIS DUTY
3764-168671-0011 THE NUNS HAD CONCLUDED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
3764-168671-0012 IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY A INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0013 MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MEN BUT KEEP EM FOR YOURSELVES
3764-168671-0014 A PRINCESS IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPAL
3764-168671-0015 FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARS IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0016 JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLITY WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0017 WHAT REMAINED TO BE SEEN WAS A MERE NOTHING
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESCION
3764-168671-0019 THEY DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
3764-168671-0020 THEIR PERMISSION FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF LABOURING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED HIS MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0022 THE MAN WAS REPLIED THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0023 THE GRAVE DIGGER LAUGHED
3764-168671-0024 YOU ALL
3764-168671-0025 FATHER SESTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
3764-168671-0026 FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS BUT A GRAVE DIGGER MIGHT DIE
3764-168671-0027 IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIGGERS TO DIE THEMSELVES
3764-168671-0028 HE HAD HARDLY A STRENGTH TO STAMMER
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER BASTIEN IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LIN NOIR IS HERE'S A JUG OF RED WINE
3764-168671-0031 BUT YO'RE A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
3764-168671-0032 ARE WE NOT COMRADE WE'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
3764-168671-0033 THE MAN SMILED
3764-168671-0034 HE LIMPED MORE OUT OF ANXIETY THAN FOR INFIRMITY
3764-168671-0035 THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON IN FRONT OF HIM
3764-168671-0036 FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED CREVILIER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH THE FINE TALKER HE MUTTERED
3764-168671-0038 BUT SIR FATHER MATHEN IS DEAD
3764-168671-0039 THE MAN REPLIED QUIETLY
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTEBOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MESCHIENNE'S TURN FATHER MESCHIENNE DIED
3764-168671-0041 STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT THIS IS MADE
3764-168671-0042 YOU ARE A PRESENT I AM A PARISIAN
3764-168671-0043 FAUCHELEVENT PART I AM LOST
3764-168671-0044 THERE WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEELS DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUNS CORNER
3764-168671-0045 AND SHE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH A WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE BRITANNIAN TOWN HALL
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL THE PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0049 SO YOU ARE NOT A GREAT DIGGER THEN
3764-168671-0050 RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS I WAS
3764-168671-0051 HERE MY REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY
3764-168671-0052 FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT HE WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053 THE GRAVEDIGGER WENT ON WITH A PECULIAR SMILE
3764-168671-0054 ONE MUST GET
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING WE WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR ANYTHING WHAT
3997-180294-0002 WELL DO IT WITH ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR THE WRETCH
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO
3997-180294-0005 HOW GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ALMOST ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNCILS OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WOULD SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY MAKE IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VEIL
3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HAS BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
3997-180294-0011 THEY LOOK BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0013 THEY KNOW NOT WHAT FRUIT TO GIVE
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABORERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY THE WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0015 WHICH IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVE SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THAT MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAISENCE
3997-180294-0018 AND WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAIETY
3997-180294-0019 THE WOMAN BECOMES THE MAN'S SISTER AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 THAT WHY
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS I HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT THE VAUDELE
3997-180294-0023 COME DURING THE THIRD ENTRATE
3997-180294-0024 THEIR BOXES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY THE STAGE BOXES
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I FOUND THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0027 DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL I LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON HER FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 YOU SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPEATED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0030 WAR AT HOME
3997-180294-0031 YOU STILL LIKE ME CAN YOU ASK
3997-180294-0032 BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING
3997-180294-0033 NONE THE LESS I WAS VERY HAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0000 I HAVE NEVER COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
3997-180297-0001 YOU ARE IN THE WAY MARGUERITE AND HOW
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MEN ARRIVE
3997-180297-0003 DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKS AT ME ATTENTIVELY
3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR PRUDENCE I SAID YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP BUT AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM LOST AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
3997-180297-0007 IS THAT REALLY ONLY REASON
3997-180297-0008 IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU THAT WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
3997-180297-0009 HONESTLY CAN YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
3997-180297-0010 I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU COULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0011 NOW GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
3997-180297-0012 I SAID AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING BETTER
3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRE INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING THEIR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 WE NO LONGER BELONG IN OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017 WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEM THE LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER DO THEY GIVE YOUR ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX IN THE THEATRE
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OF OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0021 I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THAT LIFE WHICH HE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVED IN YOU WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK IN THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0024 MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO KNOW IT WOULD KILL ME
3997-180297-0025 MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF SWEETNESS SAID
3997-180297-0026 HERE IT WAS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK
3997-180297-0027 I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HANDS THAT GAVE IT ME
3997-180297-0028 LOOK HERE PRUDENCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS ASKED MARGUERITE
3997-180297-0029 HE WANTS YOU TO FORGIVE HER
3997-180297-0030 ONE HAS TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT NOW
3997-180297-0031 I EMBRACED MARGUERITE THOUGH SHE WAS ALMOST STIFLED
3997-182399-0000 SO MISTER BUZZARD GRINNED
3997-182399-0001 THIS SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER
3997-182399-0002 HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK HATED COUSIN OF OLD MISTER BUZZARD VERY CURIOUS INDEED
3997-182399-0003 ANYWAY HE MUST FIND OUT

4198-12281-0005 LORD GOD DA ME HE POTEM
4198-12281-0006 LET HIM BE CARRIED TO PRISON FOR TROUBLING THE DIVINE MERCY
4198-12281-0007 WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN ADVENT IN ALL THE WINTER
4198-12281-0008 HARK YOU MY MASTERS YOU THAT LOVE THE WINE COPSE'S BODY FOLLOW ME FOR SAINT ANTHONY BURN ME AS FREELY AS A FAGGOT THEY GET LEAVE TO TASTE ONE DROP OF THE LIQUEUR THAT WILL NOT NOW COME AND FIGHT FOR RELIEF OF THE VINE
4198-12281-0009 TO OTHERS AGAIN HE UNJOINTED THE SPINDELLS OR KNUCKLES OF THE NECK DISFIGURED THEIR CHAPS GHASHED THEIR FACES MADE THEIR CHEEKS HANG FLAPPING ON THEIR CHIN AND SO SWINGED AND BELAMMED THEM THAT THEY FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM LIKE HAY BEFORE A MOOR
4198-12281-0010 TO SOME WITH THE SMART SOUS ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDDRIFTS WAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOME PUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
4198-12281-0011 BESIDES THAT IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER ONE SAW
4198-12281-0012 O THE HOLY LADY NITTIS SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTUS O OUR LADY OF SUCCOURS SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP
4198-12281-0013 SOME DIED WITHOUT SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE WITHOUT DYING SOME DIED IN SUFFERING OTHERS SPOKE IN DYING
4198-12281-0014 CAN YOU KNOW WITH WHAT INSTRUMENTS THEY DID IT
4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEANTIME FRIAR JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT INTO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVORED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHEN BY THE ADHERENCE OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 AT THAT BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SHAUDURAS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
4198-61336-0003 TIGLATH PELISER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE EURATIAN ARMY IN KOMAK
4198-61336-0004 A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF ITS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE KINGS
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING TRODORUS WHO LEAPED FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THAT BLOW DEALT AGAINST URTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0007 THE SIFTI MATTI ILIU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT CHAWDORUS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TIGLATH BELIZER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERN NORTH WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0010 ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATTILLIU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE HERO CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA
4198-61336-0012 ITS FAULT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 JEHOAASH THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARD HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHELM
4198-61336-0015 THIS USURPER HELD SWAY AT SUMERIA ONLY A MONTH
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MEHEIM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0017 TEGLATH PALLIZER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTH EAST
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOW PUT TO THE SWARD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS URASTU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLATH BILIZER RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0021 MANOHEIM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PEGAHIAH
4198-61336-0022 JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS ON ISRAEL TO ASSERT ITS INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0023 HE COMMENDED ISRAEL FOR ITS IDOLATRIES AND CRIED
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YE ME AND YE SHALL LIVE HAVE YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS ON HOUSE OF ISRAEL
4198-61336-0025 THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES CAN PERISH
4198-61336-0026 ITRAEL WAS ALSO DEALT WITH
4198-61336-0027 WE SWEPT THROUGH ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0028 THE PHILISTINES AND THE ARABIANS IN THE DESERT WERE ALSO SUBDUED
4198-61336-0029 AND INVADED BABYLONIA
4198-61336-0030 UKINZER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITOL CAPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0000 AND I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST COME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE IN SOME ERROR
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY RETURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME THE LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BENNELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE COMMANDS FOR IF HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0005 I ASK NO OTHER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS CHARACTER TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0008 I BEGGED HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM HE HAD EVER TAKEN IN
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GIORGIO DE CARTONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0010 GEORGIO CAME FOR THEM HIS HELP
4294-14317-0011 I HOPE TO MOVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUC ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LANDIS WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THAT TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGELLO
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SUPPRESS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTOR'S CRAFT
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PIECE I MADE HIM BRING IT BACK
4294-14317-0016 AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE TRUE SCULPTOR
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF THIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS ELEGANT RESOLVE IN HEART I REACHED MY HOME
4294-32859-0000 WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY AND
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE BUT HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDOLIN AND RETCH'S PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH HIS PLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT MODEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SUN WAS LITTLE IN LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O LOYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU OF SWORD HE QUOTH
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAID'S SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAPS WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHEL REED HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO THINK HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST REND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREED
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD EVIDENTLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY YOU MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVES US FROM THE OGRE'S MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS THICK AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DESOLATE SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS TROUBLE
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT IN THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEY HOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FIGHTING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTER AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CRAWLING THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THIS FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR HUSBAND
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL TO ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECOME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR EVEN FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRITH'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 AND ETHELRIED HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE THISOULT
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUITS ONLY ARRIVE LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECTED ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND FLIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REFUSED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THEIR HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO WATCH TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH WOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL OF THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS STEPS OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 HE SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK TO ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRACH
4294-9934-0013 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER GOLD HAIR IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND YOUR BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 THE WILL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THIS
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU KNOW GENERAL NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT IN
4294-9934-0021 THEY PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S
4294-9934-0022 HE GOT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HALLO I'D FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THIS SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARCUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A SONG VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIXTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL NOTE IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRIENDS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MASTER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER SHE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY
4350-10919-0003 WILL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION OH DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU BELIEVE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY SETTLED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 THAT THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN THE PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
4350-10919-0009 WELL THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKY BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED AH THAT IS
4350-10919-0012 OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT ON TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE KINDLY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED AS A MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH FOR LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0015 THE VALLEY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING AT REMINISCENCES
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHED IT HE ADDED
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 THE TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT IS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DELAYS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE WOMAN ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE CAPTAIN CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 I ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DAUGHTER BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE THING
4350-10919-0027 THEIR CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I'VE FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 THEN THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 OF THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS PHYSICIAN WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD COME
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND FANNY PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRIED TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-9170-0001 THIS IS ACTUALLY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS THE INTEREST OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE AND THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN PLEASURES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS EVIDENTLY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THEIR ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALREADY BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THE POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED HE COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING KINGS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXERCISE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THAT STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY A NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF A LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS MUCH MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THEIR AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND BETTER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT FILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES PRODUCED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 BUT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF OUR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FORTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TODAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THEIR RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY OTHER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE BODY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF THEIR ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO TAKE ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE WAS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THE ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS EXTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS ARE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035 THE INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY A MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATE FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBE THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE OR SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS AN MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT WAS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 THEN FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I AM SATISFIED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT FOR THIS STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCES
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FROM THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THAT STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING
4350-9170-0051 THIS GOVERNMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AIDS IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH THE ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0055 AND IF A DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBOURS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO A MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH HIS STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RISK WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THAT POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAY YOU KNOW SOMETIMES
4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR JACK AND THE SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 NO WHO NEEDS A JOB THAN THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS
4852-28311-0003 U K HE SAID
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELVES
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT INTO EMS STREET
4852-28311-0006 WHILE HE ADMITTED I DID
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED OVER HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 THINK THEY REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF SAVING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT KIT WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BITCHER AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED ON HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE WATER
4852-28311-0013 BUT SHUCKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED UPON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO THE CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARDS THE BACK AT THE BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ONTO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND MANY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR IS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN THEM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE ENTERED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY BODIES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT A COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME WAS STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER RICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0025 WHAT THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOKE HIM FROM ITS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE FISH AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOME ONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY AND UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOWS AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0003 HEAVY SAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0004 MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHTS CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO A HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE FOR THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0007 PETER BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0008 CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HER
4852-28312-0009 YES SIR HE CRIED
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A WOMAN WHO NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0011 HE IS A SCHOOLMATE OF MY OWN
4852-28312-0012 JAKIE HARRIS'S NAME IS BUT HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE VOICE WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOUR ON HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BELOW
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE'S GETTING THE JAW SIR
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE APHIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018 THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY SMALL
4852-28312-0019 THEN ON THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28312-0020 THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS HERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER THERE IS THE FREEWAY
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKE STACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023 OUR WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SOUNDS NO LAMP LIT STREETS
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE FELLOW'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
4852-28312-0027 THE COURTYARD WAS PRECISELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS HALTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0029 THE COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLANGED COURT YARD
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED ON TO THE STABLE
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FOR THESE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28319-0000 THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASILY
4852-28319-0001 HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOOSLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28319-0002 CHRIS HOWEVER THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BALL WITH A GOLD FISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0004 WHAT WOULD ALLY DO FIRST
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY IT IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSE I CHANGE OR CAN'T CHANGE BACK
4852-28319-0007 MISTER WORKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE THEM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0008 THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISSUS RIGGER SAID START AT ONCE
4852-28319-0009 THE SENSES SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK AS HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT LAST BY
4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ON THE RETURN
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE ARE CURVED UP POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0014 THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO GRACE
4852-28319-0015 IF HE WAS TO BE THE MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN FEATURES ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0017 BUT HOW DID ONE EXCHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
4852-28319-0018 CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOORS
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD A MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY HE RESUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON RAINING DOWN INCREASED IN STORM
4852-28319-0021 DUST CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE THEIR TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY
4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS WAS TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME
4852-28319-0023 MISTER WORKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UP STAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKY AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCION FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARDS REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
4852-28319-0025 IT WAS AS IF THE SICKNESS MELTED
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES THE WOODEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND O THE FACE
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE LARGE BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET THE BOUQUET FALL
4852-28330-0000 THEY WENT DOWN THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK AND COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NED CILLY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ALBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKED TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
4852-28330-0004 THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHI
4852-28330-0005 WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE OUT THERE
4852-28330-0006 KIT LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0007 CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPT YET KEEN AND PENETRATING
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINNING WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE SHONE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN A CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I SAY I DO
4852-28330-0012 THE SHIP WAS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY
4852-28330-0013 HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE THEM
4852-28330-0014 WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU FIND
4852-28330-0015 THE SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HAND
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT CRY SIR
4852-28330-0017 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED AT ITS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0018 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW A COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0019 CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME THEY UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0020 WHAT SHOULD BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS OUGHT TO ASK
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS THE CAPTAIN OF SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT
4852-28330-0022 I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CARE FOR YOU
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE LEFT MISTER BOOKER AND CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE FOLLOWED UP AND SATISFACTIONILY ACCOUNTED FOR
4852-28330-0025 THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SO LITTLE WHILE
533-1066-0000 THEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES INTO THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
533-1066-0002 I AM SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISSUS JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
533-1066-0003 FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HULL IN THE LODGE
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOTED PURE MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0005 MISS INNS HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UPSTAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TO NIGHT
533-1066-0006 I HAVE NONE I ANSWERED HAPPILY
533-1066-0007 I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH ANYTHING RATHER UNUSUAL
533-1066-0008 THE MOST UNUSUAL THING WE CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT
533-1066-0009 ANYTHING IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID
533-1066-0010 PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLDER CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
533-1066-0011 LIDDY WAS SLEEPIN THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
533-1066-0012 THEY WERE TALKING COULENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
533-1066-0013 THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER THE WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0014 BUT I ASKED NO QUESTIONS
533-1066-0015 ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STUART WHEN HE RAN THROUGH A WIRE FENCE
533-1066-0016 I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I SPOKE
533-1066-0017 THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHEN WE FINALLY COME TO A HALT
533-1066-0018 I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A FEARFUL SPOT
533-1066-0019 IN SPITE OF MYSELF I THREW MY BREATH IN SHARPLY
533-1066-0020 IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLING SPADES
533-1066-0021 THE MASTER KEPT A KEEN LOOK OUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED
533-1066-0022 THERE'S ONE THING SURE WE'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY
533-1066-0023 A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN IN DIGGING THEM UP
533-1066-0024 I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND GOT DOWN
533-131556-0000 BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE YOU GO
533-131556-0001 FOR NONE COULD ENDURE ME AS HE HAS DONE WELL
533-131556-0002 THE WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS SURE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUPPRESS HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
533-131556-0004 I HAVE DONE WELL TO REWARD THEM SO MINUTELY
533-131556-0005 THEY HAD RETAINED THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK
533-131556-0006 I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ESTEEM THE APPEARANCE OF IT
533-131556-0007 UPON PERUSING THIS SHE RETURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP
533-131556-0008 YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND THEY'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT
533-131556-0009 WILL YE OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE
533-131556-0010 HU YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS
533-131556-0011 IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY BEFORE
533-131556-0012 I ENJOY A MOONLAND RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THE THRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RESORTS
533-131556-0013 SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER CHIN AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
533-131556-0014 I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN WALKING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
533-131556-0015 YES MAMMA
533-131556-0016 CERTAINLY I DO
533-131556-0017 SHE PAUSED IN APPARENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW
533-131556-0018 I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW HORRID TONE
533-131556-0019 IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR ADMEPTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
533-131556-0020 I SHALL NOT SELL HIM
533-131556-0021 GIVE ME NO THANKS IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I RETURN
533-131556-0022 AND MILICENT WILL YOU KNOW HER
533-131556-0023 I COULD NOT FOR MUCH THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF HER RELATION
533-131556-0024 YOU USE ARD WORDS MISSUS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU
533-131556-0025 HOW DARE YOU MENTION THE NAME TO ME
533-131562-0000 IT SEEMS VERY INTERESTING LOVE SAID HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO WHERE I STOOD WRINGING MY HANDS IN SILENT RAGE AND ANGUISH BUT IT'S VERY LONG I'LL LOOK AT IT SOME OTHER TIME AND MEANWHILE I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KISS MY DEAR WHAT KISS
533-131562-0001 THE KEYS OF THE CABINET DESK DRAWER AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
533-131562-0002 THE KEY OF MY VESK IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
533-131562-0003 NOW THEN SNEERED HE HE MUST HAVE A CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY
533-131562-0004 BUT PUTTING THE KEYS INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY
533-131562-0005 THAT AND ALL REPLIED THE MASTER AND THE THINGS ARE CLEARED AWAY
533-131562-0006 MISTER HUNTINGDON NOW WENT UPSTAIRS
533-131562-0007 MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE'S VERY DEVIL FOR SIGHT
533-131562-0008 I DIDN'T SAY I'D BROKEN IT DID I RETORTED HE
533-131562-0009 I SHALL PUT YOU IN A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE FOR YOUR OWN PRIVATE EXPENSES AND YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ANY MORE ABOUT MY CONCERNS I SHALL LOOK OUT FOR A STEWARD MY DEAR I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO TEMPTATION
533-131562-0010 AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GRIEBS MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO UP ON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN
533-131562-0011 WHAT GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE YOU MAKE NOW MISTER HUNTINGDON
533-131562-0012 I TENDED TO DEFRAUD YOU
533-131562-0013 NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS BUT IT'S BETTER TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
533-131562-0014 HERE BENSON ENTERED THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENTLY TRIUMPHED IN MY DESPAIR
533-131562-0015 I KNOW THAT DAY AFTER DAY SUCH FEELING WOULD RETURN UPON ME
533-131562-0016 I TRY TO LOOK INTO HIM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT IT WILL CLEAVE TO THE DUST
533-131564-0000 VAIN HOPE I FELT
533-131564-0001 MISTER AND MISSUS HATTERSLEY HAVE BEEN STAYING AT A GROVE A FORTNIGHT AND AS MISSUS HARGRAVE IS STILL ABSENT AND THE WEATHER WAS REMARKABLY FINE I NEVER PASSED A DAY WITHOUT SEEING MY TWO FRIENDS MILICENT AND ESTHER EITHER THERE OR HERE
533-131564-0002 NOW UNLESS YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT HIM HOME
533-131564-0003 YOU CAN'T YOU DON'T WANT HIM DO YOU
533-131564-0004 IT IS A RESOLUTION USUALLY FORMED LONG AGO
533-131564-0005 WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF A LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS WHEN WE CAN'T RESPECT HIM
533-131564-0006 NO I'D RATHER BE A LIKE MYSELF THAN AS I AM
533-131564-0007 NEVER MIND MY PLAIN SPEAKING SAID I IT IS FOR THE BEST OF MOTIVES
533-131564-0008 BUT TELL ME SHOULD YOU WISH OUR SONS TO BE LIKE MISTER HUNTINGDON OR EVEN LIKE YOURSELF

533-131564-0014 WHAT COULD YOU MAKE OF ME AND THE CHILDREN TO BE SURE THAT WOR A HURT TO DEATH BETWEEN THEM
533-131564-0015 I KNOW THEY ARE BLESS YOU
533-131564-0016 HE FOLLOWED HER INTO THE LIBRARY
533-131564-0017 I SOUGHT OUT AND PUT INTO HIS HANDS TWO OF MILICENT'S LETTERS ONE DATED FROM LONDON AND WRITTEN DURING ONE OF HIS WILDEST SEASONS OF RECKLESS DISSIPATION THE OTHER IN THIS COUNTRY DURING A LUCID INTERVAL
533-131564-0018 THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMSBY AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENUOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON THE OLD MAN'S SHOULDERS
533-131564-0019 I'VE BEEN A CURSED RASCAL GOD KNOWS SAID HE AS HE GAVE IT THE HEARTY SQUEEZE BUT YOU SEE IF I DON'T MAKE AMENDS FOR IT DAMN ME IF I DON'T
533-131564-0020 IF YE INTEND TO REFORM INVOKE GOD'S BLESSING HIS MERCY AND HIS AID NOT HIS CURSE
533-131564-0021 GOD HELP ME THEN FOR I'M SURE I KNOW IT
533-131564-0022 WHERE IS MILICENCE
533-131564-0023 NAY NOT I SAID HE TURNING ROUND AND PUSHING HER TOWARD ME
533-131564-0024 MILICENT GREW TO THANK ME OVERWHELMING WITH GRATITUDE
533-131564-0025 CRIED SHE I COULDN'T HAVE INFLUENCED HIM I AM SURE BY ANYTHING I COULD HAVE SAID
533-131564-0026 YOU EVER TRIED ME MILLY SAID HE
533-131564-0027 AFTER THAT THEY WILL REPAIR TO THEIR HOME
5442-32873-0000 CAPTAIN LAKE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE A LONDON DANDY NOW
5442-32873-0001 THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND A WILD LORE IN HIS YELLOW EYES RACHEL SAT DOWN
5442-32873-0002 A SLAVE ONLY FOR A SLAVE
5442-32873-0003 OH FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL IS THIS A DREAM
5442-32873-0004 OR FRIGHTFUL DREADFUL
5442-32873-0005 STANLEY STANLEY IT WOULD BE MERCY TO KILL ME SHE BROKE FORTH AGAIN
5442-32873-0006 BRIGHT AND GNATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING BULLFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH A BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF A SAGE HER PILLOW SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
5442-32873-0007 WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TORLET BOTTLE OF EAU COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
5442-32873-0008 THERE WAS NOTHING MORE BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE PROCESS
5442-32873-0009 THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND LOOKING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM
5442-32873-0010 AND SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY THROUGH THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS
5442-32873-0011 RACHAEL LEAK RACHEL LAKE WHAT ARE YOU
5442-32873-0012 I'LL STAY HERE THAT WAS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-32873-0013 HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGOTT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0014 LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKINS'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WILDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOLL CART FOR MIKE BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOGCART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
5442-32873-0015 BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LINE WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARDS THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGEN
5442-32873-0016 HERE WERE A FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
5442-32873-0017 LOSE NO TIME OR I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A CRUMB
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STUCK HOME HIS GREASY WIDE AWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOLL CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSES HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME ON TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TAMAR
5442-41168-0000 THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF THE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALL
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COARSE SERGIY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR OTTO A BALLARD
5442-41168-0004 WE SHED OUR BLOOD FOR THE COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE'S A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 VOTES PLEASE BIZ
5442-41168-0007 THEY EXPRESSED THE IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOUT FLERO SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SERDYA IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FERV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A REST IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT A REFRESHMENT BAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAVEWHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED A SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JURED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEA IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0014 SERGIY IVANOVITCH FROWNED
5442-41168-0015 THAT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN DESIGN HE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE REFLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0017 A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION SEVENTY EIGHT AGAINST
5442-41168-0018 SANG IN THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
5442-41168-0019 THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO KNOTS WERE FOUND IN THAT BOX
5442-41168-0020 BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERIVE
5442-41168-0021 IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE APPREHENSION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THAT DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN THEY LET THEM SERVE
5442-41168-0024 AND THE MARSHAL HAD DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
5442-41168-0025 THEY WAS TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTION
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNOTKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT FLYEROV TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMEN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKI AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT IS BEING SAID AROUND HIM
5442-41169-0002 AND HE'S SUCH A BLACKGUARD
5442-41169-0003 I'VE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
5442-41169-0004 THESE GENTLEMEN WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY YOUNG CHAMPAGNE
5442-41169-0006 LAST YEAR TO OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S
5442-41169-0007 OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION AND SO IT MUST BE
5442-41169-0008 WHY WHAT'S THERE TO UNDERSTAND
5442-41169-0009 THERE IS NO MEANING IN THIS AT ALL
5442-41169-0010 THEN TOO ONE MUST KEEP UP CONVENTIONS
5442-41169-0011 THERE'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF A SORT
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO SAY THE TRUTH THERE'S ONE'S OWN INTERESTS
5442-41169-0013 THEY ARE PROPRIETORS OF HIS SOD BUT WE ARE LANDOWNERS
5442-41169-0014 AS IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0015 IF YOU ARE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND HOW IS YOUR LAND
5442-41169-0017 WHEN ONE'S WORK IS THROWN IN FOR NOTHING
5442-41169-0018 OH WELL ONE DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU
5442-41169-0019 AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY WIFE I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND THAT ONE DOES IT
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASSEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THE LIME TREES
5442-41169-0023 HERE YOU ARE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BACH
5442-41169-0024 YOU'RE MARRIED I FEAR SAID THE LANDOWNER
5442-41169-0025 PERHAPS IT'S RATHER STRANGE HE WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THE LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS BLACK MUSTACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR PACKS FOR TIMBER
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT HAS STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO GET ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A RETURN TOO AT A CERTAIN LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLIUS VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HERMONN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANER
5484-24317-0002 SHE MUST APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS EXPEDITION
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET SHE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TRIED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUED DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARRESTED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER LOYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMANN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATIAN IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSINO
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF LIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELL CHILLED AMONGST THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 CRETES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICHO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENO'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSCIMACHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE REPLIED HARMON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES AND TIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISED ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF AN HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMYNTAS THE LIEGE CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLIS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE STOCK PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSNAULT IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING HER WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE CONFUSED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPEATED HERMANN
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENELLA HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
5484-24317-0025 THIS ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HERMEND LISTENED TO THE PAIR IN SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENIUS ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRATEZ HERMANN'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMEANOUR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGERS OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE THE TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAD WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMAND'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS THERE WAS STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN UPON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNAS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS THEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND WHEN YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMANN PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING IN THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LED TO EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLINDMAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET ITS SUDDEN END AS A BOOM FROM THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND FEARFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMANN WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER OR ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTILIS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED THEM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24318-0010 YET IT IS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE BUT THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT HIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILLYPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERRIMANNE IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU IN THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THEIR LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPA SILENCED HER WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMTH RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN DESPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS AT THE PALASTER THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALREADY
5484-24318-0021 DAPHNE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY THAT MORE IS NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMANN WITH STOOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORKER MYRTIS
5484-24318-0024 WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS ME
5484-24318-0025 AND I FOOL BLINDED ALSO IN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEALS AND PALLIATE NOTHING
5484-24318-0027 SORIKAIUS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF WAS ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMINETES THE RHOODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM THE LAST WORD
5484-24318-0031 THE WAY HIS HEART THROPPED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN DAPHNE'S ENEMIES AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS JUST VIEW
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERN
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATELLUS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HERIMON
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING COME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOUR TO MYRTELIS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FEASTEL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMPS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THIS GOD GAVE RAIN THUNDER AND HARVEST
5764-299665-0001 WHETHER SHE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND MYSELF
5764-299665-0002 BECAUSE ANY PRAYER WAS EVER ANSWERED
5764-299665-0003 WHY DO HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUAL INFERIOR
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE FEMALE THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0005 ARE THE TRAVELLERS UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0006 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAS BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH A LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOWED FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0008 IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0009 DID THIS GOD ABOUT THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0010 DID HE ELOW TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0011 CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A PEOPLE BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DIVORRE HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANTED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE FEEDS OF LIFE
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NURSE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF THE MICROBE
5764-299665-0015 FEAR BUILDS THE ALTAR AND OFFERS THIS SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0016 FEAR ERECTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEADS OF MEN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0017 LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEATED THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0018 CAN WE SAY THAT WE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
5764-299665-0019 CAN WE SAY THAT ITS MERCY ENDURETH FOREVER
5764-299665-0020 DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH WATERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0021 WAS HERE GOODNESS WAS THERE WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0022 OUGHT THE SUPERIOR RACE TO THANK GOD THAT THERE ARE NOT THE INFERIOR
5764-299665-0023 MOST PEOPLE CLINK TO THE SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0024 IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE OTHER
5764-299665-0025 THAT IS THIS POWER
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES TOO EXPERIENCE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COMES TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0028 HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND KNOWS THAT IT IS THE WRONG WAY
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPED IT WITH A DIMPLED HAND
5764-299665-0030 THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAD TAUGHT THE CHILDREN A LESSON
5764-299665-0031 IT IS A REASON
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE WAS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0033 WE LIVE TOGETHER IN THE FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS
5764-299665-0034 AND THEY ARE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
5764-299665-0035 THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT WAS TO SAY AS MORAL
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MINISTERS
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAD SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN LOVE
5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THE IMMORTAL CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0039 THE EDUCATION IS CULTIVATED
5764-299665-0040 A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF OTHERS
5764-299665-0041 THEIR SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
5764-299665-0042 IT JUDGES HIMSELF
5764-299665-0043 AND ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0044 MAN HAS CONCEIVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HES CHRISTIANITY DUNGOUND
5764-299665-0046 WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL THERE WERE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY OH AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0048 COULD THE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN WORTH WITHOUT RELIGION
5764-299665-0049 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAVE ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0050 WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DID FOR THEM
5764-299665-0051 THEY HATED SLAVERY
5764-299665-0052 THEN MUFFLED ALL THE BELLS OF GLADNESS
5764-299665-0053 THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED COURAGE
5764-299665-0054 A PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF HER BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSING IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC
5764-299665-0058 HAS THE BISHOP MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HATH BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES HAS FAILED
5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION OR THOUGHT
5764-299665-0061 RELIGION HAS NEVER MAKE MEN FREE
5764-299665-0062 IT IS NEVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
5764-299665-0063 ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARER CONSTANT THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0064 CAN WE CURE THIS DISEASE BY SUPPLICATION
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR HONOR AND ALMS
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WOULD LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT HIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE TURNED THE STONES
5764-299665-0068 THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A BAS
5764-299665-0069 IF WE BUILD IT WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM
5764-299665-0070 I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER ONES
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST SECTION IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNERSTONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND GROWTH ARE FROM END TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN NOR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN IN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0075 AND SAY WHAT I THINK
5764-299665-0076 EVERY EVENT HAS PERHAPS
5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED WAS NOT
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHAINED RIZ AND THE CAMP BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
5764-299665-0079 WE THEN KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0080 WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSAL IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE PART THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELLED
5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN OR WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE THE REFORMERS FAITHFUL
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND ON THE LORD UPON LUCK AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VIRTUES TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0087 FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE WHERE
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PRODUCTED WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
5764-299665-0089 MUST THE WORLD FOR EVER REMAINED THE VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE A BURDEN AND CURSES WHERE
5764-299665-0091 PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAD BEEN DEATH
5764-299665-0092 LAW CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER PERFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
5764-299665-0093 THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY TALK OF EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0094 THIS IS THE SOLUTION TO THE WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0095 THIS FREES CHILDREN
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME YOU WILL BE CHILDLESS
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO SEE THE FAULTS AND BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE
6070-63485-0000 THERE DONE FAST SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOW KEY TO THE CHOUETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE
6070-63485-0001 THE TWO MESSENGERS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSES
6070-63485-0002 BY MEANS OF THIS STRATAGEM THEY FOLLOWED SO CLOSELY THAT ALTHOUGH WITHIN A FEW STEP OF SARAH AND TOM THEY DID NOT HEAR THEM
6070-63485-0003 SARAH AND HER BROTHER HAVING AGAIN PASSED BY THE TUPPY FRANC ARRIVED CLOSE TO THE DILAPIDATED HOUSE WHICH WAS PARTLY IN RUINS AND ITS ORNAMENT CELLARS FORMED A KIND OF GULF ALONG WHICH THE STREET RAN IN THAT DIRECTION
6070-63485-0004 IN AN INSTANT THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH A LEAP RESEMBLING IN STRENGTH AND AGILITY THE SPRING OF A TIGER SEIZED SATAN WITH ONE HAND BY THE THROAT AND EXCLAIMED YOUR MONEY OR I WILL FLING YOU INTO THAT HOLE
6070-63485-0005 NO SAID THE OLD BRUTE GRUMBLINGLY NO NOT ONE RING BUT A SHAME
6070-63485-0006 TOM SEYON DID NOT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND DURING THIS SCENE RAPIDLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AS IT HAD OCCURRED
6070-63485-0007 OCH TO LAY A TRAP TO CATCH US REPLIED THE THIEF
6070-63485-0008 THEN ADDRESSING THOMAS SATYURN YOU KNOW THE PLAIN OF SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0009 DID YOU SEE IN THE CABARET WE HAD JUST LEFT FOR I KNEW YOU AGAIN THE MAN WHOM THE CHARCOAL MAN CAME TO SEEK
6070-63485-0010 CRIED THE SCHOOLMASTER A THOUSAND FRANCS AND ILL KILL HIM
6070-63485-0011 WRETCH I DO NOT SEE THIS LIFE REPLIED SARAH TO THE SCHOOLMASTER

6070-63485-0014 WELL MY WIFE WILL BE THERE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER YOU WILL TELL HER WHAT YOU WANT AND I SHALL SEE
6070-63485-0015 TO THE PLAIN OF SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0016 BETWEEN SAINT OIN AND THE ROAD OF LA RIVOL AT THE END OF THE ROAD AGREED
6070-63485-0017 HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS OF THE SELF STYLED MAN PAINTER
6070-63485-0018 THE FIORCAS STARTED
6070-86744-0000 FRANZ WHO SEEMED ATTRACTED BY SOME INVISIBLE INFLUENCE TOWARDS THE COUNT IN WHICH TERROR WAS STRANGELY MINGLED FELT AN EXTREME RELUCTANCE TO PERMIT HIS FRIEND TO BE EXPOSED ALONE TO THE SINGULAR FASCINATION THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE SEEMED TO EXERCISE OVER HIM AND THEREFORE MADE NO OBJECTION TO ALBERT'S REQUEST BUT AT ONCE ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE DESIRED SPOT AND AFTER A SHORT DELAY THE COUNT JOINED THEM IN THE SALON
6070-86744-0001 MY VERY GOOD FRIEND AN EXCELLENT FELLOW REPLIED THE COUNT WITH A SMILE YOU REALLY EXAGGERATE MY TRIFLING EXERTIONS
6070-86744-0002 MY FATHER THE COMTE DE MORCERF ALTHOUGH OF SPANISH ORIGIN POSSESSES CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE BOTH AT A COURT OF FRANCE AND MADRID AND I UNHESITATINGLY PLACE THE BEST SERVICES OF MYSELF AND ALL TO WHOM MY LIFE IS DEAR AT YOUR DISPOSAL

6070-86744-0009 THAT HAPPENS WHEN DO YOU LEAVE
6070-86744-0010 OF FRANCE NO FOR VENICE I SHALL REMAIN IN ITALY FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO
6070-86744-0011 NOW WE SHALL NOT MEET IN PARIS

6070-86744-0013 WELL SINCE WE MUST PART SAID THE COUNTESS HOLDING OUT A HAND TO EACH OF THE YOUNG MEN ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU BOTH A SAFE AND PLEASANT JOURNEY
6070-86744-0014 WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED HERBERT OF FRANCE WHEN THEY HAD RETURNED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS YOU SEEM MORE THAN COMMONLY THOUGHTFUL
6070-86744-0015 I WILL CONFESS TO YOU ALBERT REPLIED FLORENCE THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0016 DID YOU EVER MEET ME PREVIOUSLY TO COMING HITHER
6070-86744-0017 UPON MY SON THEN LISTEN TO ME
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY ON THIS ALMOST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAM AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YACHT SEEN IN THE DISTANT HORIZON DRIVING UNDER FULL SAIL TOWARDS PORTO VECCHIO
6070-86744-0019 THEN HE RECALLED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86744-0020 BUT SAID FRANZ THE CORSICAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSELS
6070-86744-0021 WHY REALLY THE THINGS SEEMS TO ME SIMPLE ENOUGH
6070-86744-0022 TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DOES HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT WERE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLIER LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINGTURED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY
6070-86744-0023 CERTAINLY THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO BE ANSWERED
6070-86744-0024 MY DEAR FRANTZ REPLIED ALBERT WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO RELIEVE HIM
6070-86744-0025 WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT IS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY IS HE A NATIVE OF
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESS HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SENOR VAMPA WHEN I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASE AND UNCONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ELIZABETH'S SIDE
6070-86744-0028 WELL SAID FRANZ WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT BUT YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND MY POWERS OF REFUTATION
6070-86744-0029 AND NOW MY DEAR FRANZ LET US TALK OF NOTHING ELSE
6070-86745-0000 NOW SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND COURT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THEY WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0002 AT A QUARTER TO TEN A VALET ENTERED HE MOVED WITH A LITTLE GROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASSEUR ALSO
6070-86745-0003 STAY THEN DURING THE DAY TELL ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISHED
6070-86745-0004 VERY WELL BY HALF PAST TEN
6070-86745-0005 IS THIS COUNTESS UP YET
6070-86745-0006 THEIR VALET LEFT THE ROOM
6070-86745-0007 GOOD MORNING LUCIEN GOOD MORNING SAID ALBERT OUR PUNCTUALITY REALLY ALARMS ME
6070-86745-0008 YOU WHOM I EXPECTED TO LAST YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIXED WAS HALF PAST
6070-86745-0009 NO NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW DO NOT CONFOUND OUR PLANS
6070-86745-0010 YES HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGIS IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTH
6070-86745-0011 IT IS FOR THAT REASON YOU SEEK ME SO EARLY
6070-86745-0012 I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO HAVE A RISE FOR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 PESTS I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME TO GOVERNMENT YOU WOULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE
6070-86745-0014 BESIDES THAT DOES NOT CONCERN THE HOMES BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
6070-86745-0015 OUT WHAT ABOUT THE PAPERS
6070-86745-0016 IN THE ENTIRE WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLACK
6070-86745-0018 COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCEN
6070-86745-0019 WITH YOUR TALENTS YOU CAN MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM THAT TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
6128-63240-0001 THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FROM ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
6128-63240-0002 SHE IS GOING TO RISK THAT
6128-63240-0003 JEST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORKADAY ASPECT
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLARS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN CAN LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR PUBLIC PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN AND ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAGUE SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD
6128-63240-0009 AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE SWEET BRIM
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPOS AND ROARING RADICALS
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MARGARET
6128-63240-0012 HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUNGER WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6128-63240-0013 SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT THE LATTER
6128-63240-0014 HAVE YOU BEEN TO EUROPE
6128-63240-0015 NO I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES IT BUT SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPERPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LENA
6128-63240-0018 ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE
6128-63240-0019 BUT MISSUS LENA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0020 ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE WOULD COME BACK FOR
6128-63240-0021 BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BUXTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0022 THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY MOVEMENTS
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED AROUND HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AN AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED THE SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNEY'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS NANCY'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE'RE GOING TO A PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LUNE'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSLOW THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO AE OTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNOR'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002 RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP IT THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOUSES HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY TWENTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THERE HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0009 OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF ANYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AT ALL
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HERE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0012 HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN SO THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BAILER RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63244-0000 MISSUS CHANCELLOR HERSELF HAD THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE LADIES ON BEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT A BALLOT
6128-63244-0002 PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK OF THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORM WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
6128-63244-0004 OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A DELIGHTFUL PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0005 ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FANDER WHO LIVED AT RUXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINERS SUPPOSED BUT THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0007 SHE WAS TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE
6128-63244-0008 THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0009 CHARLIE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WHITE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH MOST
6128-63244-0010 OLIVE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MISSUS BARRINGER COULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
6128-63244-0011 IF THIS BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING
6128-63244-0012 OUR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE FEELINGS
6128-63244-0013 RAISE THE STANDARD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME THEIR THOUSAND NAMES
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE GOOD CURRANTS MISSUS FARVENDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0015 SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSION AND RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0016 I OUGHT TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THEIR SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BANDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
6128-63244-0018 THAT UNHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
6128-63244-0019 THERE WERE HER SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THEIR DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT THE JUST REVOLUTION IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERY THING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTAL BLOODSTAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0021 THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMEN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF THEIR BEING TO A CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUN WISE MIST OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY IS SUCCESS
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BIRD'S EYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR OR COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEM ALREADY A MARTYR
6128-63244-0024 OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG AND WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OR AN IMPULSE TO HERSELF
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES AS THE OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
6432-63722-0000 BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YOU FIGURE ON DOIN SOME DETECTIN AND GIVE UP FISHIN
6432-63722-0001 AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWISTS THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
6432-63722-0002 I'M GOING OFF FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING AND MAYBE NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
6432-63722-0003 GET READY SHAG YASER COLONEL
6432-63722-0004 AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN CONNEXION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
6432-63722-0005 PINKUS AND DONOVAN HAVEN'T THEY CARROLL YUP
6432-63722-0006 CAROL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED AND WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
6432-63722-0007 ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON THAT CASE GIRL
6432-63722-0008 BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT COLONEL THAN THAT CATTLE
6432-63722-0009 AND PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED COLONEL ASHLEY
6432-63722-0010 WE'VE GOT OUR PLAN AND THAT'S ALL WE WANT
6432-63722-0011 WE'RE ON THE DARCY CASE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YES
6432-63722-0012 I M WORKING IN THE INTEREST OF THE YOUNG MAN
6432-63722-0013 IT'S JEST ONE OF EM COINCIDENCES LIKE
6432-63722-0014 BUSTED THIS HEAD IN WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE OF A PAIR
6432-63722-0015 GAD EXPLAINED THE GIRL
6432-63722-0016 THE SAME PAIR I WAS GOING TO BUY
6432-63722-0017 LOOK HERE CYRIL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
6432-63722-0018 BUT THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGAFFUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63722-0020 NOW I'M AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DO IT HAPPEN
6432-63722-0021 PHUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED SHAR ALI
6432-63722-0022 ANYHOW HE AND CHUD DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL IT SEEMS
6432-63722-0023 NEIGHBOURS OFTEN HEARD EM SCRAPING A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
6432-63722-0024 TOWARD DARK A MAN WENT IN TO BUY THE LAMP
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH A HEAD BUSTED IN AND HIS HEAVY CANDLESTICK NEAR IT
6432-63722-0026 SURELY HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
6432-63722-0027 MAY BE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOES TALKED IN THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0028 AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT YES IT IS HERE
6432-63722-0029 THAT'S THE WATCH ANNOUNCED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE REACHING IN FOR IT GOING JUST SEE
6432-63722-0030 YOU'RE NOT AS SQUEAMISH AS ALL THAT WERE YOU JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DEAD MAN'S HANDS AND A WOMAN'S
6432-63722-0031 AND DONALGAN'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SCEPTICAL
6432-63722-0032 YES IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUGH ENDS ON IT
6432-63722-0033 WHEN I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
6432-63722-0034 IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN THIS A BIT
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHING THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE SMALL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS SPARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL
6432-63722-0038 AND DONOMAN TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
6432-63722-0039 ASKED THE SUSPICIOUS DETECTIVE YES
6432-63722-0040 DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF ON IT WHATEVER YOU DO WHY
6432-63722-0041 SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS WANT

6432-63722-0045 I WANT TO TALK OVER DARCY'S CASE WITH YOU THE COLONEL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD THOUGHT HAD TALKED AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
6432-63722-0046 WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OUT LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0047 RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT WOULD BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION
6432-63722-0048 AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH THAT SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0049 AND YOU I DON'T MEAN IT EITHER
6432-63722-0050 BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I SAY

6432-63722-0059 THAT THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW
6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILLFULLY PULLED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
6432-63723-0001 AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMPISH INTO THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
6432-63723-0002 THE REASON SHE ASKED FOR NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENNETH
6432-63723-0003 NO I WASN'T THINKING OF YOU
6432-63723-0004 PERHAPS DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY

6432-63723-0007 IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED VIOLENT CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER BUT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0009 THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT THAT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
6432-63723-0010 AARON GRAFTON'S TREATMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED
6432-63723-0011 HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012 SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND THAT SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0013 BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO RESPONSE
6432-63723-0014 LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PUBLICLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY FUNERAL FEE
6432-63723-0016 OH BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0017 THAT IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP
6432-63723-0018 REALLY I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDERER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELLER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0020 IT HAD A DOUBLE INVITATION SO TO SPEAK
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALLROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS ARE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
6432-63723-0022 LARGE HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
6432-63723-0023 IN A SMALLER SPACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
6432-63723-0024 AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH I WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RACHFORD HAD MARRIED
6432-63723-0025 TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED MONEY MONEY
6432-63723-0026 AND IN A WORD IT WAS TRUE
6432-63723-0027 SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING HER OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
6432-63723-0028 AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL THAT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
6432-63723-0029 THEN IT WAS SAID OF THE LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
6432-63723-0030 BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS ARE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
6432-63723-0031 IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME ABOUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL
6432-63723-0032 MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW ELSIE FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING TO BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
6432-63723-0033 I DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0034 I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT WILL TAKE TIME
6432-63723-0035 IT'S HARD FOR MISS MATSON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP LIKE A MAJOR
6432-63723-0036 SO HIM GOT BAIL WHO PUT IT UP
6432-63723-0037 IT WAS HIGHT LARCH
6432-63723-0038 I TOOK HARRY AWAY A WHILE AGO
6432-63723-0039 BUT HIS ARE PRETTY UNCERTAIN SHOES TO BE ON JUST THE SAME
6432-63723-0040 ONLY THAT I DARCY HESITATED AND LOOKED RED
6432-63723-0041 GOOD EVENING COLONEL HE CALLED GENIALLY WILL YOU JOIN ME FOR A WELSH RABBIT
6432-63723-0042 THANK YOU YOU
6432-63723-0043 I'M AFRAID MY DIGESTION ISN'T QUITE UP TO THAT AS I'VE HAD TO CUT OUT THE FISHING OF LATE
6432-63723-0044 NOW AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE STORE ON THE EVENING OF THE MURDER
6432-63723-0045 THE STOPPED CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU ANYTHING THEORY
6432-63723-0046 THERE WERE THREE OF THEM THE CENTER FIGURE BEING THAT OF HARRY KING AS HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOXICATED
6432-63723-0047 THAT IT IS NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES IT HAPPENED TO BE SO NOW
6432-63723-0048 I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTURED TONES HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO USE BUT OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE USE OF LATE
6432-63723-0049 I ASKED WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED THE OTHER WE'VE MISSED YOU
6432-63723-0050 I SAYS I WAS GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY THOUGH WITH AN EFFORT
6432-63723-0051 WHY POLONIUS I ASKED
6432-63723-0052 BECAUSE YOUR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
6432-63723-0053 THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BIT FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
6432-63723-0054 IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMANCE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
6432-63723-0055 I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING BUT I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
6432-63723-0056 THAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELR
6432-63723-0057 NOT HARRY KING HAS IT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY
6938-70848-0000 EVEN THE SUN COME OUT PALE AND WATERY AT NOON
6938-70848-0001 THE COLDS OF RHEUMATISM OF THE RAINY MONTHS VANISHED
6938-70848-0002 ASKED A WALKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YUNKERS
6938-70848-0003 WELL DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US THE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARM IN A SLING
6938-70848-0004 HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM TO THE DEVILS
6938-70848-0005 WHO ARE YOU TO DISTURB THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS LENIN A GERMAN
6938-70848-0006 WHO ARE YOU A COUNTER INVOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THE BELOVED ADAM
6938-70848-0007 YOU CALL YOURSELVES THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU WERE NOT THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA
6938-70848-0008 THE PUSANTS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS
6938-70848-0009 WE KNOW WHAT THE PEASANTS WILL SAY WEREN'T THEY WORKING MEN LIKE OURSELVES
6938-70848-0010 THIS MAN HAS ESPECIALLY WELCOMED A CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PEASANTS
6938-70848-0011 THIS LAST WAS THE YOUNG GENERAL WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
6938-70848-0012 WHEREUPON THE OLD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE LEFT THE HOUSE
6938-70848-0013 DOWN BY HIM THEY SHRIEKED
6938-70848-0014 FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN TO THE BOLSHEVIKI
6938-70848-0015 UPON MY RETURN I'VE VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANYONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
6938-70848-0016 MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STRATUS OF THE EXECUTOR COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
6938-70848-0017 BY DECLINING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO PLOT THE RE ELECTION OF THE EXECUTING COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LITTLE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THAT DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
6938-70848-0020 THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO SPEAK WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
6938-70848-0021 FOLLOWED THEM OLENIN LISTENED TO NOW WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
6938-70848-0022 THE FIRST AGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISTS AND THE LANDOWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE KUGHSY RELATED
6938-70848-0023 THE DUMESS AND ZAMSDOOFS WERE DROPPED
6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN DECLARED
6938-70848-0025 HE SPOKE IN THE RUM CONVENTION
6938-70848-0026 THE RELIGIONS WILL SAVE US IN THE END
6938-70848-0027 BUT THE PRESENT MOMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS INVINCIBLE
6938-70848-0028 A WILL OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN THE HALL
6938-70848-0029 A NEW HUMANITY WILL BE BORN OF THIS WORD
6938-70848-0030 I GREET YOU WITH THIS CHRISTENING OF A NEW RUSSIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM
7018-75788-0000 THEN I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED IN HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD
7018-75788-0001 BEHIND A SHIP WAS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THE DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
7018-75788-0002 HEARING THIS I WAS SORE TROUBLED REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED FROM THE APE MIND
7018-75788-0003 UPON THIS HE BROUGHT ME A COTTON BAG AND GIVING IT TO ME SAID TAKE THIS BAG AND FILL IT WITH PEBBLES FROM THE BEACH AND GO FORTH IN THE COMPANY OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO WHOM I WILL GIVE A CHARGE RESPECTING THEE
7018-75788-0004 DO AS THEY DO AND BELIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FURTHER THY RETURN VOYAGE TO THY NATIVE LANDS
7018-75788-0005 THEN THEY CARRIED ME TO THE BEACH WHERE I FILLED MY BAG WITH PEBBLES LARGE AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLK ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH BEARING A BAG LIKE MINE FILLED WITH PEBBLES
7018-75788-0006 TO THESE HE ADMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO THEIR CARE AND SAYING THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY GET HIS DAILY BREAD AND YOU WILL EARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
7018-75788-0007 NOW SLEEPING UNDER THESE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES WHEREUPON MY COMPANIONS BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING OUT THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE FOLK
7018-75788-0008 WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAYA
7018-75788-0009 BUT IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINTH NIGHT
7018-75788-0010 IT CEASED NOT SAILING TILL WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT BUSSORAH
7018-75788-0011 THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTERS AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FORGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STOREHOUSES
7018-75788-0012 AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GREAT PROFIT AND GAIN I MADE
7018-75788-0013 NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING MOHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL CREATURES BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND WISHED HIM THE GOOD DAY
7018-75788-0014 HERE I FOUND A GREAT SHIP READY FOR SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD IN THEM GOODS OF PRICE SO I EMBARKED MY BALES THEREIN
7018-75788-0015 FINALLY AMONGST YOU IS ONE RIGHTEOUS WHOSE PRAYERS THE LORD WILL ACCEPT
7018-75788-0016 PRESENTLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE MOUNTAIN AND BROKE UP AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD OF HER PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75788-0017 BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS COLOUR AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE NEIGHBORS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
7018-75788-0018 EACH THAT DIED WE WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTHES AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE TILL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT A LITTLE PROVISION LEFT I WHO IS WONT TO HAVE SO MUCH
7018-75788-0019 BUT THAT IS MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT
7018-75789-0000 WHEN I WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST NIGHT
7018-75789-0001 THEN SIGNED FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND CORMORINE ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIP'S SIDE PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD MAKING ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
7018-75789-0002 LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE ON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS THE NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
7018-75789-0003 I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED TO THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON A RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT IN MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0005 WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN A LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
7018-75789-0006 BUT I WAS DELIGHTED ON MY ESCAPE FROM THE RIVER
7018-75789-0007 WHEN THEY THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD THEM NOT AND MADE THEM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER
7018-75789-0008 OH MY BROTHER ANSWERED HE WE ARE HUSBANDMEN AND TILLERS OF THE SOIL WHO CAME OUT TO WATER OUR FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS AND FINDING THEE ASLEEP ON THIS RAFT LAID HOLD OF IT AND MADE IT FAST BY US AGAINST THOU SHOULDEST WAKE AT THY LEISURE
7018-75789-0009 I ANSWERED FOR ALLAH'S SAKE O MY LORD ERE I SPEAK GIVE ME SOMEWHAT TO EAT FOR I AM STARVING AND AFTER ASK ME WHICH THOU WILT
7018-75789-0010 WHEN IT IS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SECOND NIGHT
7018-75789-0011 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HAD TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING THAT HE MAY ACQUAINT HIM WITH HIS ADVENTURES
7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH HER CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0013 SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH A MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND
7018-75789-0014 QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US ON MY HEAD AND EYES BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST US WITH THY COMPANY

7018-75789-0016 THEN I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND OF ALL MY INTIMATES OR ACQUAINTANCES IN THE ISLAND AND EMBARKED WITH THE MERCHANTS AFORESAID
7018-75789-0017 HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY HITHER
7018-75789-0018 WITH STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND UPON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUESTS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
7018-75789-0019 HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THIS AND AS FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST ALL WITNESSED
7018-75789-0020 PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GIVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRYMAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED
7018-75789-0021 SUCH THEN O MY BROTHERS IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL ME IN MY SIXTEENTH VOYAGE AND TO MORROW INSHALLAH
7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH WAS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX
7018-75789-0023 NOW IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS WAS WONT
7018-75789-0025 THE ELEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN
7018-75789-0026 KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE AND ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENTS AND MIRTH AND MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGHDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONE HAD CLIMBED TO THE MASTHEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IT IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT TWO WHOSO COME HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS A SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NO DOUBT MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYBODY ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO NATTERBATH'S GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF RETAINING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAWYER MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BI ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DONTING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTERS
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATHLESS HUSH
7105-2330-0007 THE SEAMAN DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE
7105-2330-0008 THE JURY FIND THE PRISONERS GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISH TO ADD A WRITER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A VII ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS ON HAND
7105-2330-0010 AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THAT POLE A JUNIOR CONSUL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
7105-2330-0011 FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO AWFUL TO THINK OF
7105-2330-0012 OUR MAJESTY LAST TIME WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN
7105-2330-0013 SEVEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MIGHT AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTER BATH IS OUT BEFORE THE POLL OPENS
7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RED RUPPES INN TO NIGHT
7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRILOGIC REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
7105-2330-0017 HE EXCLAIMED WON'T NOT GO
7105-2330-0018 HE SAYS HE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM ABOUT AND HE'S NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW
7105-2330-0019 SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A RELEASED PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ELEMENTS
7105-2330-0020 ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BOND
7105-2330-0021 PAUL OPENS OF FIVE MINUTES
7105-2330-0022 IS PLATO BUFF OUT YET
7105-2330-0023 IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHY IT
7105-2330-0024 THIS CHIEF ORGANIZER RANG OFF
7105-2330-0025 THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING OF DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
7105-2330-0026 CAN'T YOU GET A SQUARE PERMIT ASKED THE ORGANIZER
7105-2330-0027 I'LL TRY SAYS THE HOME SECRETARY AND WENT TO THE TELEPHONE
7105-2330-0028 EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWDS OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WE'LL VOTE THE OTHER WAY
7105-2330-0029 HER TELEGRAM WAS BROUGHT IN
7105-2330-0030 IT WAS FROM THE CENTRE COMEDY ROOMS AT NEMESIS
7105-2330-0031 WITHOUT A HAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND
7105-2330-0032 AND A QUARTER PAST TEN HALF PAST
7105-2330-0033 HAVE YOU ANY BAND INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY NATURE TO CARRY
7105-2330-0034 DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANIZER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS OTHER SORT OF THINGS
7105-2330-0035 THE WARDERS HAVE A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW MEN THEMSELVES
7105-2330-0036 LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAYS THE CHIEF ORGANISER
7105-2330-0037 THE POPULAR SONG OF THE MOMENT REPLIED AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT AND THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONERS STRODE FORTH TO FREEDOM
7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF THE KING HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0040 THE SEAT WAS USED AFTER ALL BY A NARROW MATURITY
7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENSE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTER BALL FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
7105-2340-0000 WITH THAT NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIS HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON HE WANTED IN ONE'S HOUSE
7105-2340-0001 WELL THE FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID THE HUSBAND OR WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE ESTATE
7105-2340-0002 BESIDES CYNICISM ABROAD HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIS FAILING
7105-2340-0003 WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY NOT MERELY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVE NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THAT THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY
7105-2340-0004 WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE UPON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRED PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTEREFFECTS OF A POLO ACCIDENT
7105-2340-0005 A WILFRED FICHNCOTE HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONORS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRED HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK
7105-2340-0006 AND YOUR REPUTATION WAS AN UNPLEASANT ONE
7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOL DAYS ONWARDS HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF CLEPTIMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION
7105-2340-0008 THE SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEON COLE TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THEIR CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRED SAYING HE'S PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS
7105-2340-0009 SIGNED WILFRED PIGEONOTE
7105-2340-0010 I SUPPOSE HE'S BRINGING US A PRESENT FOR A SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS
7105-2340-0011 THE TALK FLITTED MARVELLOUSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER
7105-2340-0012 IN THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER THEIR EARNESTNESS AND AWKWARDNESS INCREASED
7105-2340-0013 OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETER SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA OF ENTERTAINING THE GUEST HERE THEY ALL ARE
7105-2340-0014 SUCH NICE USEFUL GIFTS OF FEW DIPLICATES OF COURSE
7105-2340-0015 SEVEN CREAM JUGS PUT ON PETER
7105-2340-0016 WE FEAR THAT WE MUST LIVE ON CREAM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
7105-2340-0017 OF COURSE SOME OF THESE CAN BE CHANGED
7105-2340-0018 I PUT IT DOWN AT THE CLARET JUG SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER OBJECT
7105-2340-0019 VIGILANCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY CROWNED WITH THE SENSES OF VICTORY
7105-2340-0020 AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR VISITOR MISSUS PETER EXPRESSED HER CONVICTIONS THAT HE HAD TAKEN SOMETHING
7105-2340-0021 HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I'M HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY OFF
7105-2340-0022 AND THE ONLY THING TO DO
7105-2340-0023 WILFRID WAS LATE IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT ANYTHING WAS AMISS
7105-2340-0024 IT IS AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAUS
7105-2340-0025 IT WAS A LITTLE PRESENT FROM MY MOTHER AND MYSELF FOR THEIR SILVER WEDDING
7105-2340-0026 I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND YOU SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT RATHER AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING ANOTHER
7105-2340-0027 WHAT SNATCHER HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THESE MANY YEARS
7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNEST AND PAGE ANDCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPAST OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
7105-2340-0029 HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED BLANKLY AND DOUBTFULLY AT ONE ANOTHER
7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THIS HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE ARE AT BREAKFAST
7105-2340-0031 SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MINUTE LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS
7105-2340-0032 THE PIGEON COATS HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETERS HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION
7105-2340-0033 PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAS LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
7105-2340-0034 MISSUS PETER TURNED TO THE GUESTS WITH CONFIDENTIAL COYNESS
7105-2340-0035 PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS IT TRANSCENDED FAMILY GOOD LORD
7105-2340-0036 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A CLLEPTOMANIA LIKE COUSIN'S SNATCHER
7105-2340-0037 BRAVE LITTLE WOMAN SAYS PETER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT
7902-96591-0000 I' FROM THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST
7902-96591-0001 DON'T CRYING HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO COME
7902-96591-0002 AND AND YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK TONES
7902-96591-0003 I WISH YOU COULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE
7902-96591-0004 BUT MY FATHER SIR RISDON GRAHAM HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE
7902-96591-0005 HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YOU SHALL NOT
7902-96591-0006 PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHIE WERE SILENT
7902-96591-0007 BUT AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALLED OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RAYSTROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 AND ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN A STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 YOU'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME AROUND
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE HESITATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALWAYS SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM MORE SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY OUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0018 YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE SHOULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0019 NOW THAT WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINK ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN OTHER PLACES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF HIS BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE AND THE HEAD WOULD NOT COME FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAYS BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
7902-96592-0000 SURE I'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES FATHER QUITE
7902-96592-0001 I'M GOING ALONG TO BREAKFAST
7902-96592-0002 SHALL I COME TOO FAR NO
7902-96592-0003 STOP HERE TILL SIR RISDON COMES DOWN AND TELL HIM I'M VERY SORRY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED OUT LAST NIGHT ONLY A BORN FOOL SAW JERRY ANDY'S LOBSTER BOAT COMING IN THE COVE AND CAME RUNNING TO SAY IT WAS A PARTY FROM THE CUTTER YES FATHER
7902-96592-0004 TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR WAY TO NIGHT
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHIE WRASTROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A CURIOUS DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER OF MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEALE THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHAT DID ANDY CALL MISTER GURR FATHER
7902-96592-0009 THERE IS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0010 AND I'M ANGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE
7902-96592-0011 NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THAT SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT OUT LOBSTER BOAT
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD REINE AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM THEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONEWORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 RUREN WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE
7902-96592-0016 HULLO HE CRIED WHO ARE YOU
7902-96592-0017 GO ON AND OPEN THE DOOR I WAS SHUT IN LAST NIGHT BY MISTAKE

7902-96592-0025 ARCHIE STEPPED OUT TO THE DOOR LISTENING BUT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND
7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRINCE AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE MACHINE PRESENTED ITSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON THIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOUR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDE THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR SWELLING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES I STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK INTO ITS SHEATH
7902-96592-0032 NO I CAN'T PART WITH THAT HA HA HA ANSWERED THE BOY JEERINGLY
7902-96592-0033 BUT I'LL YES ILL GIVE YOU A GUINEA IF YOU WILL LET ME OUT

7975-280057-0002 MY MOTHER WHO WAS BESHEBA FRISTAUUX OF INDEPENDENCE WAS A DAUGHTER OF RICHARD FRISTEAUX WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON AT NEW ORLEANS JACKSON COUNTY HAVING BEEN SO NAMED AT MY GRANDFATHER FRISTEAUX'S INSISTENCE
7975-280057-0003 I CANNOT REMEMBER WHEN I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SHOOT IT
7975-280057-0004 MY BROTHER JAMES WAS BORN JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT JOHN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE AND ROBERT IN NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE
7975-280057-0005 OUR ELDEST BROTHER RICHARD DIED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY
7975-280057-0006 MY FATHER WAS IN THE EMPLOY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND HAD THE MAIL CONTRACT FOR THREE HUNDRED MILES

7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SAME PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRYING TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON HIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISONVILLE SHE WENT INTO WAVERLEY WHERE SHE WAS HOUNDED CONTINUALLY
7975-280057-0018 ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT AT THE LESSINGTON WEEKLY

7975-280076-0009 AT THE TIME OF THE GALLETON BANK ROBBERING I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM PLEAZ TAILOR AND RECTOR
7975-280076-0010 THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SHERIFF BARTLEY AND FIFTY OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
7975-280076-0011 I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS THE FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY
7975-280076-0012 HE THEN WENT TO ARKANSAS AND RETURNED TO SAINT CLAIR COUNTY ABOUT THE FIRST OF MAY
7975-280076-0013 I WENT TO KANSAS WHERE OUR CATTLE WERE IN WOODSON COUNTY AT COLONEL RIDGES
7975-280076-0014 DURING THE SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS BUT AS THERE IS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED THAT SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE I WAS
7975-280076-0015 I WENT THROUGH INDEPENDENCE AND FROM THERE TO A S WEBB
7975-280076-0016 THERE I TOOK DINNER AND THEN WENT TO DOCTOR L W T WHITEMAN'S
7975-280076-0017 OUR BUSINESS THERE WAS TO SEE IF P WEST HE WAS NOT AT HOME BUT THE FAMILY WILL REMEMBER THAT WE WERE THERE
7975-280076-0018 WE CROSSED ON THE BRIDGE STAYED IN THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING WE RODE UP TOWARD THE CITY
7975-280076-0019 I MET SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AMONG THEM IS BOB HUDSPETH
7975-280076-0020 WE WERE NOT ON GOOD TERMS AT THE TIME NOR HAVE WE BEEN FOR YEARS
7975-280076-0021 POOR JOHN HE HAS BEEN HUNTED DOWN AND SHOT LIKE A WILD BEAST AND NEVER WAS A BOY SO INNOCENT
7975-280076-0022 DOCTOR L LEQUIS WAS HIS PHYSICIAN
7975-280076-0023 THERE WAS FIFTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS THERE WHO WILL TESTIFY IN ANY COURT THAT JOHN AND I WERE THERE
7975-280076-0024 HELVIN FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WERE ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND EACH OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE ABOVE FOR JOHN AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MISTER SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND WAS IN HIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MISTER AND MISS FICKLE AFTER THE SERVICE
7975-280076-0025 ABOUT THE LAST OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX I ARRIVED IN CARROLL PARISH LOUISIANA
7975-280076-0026 I STAYED THERE UNTIL THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE
7975-280076-0027 I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THE TIME I WAS AT NEUTIO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAY
7975-280076-0028 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY AT A DEER IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY
7975-280084-0000 I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED THEY SHOULD NOT SHOOT ANY ONE
7975-280084-0001 WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOODS BOXES AT THE CORNERS NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT INTO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
7975-280084-0002 WHEN HE CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
7975-280084-0003 J S ALLEN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE IS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
7975-280084-0004 GET OUT YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY'RE ROBBING THE BANK
7975-280084-0005 AND I CALLED TO THEM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS AT THE BRIDGE THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
7975-280084-0006 ALMOST IN THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT IN THE BANK
7975-280084-0007 CHADWELL WOODS AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
7975-280084-0008 IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN WOODS
7975-280084-0009 MEANTIME THIS STREET WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY HOT
7975-280084-0010 EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOOTER INSIDE AND I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7975-280084-0011 MISTER WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UP STAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
7975-280084-0012 CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILL'S MARE
7975-280084-0013 WHICH KEPT YOU SO LONG I ASKED PITTS
7975-280084-0014 AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THE BANK I TOOK THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0015 THERE'S THE MONEY OUTSIDE THE SAFE BOB ASKED
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL FITZ CHASED HIM WITH A BOOK
7975-280084-0017 THE FIRST ONE MISSED IT BUT THE SECOND WENT THROUGH HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
7975-280085-0000 THAT NIGHT IT STARTED TO RAIN AND WE RODE OUT OUR HORSES
7975-280085-0001 FRIDAY WE MOVED TOWARDS WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMPED BETWEEN ELYSIA AND GERMAN LAKE
7975-280085-0002 BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARM HOUSE CLOSE TO MANCADO
7975-280085-0003 THAT DAY A MAN NAMED DUNNING DISCOVERED US AND WE TOOK HIM PRISON
7975-280085-0004 FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY MY WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE AGREED NOT TO
7975-280085-0005 NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POST HASTE INTO MANCADDO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
7975-280085-0006 THE WHISTLE ON THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED AND WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
7975-280085-0007 HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH A PILLAR ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
7975-280085-0008 BUT THEY SOON AFTER GOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM BROKE MY STICK WITH A SHOT
7975-280085-0009 WE WERE IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG SAILED HORSES WHEN THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE ANIMALS AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
7975-280085-0010 SIX STEPS TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T OVALT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J CAVISSON
7975-280085-0011 FORMING IN LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE OF THEIR WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ROBBERS WERE DISCOVERED
7975-280085-0012 MAKE FOR THE FOREST I SAID EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
7975-280085-0013 THERE'S NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHANGE THEM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN
7975-280085-0014 I GOT UP AS A SIGNAL FOR THE CHARGE AND WE FIRED A VOLLEY
7975-280085-0015 ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN A SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELLED ON BOB IN SPITE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS A FLAG OF TRUCE
7975-280085-0016 SHERIFF GLISPSON OF WADAWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
7975-280085-0017 INCLUDING THOSE RECEIVED IN AND ON THE WAY FOR NORTHFIELD I HAD ELEVEN WOUNDS
7975-280085-0018 AND SHERIFF GLISPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTECTORATE THAT THE MINNESOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
8131-117016-0000 ASKED CAPTAIN MURDOCK
8131-117016-0001 BUT MARSBOARD HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO KILL IT OFF
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THAT TYPE OF MEN
8131-117016-0003 THIS STONEWALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DARELXON FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORIES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS SIR NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOPKEEPER AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0007 CAPTAIN MURDOCK WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR BUT NOW WAS ASKING FOR MORE MEN
8131-117016-0008 THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET THEM FOR IT
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED THE WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE RELIEF
8131-117016-0010 I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY WE WILL ON EARTH
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS SOME ONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT
8131-117016-0012 THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WOULD GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THE STONE WALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
8131-117016-0013 HE PICKED OUT SEVERAL OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FIVE WILL COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TO NIGHT PICK ANY ROUTE THAT'S OPEN OKAY THEN LET'S GO
8131-117016-0015 BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCK'S EYES FELL ON HIS EARTH COP
8131-117016-0016 TWO YEARS GORDON HESITATED
8131-117016-0017 AFTER A SECOND GORDON CURSED HIMSELF
8131-117016-0018 THEY BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT SECURITY THEN
8131-117016-0019 NOBODY HAD DARED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHORO BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0021 MOVING AND TWO GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE PRISONER WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THE FINELY TURNED CLUBS IN HIS HANDS
8131-117016-0024 GORDON'S EYES POPPED IN THAT
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWED THE SENTIMENT HIS OWN TONGUE WAS MOVING NOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER FOUR CROPS HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
8131-117016-0027 HE GOT HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEYS
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPPANS STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0029 TO FIND A PHONE OR CALL THE WAGON
8131-117016-0030 WE'RE NOT USING ENGINES MURDOCK TOLD HIM LINE THEM UP
8131-117016-0031 IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WAS CLUBBED CAREFULLY
8131-117016-0032 MURDOCK INDICATING ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS HARD AS GORDON'S FELT
8131-117016-0034 I KNOW THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD THE MAN
8131-117016-0035 NEVER THEY'D KILL ME I DON'T KNOW
8131-117016-0036 MURDOCK TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND TURNING TO THE WRETCHED TUFTS
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I LL FIND YOU
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER ALTHOUGH
8131-117016-0039 MURDOCK SENT ONE OF THE MEN TO BREAK UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD
8131-117016-0040 FOR THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN WHO'D BEEN BEATEN BEFORE
8131-117016-0041 GET A STRETCHER AND TAKE HIM WHEREEVER HE BELONGS HE ORDERED
8131-117016-0042 BUT THE CAPTAIN STIRRED SLIGHTLY SIGHING
8131-117016-0043 NO THE COPSE THEY'RE GIVING ME YOU'RE COVERED GORDON
8131-117016-0044 BUT THE STONEWALL GANG IS BACKIN WAIN
8131-117016-0045 BUT IT'S TO BE TOUGH ON THEM
8131-117016-0046 BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE BROUGHT A YELLOW TICKET FROM SECURITY
8131-117016-0047 MURDOCK BLINKED HE DROPPED HIS EYES CLOSELY
8131-117016-0048 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAIN WILL BE RE COLLECTED
8131-117016-0049 NOBODY WANTS YOU EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER
8131-117016-0050 EVER SEE A MARTIN ELECTION
8131-117016-0051 NO YOU'RE A FIER HE CAN'T LOSE
8131-117016-0052 AND THIS HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WHAT THE SPY OF GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE POOR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0055 COST ER MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE IZZY WAS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE SEES IT
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEAS OF THAT STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
8131-117016-0058 THE GROUPS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCK WAS TRAINED A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
8131-117016-0059 THAT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING WAS HERE
8131-117016-0060 HIS COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D SEEN ON EARTH
8131-117016-0061 BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAIN WAS RELECTED
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHOM BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORISED PRECINCT HOUSE
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANYTHING HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117017-0002 AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HELEN'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117017-0003 GORDON HIT THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MARRS SPEAKER LET OUT A SHRILL WHISTLE
8131-117017-0004 THE GUNS SUDDENLY SEEMED TO BE FLOURISHING EVERYWHERE
8131-117017-0005 YOU CAN'T DO IT FROM ME
8131-117017-0006 I'M REFORMED I' AM GOING STRAIGHT
8131-117017-0007 YOU DAMNED COPSE CAN'T ONO WAS BLUBBERING
8131-117017-0008 ONE LOOK WAS ENOUGH THE WORK PAPERS HAD A TELL TALE OVER THICKENING OF THE SIGNATURE THAT HAD SHOWED UP ON OTHER PAPERS OBVIOUSLY FORGERIES
8131-117017-0009 SOME WENT AWAY AS GORDON AND THE OTHER COPP WENT TO WORK BUT MOST OF THEM WEREN'T SQUEAMISH
8131-117017-0010 WHEN IT WAS OVER THE TWO FIXED UP THEIR WHIMPERING CAPTIVE
8131-117017-0011 JENKINS THE OTHER COPER HAD BEEN HOLDING THE WALLET
8131-117017-0012 MUST HAVE BEEN MAKING A BIG FIGHT IN SOMETHING FIFTY FIFTY
8131-117017-0013 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OVER TWO THOUSAND CREDITS IN HIS WALLET
8131-117017-0014 WHEN GORDON AND JENKINS CAME BACK MURDOCK TOSSED THE MONEY TO THEM FILLED IT
8131-117017-0015 WHATVER COMES TO HAND GOVERNOR
8131-117017-0016 LIKE THE SOCIAL LAW GORDON ASKED HIM

8131-117017-0027 THANKS IZZIE THANKS YOU
8131-117017-0028 THAT KID POCKETED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY NODDING
8131-117017-0029 THE LITTLE GUY KNEW MARS AS A FEW OTHERS DID APPARENTLY FROM ALL SIDES
8131-117017-0030 AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COPPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN ISSY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USE THE INFORMATION WITH A BEAT SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT ON THE UPPER BRACKETS HE'D STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS
8131-117017-0031 THE CAPTAIN LOOKED COMPLETELY BEATEN AS HE CAME IN THE ROOM AND DROPPED ONTO THE BENCH
8131-117017-0032 GO ON ACCEPTIN IT

8131-117029-0004 GORDON CAME TO A ROW OF TEMPORARY BUBBLES INDIVIDUAL DWELLINGS BUILT LIKE THE DOME BUT OPAQUE WITH PRIVACY
8131-117029-0005 THEY HAD BEEN LUCKILY

8131-117029-0007 FATTY'S PLACE WAS STILL OPEN THOUGH THE CROOKED TABLES HAD BEEN REMOVED GORDON DROPPED TO A STOOL SLIPPING OFF HIS HELMET

8188-269288-0027 JUST AT MIDNIGHT SHE ROSE WITH A SIGH TO PREPARE FOR BED
8188-269288-0028 I LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM
8188-269288-0029 NOW I REMEMBER HE GOT A LETTER WHICH UPSET HER VERY MUCH AND WENT OUT
8188-269288-0030 LISIE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND FLUNG IT OPEN SHE PUT HER HEAD OUT AND TRIED TO PEER INTO THE DARKNESS BUT THE MOON HAD ALREADY SET AND SHE COULD NOT SEE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF YARDS IN FRONT OF HER
8188-269288-0031 SHE IS A VERY QUEER ERRATIC CREATURE AND THAT LETTER THERE WAS BAD NEWS ON THAT LETTER
8188-269288-0032 WHAT CAN SHE BE DOING OFF BY HERSELF
8188-269288-0033 LISLIE LEFT THE ROOM BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY GONE A DOZEN PACES DOWN THE CORRIDOR BEFORE SHE MET ME RETURNING
8188-269288-0034 ANNIE'S EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT HER CHEEKS WERE NO LONGER PALE AND THERE WAS A BRILLIANT FIRE IN THEM
8188-269288-0035 SHE DID NOT TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE OF LISLY BUT GOING INTO THE ROOM SHUT THE DOOR

8188-269288-0051 SHE TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND LIT A CANDLE WHICH SHE PUT BEHIND HER SCREEN THEN PREPARED TO GET IN TO BED
8188-269288-0052 ANNIE'S MANNER IS VERY MYSTERIOUS
8188-269288-0053 ANNIE DID NOT MEAN TO CONFIDE IN ANYTHING THAT NIGHT AND THE KINDEST THING WAS TO LEAVE HER ALONE
8188-269288-0054 TIRED OUT LISLIE HERSELF DROPPED ASLEEP
8188-269288-0055 HELEN IS THAT YOU SHE CALLED OUT
8188-269288-0056 THERE WAS NO REPLY BUT THE SOUND OF HURRYING STEPS CAME QUICKER AND QUICKER NOW AND THEN THERE WERE INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN
8188-269288-0057 WHY THIS WILL KILL ME MY HEART WILL BREAK THIS WILL KILL ME
8188-269290-0000 THE GUILD OF SAINT EUSTACE
8188-269290-0001 IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER THAT EVENING LISLIE RAN TO HER ROOM TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR HER VISIT TO EAST HALL

8188-269290-0010 WRAPPING A PRETTY BLUE SHAWL ROUND HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS SHE TURNED TO ANNA

8188-269290-0016 JANE HERRIOT'S VOICE WAS HEARD IN THE PASSAGE
8188-269290-0017 AS SHE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR SHE HEARD IT WAS TURNED IN THE LOCK

8188-269290-0032 SCARCELY LIKELY REPLIED LISLY SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO COME TO THE MEETING
8188-269290-0033 BUT MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LIZ AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
8188-269290-0034 MISS LAUDERDAE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHER TUTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE DIFFERENT HALLS ON A RAISED PLATFORM
8188-269290-0035 THEN A WAR CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE WAS ANY COLCHESTER
8188-269290-0036 THE PHYSICAL PART OF YOUR TRAINING AND ALSO THE MENTAL PARTS ARE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED IN THIS GREAT HOUSE OF LEARNING SHE CONTINUED BUT THE SPIRITUAL PART IT SEEMS TO ME OUGHT NOW TO BE STRENGTHENED
8188-269290-0037 SEE HERE AND ONCE AGAIN HERE
8188-269290-0038 SHE UTTERED HER DREAM REMARK STANDING UP
8188-269290-0039 MARGERY AND EILEEN ARE CLOSE TO HER
8188-269290-0040 I WILL TALK WITH YOU BELLE ARCHIESON PRESENTLY SHE SAID
8188-269290-0041 THE NAMES OF THEIR PROPOSED MEMBERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO ME BEFORE THIS DAY WEEK

8188-269290-0043 YOU ASK SHE CONCLUDED
8188-269290-0044 GOD ANSWERS TO EACH OF YOU YOU HAVE
8188-269290-0045 THE WORLD SAYS NO I AM NOT BUT GOD SAYS YES
8188-269290-0046 OUR MEN ARE YOUR BROTHERS
8188-269290-0047 BUT ALL WHO SIN ALL WHO SUFFER YOU ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RESPONSIBLE
8188-269290-0048 AFTER THE ADDRESS THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
8188-269290-0049 IT WAS PAST TEN O'CLOCK WHEN THEY LEFT THE HALL
8188-269290-0050 JUST AS SHE WAS DOING SO MISS FRERE CAME
8188-269290-0051 EMMY COLCHESTER IS YOUR ROOMFELLOW IS SHE NOT SHE SAID
8188-269290-0052 I SEE BY YOUR FACE MISSUS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DEPRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING ARE YOU KEEPING ANYTHING BACK
8188-269290-0053 I AM AFRAID I AM REPLIED LIZZIE DISTRESSED AT HER TONE
8188-269290-0054 I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS LOTERDALE EXCEPT A VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED HERSELF
8188-269290-0055 HIS EXCUSES MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
8188-269290-0056 THE WOMAN WHO BREAKS THE RULES HAS TO BE PUNISHED
8188-269290-0057 WILL TELL HER
8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHILE THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS IN ENGLAND
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MONT MORRIS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICIALS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE FATAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0004 WHEN THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER IT
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW THE FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME BEFORE MYSELF
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION WAKE THE SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UP A COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVE LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALL FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0007 HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE CONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOUR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE CORNERWEALTH
8188-274364-0008 MY LORDS I HAVE NOW TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIP'S A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG VANE FALLING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THE MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO BIM WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MIGHT DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT
8280-266249-0000 OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THIS PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WILL BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORES AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOR
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT A SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0004 THERE ARE SOME WISE LOOKING PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0005 BESIDES OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RONAD LAUGHING
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ADDED THAT LITTLE GROUP YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I SUPPOSE
8280-266249-0007 AND WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF THE HERALD I SHOULD JUDGE
8280-266249-0008 SO YOU SON WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009 HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY LITTLE BOY
8280-266249-0010 SUPPOSE YOU AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRANKLY
8280-266249-0011 I DO INDEED THOUGH PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF THESE AILMENTS
8280-266249-0012 DOUBTLESS THAT IS THE CASE RETURNED MISTER DINSMORE
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMAN'S CABIN WHERE THERE WAS A LIGHT
8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND MAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT AND TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF A DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONTRACTED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0017 IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND SHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENTS
8280-266249-0018 THAT THE FRENCH POLYTECHNICO INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS UPON THE MIND
8280-266249-0019 NOTICE THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKER AND CHEWERS
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN THAT CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0021 AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION IN THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0022 HENCE A RESORT OF CIDER AND BEER
8280-266249-0023 NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT OUR OWN
8280-266249-0024 FOR YE ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH WERE GODS
8280-266249-0025 WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR ENEMIES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES OF LIVING SACRIFICE WHOLLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAD BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALEY
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND NO THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED AROUND A TABLE AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0030 THEY'RE GAMBLING AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0031 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN DIRECTION
8280-266249-0032 NO SIR HE IS NOT
8280-266249-0033 AND THE DOOR WERE SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TOO
8280-266249-0034 NOW THE VOICES CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0035 HIS VISITOR WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING TO HIS STATEROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0036 WHAT DO IT MEAN CRIED ONE
8280-266249-0037 A VENTRILOQUIST ON BOARD OF COURSE RETURNED ANOTHER LET'S FOLLOW AND SEE THE FUN
8280-266249-0038 I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REMARKED THE FIRST LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT CAME ON
8280-266249-0039 THAT FELLOW NICK WARD IS A NOTED BLACK FLAG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE
8280-266249-0040 WHO ASKED THE MATE I HAVE SEEN NOT ONE UP HERE THOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THE STEERAGE
8280-266249-0041 THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8280-266249-0042 A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN ITS POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0043 LET ME OFF YELLED WARD MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIS ARMS
8280-266249-0044 I DINKS NO I DINKS I DID YOU VON LISSEN RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
8280-266249-0045 THIS GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0046 MISTER LILBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WAR'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0047 YET IT WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSION
8280-266249-0048 SHE KEPT IT UP TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT
8280-266249-0049 THEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN HIS STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BRING IT UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0050 AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A QUICK ONE AND THE STAKES WERE VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0051 THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREEN BACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CATCH IT
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE SOUND
8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO COOL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS WITH A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
8280-266249-0054 IT CAME FROM UNDER THAT TABLE GASPED WARD LOOK WHAT'S THERE LOOK YOURSELF
8280-266249-0055 WHAT CAN IT HAB BEEN THEY ASKED EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0056 OH NONSENSE WHAT FOOL WE ARE
8280-266249-0057 IT WAS THE LAST GAME OF CARDS FOR A TRIP
8280-266249-0058 THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER HIS SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0059 TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DAILIES WERE IN VERY STRAIT CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0060 OH HOW KINDLY HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE

8280-266249-0062 ELSIE EXCLAIMED PRESSING HER HAND AFFECTIONATELY ARE WE NOT SISTERS IN CHRIST
8280-266249-0063 SHE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD BY FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS

8280-266249-0065 WE FEEL MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE ARE ONLY THE STEWARDS OF HIS BOUNTY AND BECAUSE HE HAS SAID INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME IT IS THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE AND DELIGHT TO DO EVERYTHING FOR HIS PEOPLE

8461-278226-0001 SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENT AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED A SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WEAR THE NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JUVAN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMISE HIM AND HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-278226-0003 I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES ON MODERN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
8461-278226-0004 I REMEMBERED ALL THE REUBENS SAYS AT THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
8461-278226-0005 SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH PEARL GRAY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOLS AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AYESHA BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0006 THAT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0007 BUT SHE FIXED ON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANY THING SHE HAD SEEN IN THE GALLERY
8461-278226-0008 PHILIP JOCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HIS WIFE MADE THAT DISCOVERY
8461-278226-0009 HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE PHILIPPA LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
8461-278226-0010 I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MOURNING ROOM AT JOCELYN ROCH
8461-278226-0011 SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ARTIST PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KIRSTY LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
8461-278226-0012 THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF AS THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
8461-278226-0013 BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS LITTLE ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARDS THE WORKS OF OTHERS
8461-278226-0014 I DON'T THINK HE WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A HOUSE
8461-278226-0015 YOULL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOR PHILIP IF YOU'LL SAY YES
8461-281231-0000 HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THE WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THEIR WALLS
8461-281231-0001 IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARD CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORKELESTONE
8461-281231-0002 AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH THE FEAR OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESSING HIM
8461-281231-0003 BUT ART THOU HE EXCLAIMED IN TERROR
8461-281231-0004 LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH EUREKA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TRACE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
8461-281231-0005 EXCLAIMED THE NOBLEMAN HO
8461-281231-0006 REMEMBER'ST THOU THE MAGAZINE OF FUEL THAT IS STORED BENEATH THESE APARTMENTS WOMAN
8461-281231-0007 THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID EURICA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO COULD EXTINGUISH THEM
8461-281231-0008 MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO REGULAR WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
8461-281231-0009 THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY THE BRECY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
8461-281231-0010 THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCES WAY INWARD IN DESPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
8461-281231-0011 TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL HER LEADER'S EFFORTS TO STOP THEM
8461-281231-0012 THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL WRUNG BY FURIOUS BLOWS
8461-281231-0013 AT LENGTH A BRACY FELL
8461-281231-0014 TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK THY PLEASURE FROM ME
8461-281231-0015 YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORT THEE TO KNOW
8461-281231-0016 EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT A PRISONER AND PERISH
8461-281231-0017 THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAMBERS
8461-281231-0018 RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH HIS THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS
8461-281231-0019 BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT ROUND DE BOEUF
8461-281231-0020 AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE UUREAH APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
8461-281231-0021 BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND DROVE THROUGH THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTERS
8461-281231-0022 AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AS SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED HER TYRANT
8461-281231-0023 WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORGLESTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
8461-281231-0024 HE LEFT A GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF KONIGSBERG AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTER OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ADDLESTANE WAS LAID
8461-281231-0025 DE BRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED THROUGH THE WOOD
8461-281231-0026 HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT AS THE MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING
8461-281231-0027 SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS STRONG WAR HORSE AND RODE OFF THROUGH A FOREST
8461-281231-0028 DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER JACOB
8461-281231-0029 AND WITH THIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET ABOUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION

8461-281231-0031 HE APPEALED TO DE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST A MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
8461-281231-0032 BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LYCAS THE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY
8461-281231-0033 HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THIS JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
8461-281231-0034 POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY HALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK ROUND AND TO INQUIRE INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
8461-281231-0036 SHE GAZED ACCORDINGLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A COLDER HEART THAN HERS
8461-281231-0037 AT THIS FEET WAS PLACED A TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
8461-281231-0038 THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THEIR SUPERIORS AND BESIDE THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
