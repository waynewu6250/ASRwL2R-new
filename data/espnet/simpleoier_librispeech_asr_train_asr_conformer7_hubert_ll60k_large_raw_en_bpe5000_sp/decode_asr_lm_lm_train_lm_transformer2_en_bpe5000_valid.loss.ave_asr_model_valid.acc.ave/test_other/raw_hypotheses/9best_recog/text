1688-142285-0000 THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKE ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWN STAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOPBOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SORRY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOPBOY WAS THE THING I LIKE BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU'RE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HARRY YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS BY SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 HIS FATHER DYING IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN A WORKHOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THAT DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WHILST HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARD TO HELP MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO FRIEND COMES FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISTER THORNTON IS NOT WONT I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LOVED MILTON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED ASKED HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0016 OH PAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARDS OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS MERE WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS HIGHER NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS HE EVER SAID THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGEN WERE HIS WORDS
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARED TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE GOOD AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER OUT IT COMES
1688-142285-0024 HOWEVER I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0025 BUT I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0026 PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL THAT
1688-142285-0027 I DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0028 BUT GOOD DAY CHILD
1688-142285-0029 THEY WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN HER BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON HAD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER UPON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVE IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF A MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE DONE IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTION SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNERS OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STARTED TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL BUSY HOW ARE YOU
1688-142285-0038 BETTER AND NOTHING BETTER IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
1688-142285-0039 NOT EXACTLY REPLIED ROBERT SMILING
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AN TIRED OF MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND OF BOOLAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED ROUND TO WALK ALONG SIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
1688-142285-0042 BUT FOR THE MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0043 THE LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
1688-142285-0044 BESSY DO YOU WISHED TO DIE
1688-142285-0045 BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE CRIED
1688-142285-0046 MUCH WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
1688-142285-0047 BUT WAS IT
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE THOUGH PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON
1688-142285-0049 I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAY FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
1688-142285-0050 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT THEN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW
1688-142285-0051 THE SHARPNESS IN THE EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY TURNED UP A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
1688-142285-0053 YOU'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GROVISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0054 BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHERE THEY ENTERED
1688-142285-0055 GASPED JESSY AT LAST
1688-142285-0056 BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN SAT BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENCE WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER YOU GAVE IT TO YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS
1688-142285-0059 NOW I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED SO
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0061 I KNOW WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
1688-142285-0062 THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG GENTLEMAN
1688-142285-0063 I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I HEARD NO NOT BY A BIG DEAL
1688-142285-0064 BUT WHO'S COME AT LAST AND WHO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HE'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHO KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT
1688-142285-0065 IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR TO WORK
1688-142285-0066 BUT THE GIRL THEN PLAYED IT THE MORE WITH MARGARET
1688-142285-0067 DON'T THINK HARDLY O HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
1688-142285-0068 I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOKED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF EITHER IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0069 THE FEVERISH COLOR CAME INTO HER CHEEKS AND THE FEVERISH FLAME IN HER EYE
1688-142285-0070 BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER YOU WILL OH MY HEART
1688-142285-0071 SHE PUT HER HAND TO IT AND BEGAN GHASTLY PALE
1688-142285-0072 MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT A WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
1688-142285-0073 PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAS PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED THAT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
1688-142285-0075 I'LL COME TO TOMORROW SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0076 MARGARET WENT VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
1688-142285-0077 SHE WAS LATE FOR TEA AT NIGHT
1688-142285-0078 HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERVANT THERE
1688-142285-0079 NO MAMMA THAT ANNE BARKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE

1688-142285-0083 WHAT WOULD YOU DO PAPA HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT
1688-142285-0084 WHILE I I WOULD APPLY IT TO SOME GOOD HOUSEMOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS
1688-142285-0085 VERY GOOD BUT WE MUST FIRST KISS OUR HOUSE MOTHER
1688-142285-0086 THE MOTHER OF WHOM HE SPOKE TO US SAID MARGUERITE
1688-142285-0087 MISTER THORNTON THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAYS MISTER HALE QUIETLY
1688-142285-0088 I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
1688-142285-0089 PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF HER PLACE
1688-142285-0090 SHE SOUNDS TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
1688-142285-0091 MY DEAR SAID MISTER HALE ALARMED PRAY DON'T GET OFF ON THAT IDEA
1688-142285-0092 I AM SURE AT ANY RATE HE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1688-142285-0093 TAKE NOTICE THAT THIS IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOURE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT

1998-29455-0037 NOR WAS IT SUNDAY ON WHICH THEY TOOK A REST AND WASHED THEIR SHIRTS ACCORDING TO MISTER FIELD'S RULE OF LIFE
1998-29455-0038 THEY DID NOT STAY THERE BUT WALKED OUT ACROSS THE DOWNS WHERE THE SKYLARKS WERE SINGING AND ON A DIP OF THE DOWNS CAME ON GREAT STONE WALLS AND TOWERS VERY STRONG AND GRAY

2033-164914-0001 THEN SHE SAID WHOMSOEVER THOU SEEST AWAKE HE IS THE RECITER
2033-164914-0002 THEN SAID THE EUNUCH ART THOU HE WHO REPEATED POETRY BUT NOW AS MY LADY HEARD HIM
2033-164914-0003 REJOINED THE EUNUCH WHO NOW WAS THE RECITER POINT HIM OUT TO ME

2033-164914-0007 AND HE ALSO IMPROVISED THE TWO FOLLOWING DISPATCHES
2033-164914-0008 WHEN NUSHAT AL ZAMAN HEARD THE FIRST IMPROVISATION SHE CALLED TO MIND HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER AND HER BROTHER AND THEIR WILUM HOME THEN SHE WEPT AND CRIED TO THE EUNUCH AND SAID TO HIM WOE TO THEE

2033-164914-0013 WHEN IT WAS THE SEVENTY THREE NIGHT
2033-164914-0014 BUT THE EUNUCH SAID I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE TILL THOU SHOW ME WHO IT WAS THAT RECITED THE VERSES FOR I DREAD RETURNING TO MY LADY WITHOUT HER
2033-164914-0015 NOW WHEN THE FIREMAN HEARD THESE WORDS HE FEARED FOR ZALKAN AND WEPT WITH EXCEEDING WEEPING AND SAID TO THE EUNUCH BY ALLAH IT WAS NOT I AND I KNOW HIM NOT
2033-164914-0016 SO GO THOU TO THY STATION AND IF THOU AGAIN MEET ANY ONE AFTER THIS HOUR RECITING AUGHT OF POETRY WHETHER HE BE NEARER OR FAR IT WILL BE I OR SOME ONE I KNOW AND THOU SHALT NOT LEARN OF HIM BUT BY ME
2033-164914-0017 THEN HE KISSED THE EUNUCH'S HEAD AND SPAKE HIM FAIR TILL HE WENT AWAY BUT THE CASTRATO FETCHED AROUND AND RETURNING SECRETLY CAME AND STOOD BEHIND A FIREMAN FEARING TO GO BACK TO HIS MISTRESS WITHOUT TIDINGS
2033-164914-0018 I SAY WHAT MADE MY IGNOMINY WHATE'ER THE BITTER CUP I DRAIN FAR BE FROM ME THY LAND TO FLEE NOR WILL I BOW TO THOSE WHO BLAME AND FOR SUCH LOVE WILL DEAL ME SHAME
2033-164914-0019 THEN SAID THE EUNUCH TO ZAD AL MAKAN PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY LORD
2033-164914-0020 O MY LORD CONTINUED THE EUNUCH AND SHAHRAZAD RECEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY

2033-164915-0000 AND ALMOST THESE
2033-164915-0001 THEN SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HE LIFTED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN FELL DOWN IN A FAINTING FIT
2033-164915-0002 WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW THIS CASE HE WONDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEHOW TO COVER THEM WAITED TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
2033-164915-0003 AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND UZT AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LEFT HER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THESE VERSES
2033-164915-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANTS HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM BUT HOW HE HAD GOT FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BUYING HOW HE HAD MADE A MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD GONE IN TO HER AND HOW THE KING THEIR SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARKAN
2033-164915-0005 BUT NOW COME TO THY MASTER AND BRING HIM QUICKLY TO ME
2033-164915-0006 THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED THE CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO ACCORDINGLY AND HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE STOCKER TILL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRDING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
2033-164915-0007 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE STALKER GIRDED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING O WOULD I KNEW WHAT WAS BECOME OF HIM
2033-164915-0008 I BELIEVE HE HATH DENOUNCED ME TO THE EUNUCH HENCE THESE PAGES ABOUT ME AND HE HATH MADE ME AN ACCOMPLICE IN THIS CRIME
2033-164915-0009 WHY DIDST THOU SAY I NEVER REPEATED THESE COUPLETS NOR DO I KNOW WHO REPEATED THEM WHEN IT WAS MY COMPANION
2033-164915-0010 BUT NOW I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE BETWEEN THIS PLACE AND BAGDAD AND WHAT BETIDETH THY COMRADE SHOULD BETIDE THEE
2033-164915-0011 TWAS AS I FEARED THE COMING ILLS DISTURBING BUT UNTO ALLAH WE ARE ALL RETURNING
2033-164915-0012 THEN THE EUNUCH CRIED UPON HER PAGES SAYING TAKE HIM OFF THE ASS
2033-164915-0013 AND HE ANSWERED I AM THE CHAMBERLAIN OF THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS KING SHARRKAN SON OF OMAR BIN AL NUMAN LORD OF BAGDAD AND OF THE LAND OF KHORASAN AND I BRING TRIBUTE AND PRESENTS FROM HIM TO HIS FATHER IN BAGHDAD
2033-164915-0014 SO FARE YE FORWARDS NO HARM SHALL BEFALL YOU TILL YOU JOIN HIS GRAND WAZIR BANDAN
2033-164915-0015 THEN HE BADE HIM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE SAID THAT HE WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO KING OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND THE TRIBUTE OF SYRIA
2033-164915-0016 SO IT WAS AGREED THAT WE GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARRKAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OF HIS FATHER'S REALM
2033-164915-0017 AND AMONGST THEM WERE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE CADET ZAU AL MAKAN FOR QUOTH THEY HIS NAME BE LIGHT OF THE PLACE AND HE HATH A SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HIGHZ THE DELIGHT OF THE TIME BUT THEY SET OUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOR AL HIJAZ AND NONE WOTTETH WHAT IS BECOME OF THEM
2033-164916-0000 SO HE TURNED TO THE WAZIR NADAN AND SAID TO HIM VERILY YOUR TALE IS A WONDER OF WONDERS
2033-164916-0001 KNOW O CHIEF WAZIR THAT HERE WHERE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED ME ALLAH HATH GIVEN YOU REST FROM FATIGUE AND BRINGETH YOU YOUR DESIRE AFTER THE EASIEST OF FASHIONS FOR THAT HIS ALMIGHTY WILL RESTORETH TO YOU ZOMA KHAN AND HIS SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN
2033-164916-0002 WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAYNE TELL ME A TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFELL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
2033-164916-0003 ZAUMAHAN BOWED HIS HEAD A WHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THE POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELLED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM ON THE RIGHT WAY
2033-164916-0004 THEN HE ADDED OH MY UNCLE HOW SHALL I DO WITH MY BROTHER SHAVAN
2033-164916-0005 AFTER A WHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE COOL TIDE SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
2033-164916-0006 WHEN IT WAS A SEVENTY EIGHTH NIGHT
2033-164916-0007 AND IN IT I REJOICED AT THE ACCESSION OF THE LIGHT OF THE PLACE
2033-164916-0008 LASTLY THE MINISTER WENT IN AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE ZAL MAKAN WHO ROSE TO MEET HIM SAYING WELCOME O WAZIR AND SIRE'S SONSPIERS
2033-164916-0009 MOREOVER THE SULTAN COMMANDED HIS WAZIR DANDAN CALL THE TEN DAYS HALT OF THE ARMY THAT HE MIGHT BE PRIVATE WITH HIM AND LEARN FROM HIM HOW AND WHEREFORE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN SLAIN
2033-164916-0010 HE THEN REPAIRED TO THE HEART OF THE ENCAMPMENT AND ORDERED THE POST TO HALT TEN DAYS
2414-128291-0000 WHAT HATH HAPPEN UNTO ME
2414-128291-0001 HE ASKED HIMSELF SOMETHING WARM AND LIVING QUICKENES ME IT MUST BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
2414-128291-0002 WHEN HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA WAS QUITE NIGH UNTO THEM THEN DID HE HEAR PLAINLY THAT A HUMAN VOICE SPAKE IN THE MIDST OF THE CANE AND APPARENTLY ALL OF THEM HAD TURNED THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THE SPEAKER
2414-128291-0003 BUT WHAT DO I HERE SEEK
2414-128291-0004 ANSWERED HE THE SAME THAT THOU SEEKST THOU MISCHIEF MAKER THAT IS TO SAY HAPPINESS UPON EARTH

2414-128292-0005 VERILY MY FOLLY HAD GROWN WEAK IN THE MOUNTAINS

2414-128292-0008 ALSO METHINKETH THAT AFTER ALL IT HATH A LONGER OR LESS THAN MINE
2414-128292-0009 FOR WHEN THE ARTUSTRA SCRUTINISED HIM WITH HIS GLANCE HE WAS FRIGHTENED AS BY A SUDDEN APPARITION SO SLENDER SWARTHY HOLLOW AND WORN OUT DID HIS FOLLOWER APPEAR

2414-128292-0017 SOMETIMES I MEANT TO LEAVE AND BEHOLD
2414-128292-0018 AND THEN ONLY DID I HIT THE TRUTH
2414-128292-0019 WHY HAVE I STILL INCLINATION
2414-128292-0020 HAVE I STILL A GOLD
2414-128292-0021 A HAVEN ACROSS WHICH MY SAIL IS SET
2414-128292-0022 FOR IT TOO I ASK AND SEEK I HAVE SOUGHT BUT I HAVE NOT FOUND IT
2414-128292-0023 OH ETERNAL EVERYWHERE O ETERNAL NOWHERE OH ETERNAL IN VAIN
2414-128292-0024 THOU ART MY JUDGE
2414-128292-0025 SAID HE AT LAST LOUDLY
2414-128292-0026 THY DANGER IS BUT SMALL THOU FREE SPIRIT AND WANDERER
2414-128292-0027 THEY SLEEP QUIETLY THEY ENJOY THAT NEW SECURITY
2414-128292-0028 BEWARE LEST IN THE END A NARROW FAITH CAPTURES THEE A HARD RIGOROUS DELUSION
2414-128292-0029 FOR NOW EVERYTHING THAT IS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTEST THEE
2414-128292-0030 THOU HAST LOVED THY GOAL
2414-128292-0031 THY POOR ROVER AND RAMBLER THOU TIRED BUTTERFLY
2414-128292-0032 WILT THOU HAVE REST AND A HOME THIS EVENING
2414-159411-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAHMIN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS AND CAUGHT HIM
2414-159411-0001 THE BRAHMIN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THIS CAGE YOU WILL EAT ME
2414-159411-0002 O FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN TRUTH THAT I WOULD NOT
2414-159411-0003 I SHALL NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND RETURN
2414-159411-0004 THEN THE BRAHMIN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE TURNED SO THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARD
2414-159411-0005 SO THE BRAHMIN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A BANDED TREE AND THE BRAHMIN SAID TO IT BANNANT TREE BANNON TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0006 ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE BANDED TREE
2414-159411-0007 THIS TIGER SAID THE BRAMIN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF ITS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LEFT HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME
2414-159411-0008 IT IS JUST THAT WE SHOULD DO SO OR NO
2414-159411-0009 LET THE TIGER EAT THIS MAN FOR MEN ARE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE
2414-159411-0010 SIR CAMEL SIR CAMEL CRIED THE BRAHMAN HEAR AND GIVE
2414-159411-0011 IN A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND A BULLOCK LYING BY THE ROADSIDE
2414-159411-0012 IS IT FAIR THAT THEY SHOULD DO SO OR NOT
2414-159411-0013 LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR THEY HAVE NO PITY
2414-159411-0014 THREE OUT OF THE SIX IN GIVING JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMIN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINE TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
2414-159411-0015 ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE NEGRO
2414-159411-0016 THE BRAHMIN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCK AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONES
2414-159411-0017 THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID JUDGMENT OF ALL IS AGAINST YOU OH BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0018 AFTER THIS THEY SOUGHT AN ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMIN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE VERDICT
2414-159411-0019 BUT THE ALLIGATORS SAYS WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KILL ME
2414-159411-0020 THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT THEN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINION OF THE SIXTH JUDGE
2414-159411-0021 THEN THE SIXTH WAS A JACKAL
2414-159411-0022 THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKO UNCLE JACKA SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0023 SHOW ME THIS PLACE
2414-159411-0024 AND THE GUARD THERE THE JACKALS SAID NOW BRAHMIN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD
2414-159411-0025 EXACTLY HERE WAS IT ASKED THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0026 EXACTLY HERE REPLIED THE BRAHMAN
2414-159411-0027 WHERE WAS THE TIVER THEN
2414-159411-0028 WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE TIGER JUMPING INTO A CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON THIS SIDE
2414-159411-0029 VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL BUT WE CANNOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY
2414-159411-0030 SHUT AND BOLTED SAYS THE BRAMIN
2414-159411-0031 NOW SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0032 WHEN THE BRAHMINS HAD DONE THIS THE JACKAL SAID OH YOU WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL TIGER
2414-159411-0033 WHEN A GOOD BRAHMIN OPENED YOUR CAVE DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WOULD MAKE
2414-159411-0034 PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEY FROM BRAHMAN
2414-159411-0035 YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY AND MINE HIS
2414-165385-0000 THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUET AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLATTERING PAM BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILIZED MONKEY
2414-165385-0001 THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS INTENTIONED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMIC WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU
2609-156975-0000 WHEN MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN
2609-156975-0001 HOWDORNE HOPHAST HODOUBT PATE SINCE HIS GENIUS
2609-156975-0002 LET'S HAVE FAITH THE RIGHT MATRON MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET'S DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
2609-156975-0003 THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THEIR BONDAGE
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHOSE TURBANT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KIERNAPATH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIANS AND SCRITZINS GIVE OF THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF CONCEALED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ALTAMI CARVETS INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES PROSTRATE TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDAH WERE THE CHIEF FACTORS IN THIS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
2609-156975-0008 THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES ENTIRELY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATION OF THE SOJOURN IN EGYPT
2609-156975-0009 THE LATER TRADITIONS SHOULD EXTEND THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY PATEM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATOM
2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY IN SCRIPT AND ULSER STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHAM THE HOUSE OF RAMESES A CITY WITH THE ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES
2609-156975-0012 THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS SRANNY WAS NATURALLY INEVITABLE
2609-156975-0013 WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE DESPOTIC ROAR OF THAT LAND AND DAY
2609-156975-0014 THE MAKING OF A REAL PATRIOT
2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES'S BIRTH AT EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
2609-156975-0016 WAS MOSES JUST FINDIN RESISTIN THE GYPSIN TACTS MASTER
2609-156975-0017 IS PINIONS ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
2609-156975-0018 NOT'REE HE WENT TO THE LAND OF MIDIAN
2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FUGITIVES
2609-156975-0020 ON ABOUT TWO THOUSAND B C
2609-156975-0021 ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND SEVERAL BEDOUIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
2609-156975-0022 THESE SAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KIDUM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME AT THE TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0024 THE SCORE OF THE WEALTHINESS
2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUITE
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIESTS OF THE SUB TRIBE OF THE CANNITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0027 NOTE THAT CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL TO HIS TRAINING AS THE LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT UP WITH THE WESTERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KINITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YALWAY OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GUIDE WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0031 DO THE EARLIEST HEBREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0032 THE TITLE OF THIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0033 MOSES THE HOME OF THE MIDIAN PRIESTS WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0034 THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE OF EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
2609-156975-0035 HIS QUEST WAS FOR AJUTS AND STRONG GOWN ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENS HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON THE POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MAN
2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST AND TONIAN PLAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA MINOR SIRIL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVING SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
2609-156975-0038 THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES'S CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWERS OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTION
2609-157645-0000 EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PLEASANT FOR THEIR ROYAL FOE OF TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
2609-157645-0001 THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGUING QUOD AT A SMOAKEN IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
2609-157645-0002 SOMETIMES TOBACCO IS USED IN CHURCH FOR DISINFECTANT OR DEORDINIZING PURPOSES
2609-157645-0003 BLACKBURN ART'S BISPE OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER
2609-157645-0004 ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH LININGHAM FOR A CONFIRMED MASON
2609-157645-0005 ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER SIDNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTRY AT HATTON
2609-157645-0006 PAR WAS SUCH A CONTINUOUS SMOKER THAT ANY ONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HADN'T NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENCE
2609-157645-0007 ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITSFIELD HE HANDED MASTER PIPE AND CHILDER THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING EM PATIENT
2609-157645-0008 THEM MEN SING ANOTHER PSALM SAID THE CURATE
2609-157645-0009 THEY HAD SIR REPLIED THE CLERK
2609-157645-0010 THEN LET THEM SING THAT HUNDRED AND NINETEENTH REPLIED THE CURATE
2609-157645-0011 SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AND AS MANY TOBACCO PIPES TO THE MEN OF OFFICE
2609-157645-0012 DAVID DEANE SAVOR THEN NOT AT ALL PROVED THIS IRREVERENCE
2609-157645-0013 GOING TO CHURCH SAINT HALE'S IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN A QUAINT ON A SIGNING EXPERIENCE
2609-157645-0014 WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND OUT HE WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
2609-169640-0000 PARROTS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY THE SKEPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE SEEST FOUR OF THEM FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE
2609-169640-0001 AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO AN LIGHT AIR THAT JUST KEPT THE STEERAGE WAY ON THE SHIP
2609-169640-0002 FORTUNATELY THE MAN WAS NOT ONLY FAT BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS THE LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS IN UNLIVELY DANCE
2609-169640-0003 I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SIP POT HE SPECTS EE IN MODERATE WEATHER
2609-169640-0004 MISTER MARVEL HE I DO B'LIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HINCOOPS BEING LIKE THE SAILORS AS ONE MIGHT SAY FERRY ASLEEP
2609-169640-0005 AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE THEN FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN THE BOAT
2609-169640-0006 I SING AT SAIL HO AND CLOSE ABOARD
2609-169640-0007 HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEA MAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
2609-169640-0008 ALTHOUGH IT WENT THREE FEET TO OUR TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
2609-169640-0009 AS OUR SEATS WERE OFTEN LYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT
2609-169640-0010 I SOON SAW BOTH PRANTS AND GLAD ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER
2609-169640-0011 MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS HOWEVER AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCALS ABACK
2609-169640-0012 A PRIMITIVE STILLNESS SUCCEEDED
2609-169640-0013 THE PROTES DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED AS FAST
2609-169640-0014 I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING PITS TOO AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
2609-169640-0015 KITE WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
2609-169640-0016 THE STILLNESS THAT ENSUED ON BOTH SIDES WAS LIKE THAT OF DEATH
2609-169640-0017 THE GUIDE BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME ROUND LIKE A TAR
2609-169640-0018 THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER WE CAN PASS THEM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
2609-169640-0019 THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INSTANT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE IN THE CLOSEST ATTENTION TO HIS ORDERS
2609-169640-0020 NOT A SOUL ON BOARD THE JACK WAS HURT
2609-169640-0021 ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMEN THE FOUR SIXES TWO ON THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERNMOST PROWA WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
2609-169640-0022 THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN ANGUISHES
2609-169640-0023 I DOUBT IF WE'D TOUCH THE MAN IN THE NEAREST RIVER
2609-169640-0024 IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD OF HER CANVASS BINNED FORE LEAVING THE PROWER MOSCENOUS IN HER WAKE
3005-163389-0000 THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHERBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK FOR THE NOISE
3005-163389-0001 SOME ONE SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEAR DOWN THE FENCE
3005-163389-0002 THE STILLNESS IS AWFUL CREEPY AND UNCOMFORTABLE
3005-163389-0003 SHERBURN RUN HIS EYES SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUTGAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
3005-163389-0004 THE AVERAGE WOMAN'S A COWARD
3005-163389-0005 BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE MEN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARK AND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
3005-163389-0006 SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH ONE HUNDRED MASKED COWARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
3005-163389-0007 YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO
3005-163389-0008 BUT A MOB WITHOUT ANY MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT IS BENEATH POSITIVENESS
3005-163389-0009 NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN UP CROSS HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS THIS
3005-163389-0010 THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AND THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AND BUCK HARKNESS HE HEALED IT AFTER THEM LOOKED INTOLERABLE CHEAP
3005-163389-0011 SHE CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
3005-163389-0012 THEY ARGUED AND TRIED TO KEEP HIM OUT BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE WHOLE SHOW COME INTO A STANDSTILL
3005-163389-0013 AND ONE OR TWO MEN BEGAN TO SCREAM
3005-163389-0014 SO THE RING MASTER HE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSE
3005-163389-0015 IT ISN'T FUNNY TO ME THOUGH I WAS ALL OF A TREMBLE TO SEE HIS DANGER
3005-163389-0016 AND THE HORSE IS GOING LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE TOO
3005-163389-0017 HE SHED EM SO THICK THEY KIND OF CLOGGED UP THE AIR AND ALSO HE SHED SEVENTEEN SUITS
3005-163389-0018 WHY THAT WAS ONE OF HIS OWN MEN
3005-163390-0000 AND BUT NEVER MIND THE REST OF HIS OUTFIT IT WAS JES WILD BUT IT WAS AWFUL FUNNY
3005-163390-0001 THE PEOPLE MOST KILLED THEMSELVES LAUGHING AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE CAPERIN AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HAWED TILL HE COME BACK AND DONE IT OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM DO IT ANOTHER TIME

3005-163399-0015 SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I'VE GOT TO REST THE TRUTH
3005-163399-0016 I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND A BED AND SAYS HERE HE COMES
3005-163399-0017 CHILDREN DON'T YE SAY A WORD

3005-163399-0021 I CAN'T IMAGINE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MAKES ME A DREADFUL UNEASY
3005-163399-0022 UNEASY SHE SAYS I'M READY TO BE DISTRACTED
3005-163399-0023 HE MUST HA COME AN YO'VE MISSED HIM ALONG DE ROAD
3005-163399-0024 AH DON'T DISTRESS ME ANY MORE'N I'M ALREADY DISTRESSED
3005-163399-0025 OH SILAS LOOK YONDER UP THE ROAD AIN'T THAT SOMEBODY COMING
3005-163399-0026 THE OLD WOMAN STARED AND SAYS
3005-163399-0027 I HAIN'T NO IDEA WHICH IS IT
3005-163399-0028 HIS TOM SAWYER
3005-163399-0029 BING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AN IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
3005-163399-0030 AND I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES DOWN ON THAT BOAT
3080-5032-0000 FOR I AM HUGELY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MY LADY
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU I HAVE SEEN BUT THE WORST OF HER
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUMOUR AND DISPOSITION COULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
3080-5032-0003 WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND HER GARLAND
3080-5032-0004 WELL THE BEST ON' IT IS THAT I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS THE STRANGEST
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITHAL AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAVE FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT THAT I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
3080-5032-0008 TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNEW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS THE SQUIRE OF DANE'S AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND TO SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0010 I SEE MY YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH HIM
3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUT THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I THINK YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT HE MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOUR BITS AND HAVE HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0014 BUT BESIDES I CAN GET YOU OTHERS
3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WILL LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0016 YOU WILL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY KEEP IT
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMORS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBOURS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONE'SELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU YOU SHALL HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU SHOULD
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I'M CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE BUT NEVER MORE CALMLY
3080-5032-0024 AND THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARNED IT SINCE
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM CHEAP MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETERS
3080-5032-0026 HOW KINDLY I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHER'S IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
3080-5040-0000 WOULD THAT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER IN HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD YOU ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMASH
3080-5040-0003 I WONDER HOW HE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE HIM BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIGHT IN A PUBLIC WEDDING TO BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WILL ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE WAS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTERS TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
3080-5040-0008 MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGOAN THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED
3080-5040-0009 YOU SEE I GIVE YE FAIR WARNING
3080-5040-0010 BY THE NEXT I SHOULD BE GONE INTO KENT AND MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR INTERCOURSE VERY MUCH

3080-5040-0016 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVED ME
3080-5040-0017 FOR I AM CALLED UPON
3080-5040-0018 DIRECTED FROM YOUR MASTER
3080-5040-0019 I KNOW YOU CAN CHID WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS THAN IN THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING IT
3080-5040-0021 YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE IN THIS THAT I ESCAPED DROWNING
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WROTE BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0023 HOW WELCOME YE WILL BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0024 FROM MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGHED TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR HAPPINESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS WHEN WE HAVE THE TIME
3080-5040-0027 WHILE IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE HIM AGAIN
3080-5040-0028 WELL YOU BE SO GOOD NATURED
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND HE IS THE FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THUS WITH DISCOURSES OF MY FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER OCCASION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OF AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO HEAR WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASE CART WITH NINE PEAS IN IT NEAR MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PA INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
3331-159605-0001 THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MORE
3331-159605-0002 I'VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAY BE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME I SAY YES
3331-159605-0004 WHAT A SPITEABLE THING I AM
3331-159605-0005 I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME THAT I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 LET ME SEE WHAT CAN I BEGIN
3331-159605-0007 HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HIM
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOUR OF ROMANCE IN HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THIS DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT IS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHEWN TO EVERYONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARD POLLY AND IT FLATTERED HER MORE THAN SHE COULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN CREDIT
3331-159605-0014 POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SIDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF A LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPITE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BUCKY AND BESS BUT COULD NOT RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FAN THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DAUGHTER BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASSA CHARLIE'S HAND MISS MAMMY AN WALK PRETTY LIKE BILLY AND FLOSSIE SAID THE MAID
3331-159605-0019 AT THE STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOLBOY WAS PARTING FROM THE ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT HERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO UNPLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE ROAS ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FAINTNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU SHE DOESN'T IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0025 THINK YOU NO
3331-159605-0026 HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS HE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0027 ASK THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS WERE RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
3331-159605-0029 SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BUOYANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WIFE LIKE LEVERLY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVOURITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT THIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 WORKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL BUT THAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS SHE'S CHILLED HIM
3331-159605-0035 UTTERLY DONE FOR AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE POTTLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBERS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED BILLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS NOT HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0038 DON'T YE THINK HE MEANS TO
3331-159605-0039 TRULY TRULY FANN
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE HAD
3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAD
3331-159605-0042 I JUST GAVE THEM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THEN THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN AND MIND WHAT SIDDY TATTLERS SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHANDELMAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT POLLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0046 I'M HONEST YOU KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE REST TO WHITEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 UNFORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HIS VACATIONS CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THEIR LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL ALL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NOW I'M ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I WISH NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0008 AND THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
3331-159609-0009 EXCLAIMED POLLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0010 SIR POLLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELL TALE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHIONS LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKINGLY THEN I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT WERE SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BEFORE
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER AND ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATED THEIR RESPECTIVE VERUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSS THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS WHAT HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID HARRY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRIES AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO POOR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINTER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE BOYS
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARDS MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE A HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING IN A BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORES
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THE WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON THEM ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORKBASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY CAN TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
3528-168656-0000 SHE HAD NEVER BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN THESE NAMES AT EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR THAT SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUCEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUCEBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOLGIRL WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS TRYING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE TO HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF FOUTREVAL DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0006 SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HIS OBJECT TO ANY ONE
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THEIR CONVENT
3528-168656-0008 AN UNIQUE CHAPLET SOME AUTHENTIC RELIC
3528-168656-0009 THEY LOST THEMSELVES BY CONJECTURES
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED INTO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT A DANCER IS LAUGHING WITH A SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0012 MORAL LOVE CONQUERED BY THE COLLEGE
3528-168669-0000 THE PRIORESS REPLIED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HER CHAIR
3528-168669-0001 WE WOULD PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0002 FATHER FALIENT
3528-168669-0003 REVERED MOTHER DO YOU KNOW THE CHAPEL
3528-168669-0004 THEN YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
3528-168669-0005 THERE IS A STONE TO BE PLACED HEAVY
3528-168669-0006 THE SLAP OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH WAS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0007 THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES A VAULT YES
3528-168669-0008 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN TO IT
3528-168669-0009 A WOMAN NEVER A MAN
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DAM BABYLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLONUS HORSEES ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERLINUS HORSES NEITHER DO I
3528-168669-0011 MERIT CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH THE CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCKYARD
3528-168669-0012 AND THE WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0013 AND CAN WE GET A LEVER
3528-168669-0014 THERE IS A RING IN THE STONES
3528-168669-0015 I'LL PUT THE LEVER THROUGH IT
3528-168669-0016 THIS IS GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I WILL OPEN THE VAULT

3528-168669-0020 I AM HERE TO DO SOMETHING YOU WISH

3528-168669-0022 WHEN THIS VAULT IS OPEN I WILL CLOSE IT AGAIN
3528-168669-0023 BUT BEFORE THAT WHAT REVEREND FATHER

3528-168669-0027 NOTHING CAN BE HEARD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER REALLY
3528-168669-0028 AND NOW THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN MY DIRECTION THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0029 IT WAS NOTHING CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN HIM CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER AH
3528-168669-0031 THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNEW
3528-168669-0032 A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEAD WOMAN MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0033 HELL MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0034 WHAT D YOU SAY

3528-168669-0043 FATHER VAUVIN THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0044 SHE RETAINS HER CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT
3528-168669-0045 SHE GAVE YOU HER LAST COMMANDS
3528-168669-0046 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HER WAY SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0047 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF PARIS IN THAT DEATH
3528-168669-0048 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORISON WHICH SHE WAS FURNISHING
3528-168669-0049 FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE SHE WENT IN
3528-168669-0050 I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABORING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THAT CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT
3528-168669-0051 FORTUNATELY THE PRIMESS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT

3528-168669-0069 WE ASKED IT OF US THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDED US
3528-168669-0070 THAT IT IS FORBIDDEN

3528-168669-0130 I WILL TAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ESSENCES AND DESSERT DISHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR IF THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WOULD SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH US PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THAT IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OUT AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKING UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THAT SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN SEVENTY NINE
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM ABOUT THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER IN WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM HIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN A STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE RETURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS WERE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMS AND ROOT PASTE ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THERE WERE PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 AND THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE AND THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFERCET TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES WHICH ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER AND THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE ALSO EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES OR STEMS
3538-142836-0023 HASIS
3538-142836-0024 AT DESSERTS OR IN SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THAT SPATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE ON THAT TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE OR WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS MY GIRL SAID THE HEAD
3538-163619-0004 AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND WOULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH OF THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LANDS
3538-163619-0007 IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY WIFE SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO SEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE PICKED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY DAUGHTER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED AND AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET THE QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOES ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOLDS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN A LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE CHIEF
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WILL HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS FATHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING A DISTIFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME HITHER COME THITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCKS BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVE LONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SYB THE LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDERS SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID TINDER LAD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID SINDERLAD
3538-163622-0014 AND THIS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOLE AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID TINDER LAD
3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKS LIKE THE TONGUE OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SINDERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY CHOLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DIDST THOU SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE FELLOW SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FOE DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS A RIVER SAYS THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDER LADS
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARRIORS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT OFF AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MAY BE HEALED
3538-163624-0003 SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING THROUGH THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE WAS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THIS TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THIS WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO EGAN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO EGAN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGURD SAID THAT WORDS WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED AWAY AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PITCH AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY RAISING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM ITS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FAFFNER AND THEN STUFFNER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFFIER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO SIGURD PUT THE PART OF FAFNER ON A STEAK AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THEN IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HERNFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP UNTIL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPERS AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 LIN BENHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUNDRAN WERE BATHING BRUNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRED'S SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME AND NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE WHEN I AM DEAD
367-130732-0000 AND LOBSTERS AND LOBSTERS
367-130732-0001 WHY IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION AN ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMARY OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BEST BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN
367-130732-0004 A BOOK CAN BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD WIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER ALE NIEBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DOMONICO
367-130732-0006 LOBSTER ELLEN NEWBEG
367-130732-0007 ONE POUND OF LOBSTER MEAT ONE TEASPOONFUL OF BUTTER ONE HALF PINT OF CREAM YOLKS OF FOUR EGGS ONE WINE GLASSFUL OF SHERRY LOBSTER FAT

367-130732-0009 SERVE IN A CHAFING DISH WITH THIN SLICES OF TOAST
367-130732-0010 MEN OF SHELLFISH
367-130732-0011 ONE HAS TO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO TO PARTAKE OF THE KING OF SHELLFISH THAT MAMMOTH PACIFIC CRAB
367-130732-0012 I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COAST IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUS AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
367-130732-0013 GOBY'S PASSED WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW ON UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBIES AS BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PRESTIGE DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
367-130732-0015 GABY'S CRAB STEW
367-130732-0016 TAKE THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT ALL OF THE FAT FROM THE SHELL
367-130732-0017 SOAK THEIR CRAB MEAT IN THE SHERRY TWO HOURS BEFORE COOKING
367-130732-0018 CHOP FINE THE ONION SWEET AND TOMATO WITH THE ROSEMARY

367-130732-0020 SERVE IN A CHAFING DISH WITH TOASTED CRACKERS THIN SLICES OF TOASTED BREAD
367-130732-0021 LOBSTER ON MINIATURE
367-130732-0022 SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE HOFF BROW HAS BEEN MAKING A SPECIALITY OF THEM
367-130732-0023 ALL THE BETTER CLASS RESTAURANTS HOWEVER WILL SERVE EM IF YOU ORDER THEM
367-130732-0024 THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR EIGHTEEN PEOPLE AND IT IS WELL WORTH TRYING IF YOU ARE GIVING A DINNER OF IMPORTANCE

367-130732-0026 TAKE THIRTY CRAWFISH OF WHICH REMOVE THE GUT CONTAINING THE GALL IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TAKE FIRM HOLD OF THE CRAWFISH WITH THE LEFT HAND SO AS TO AVOID BEING PINCHED BY ITS CLAWS WITH THE THUMB AND FOREFINGER OF THE RIGHT HAND PINCH THE EXTREME END OF THE CENTRAL FIN OF THE TAIL AND WITH A SUDDEN JERK THE GUT WILL BE WITHDRAWN
367-130732-0027 MINCE OR CUT INTO SMALL DICE CARROT AN ONION ONE HEAD OF CELERY AND A FEW PARSLEY ROOTS AND TO THESE ADD A BAY LEAF A SPRIG OF THYME A LITTLE MIGNONETTE PEPPER AND TWO OUNCES OF BUTTER

367-130732-0029 ALLOW THIS TO BOIL AND THEN ADD A QUART OF STRONG CONSIUM AND LET ALL CONTINUE BOILING FOR HALF AN HOUR
367-130732-0030 PICK OFF THE CRAWFISH AND STRAIN THE BROTH THROUGH A NAPKIN BY PRESSURE INTO A BASIN IN ORDER TO EXTRACT ALL THE ESSENCE FROM THE VEGETABLES
367-130732-0031 PICK THE SHELLS OFF TWENTY FIVE OF THE CRAYFISH TAILS TRIM THEM NEATLY AND SET THEM ASIDE UNTIL WANTED
367-130732-0032 RESERVE SOME OF THE SPAWN ALSO HALF OF THE BODY CELLS WITH WHICH TO MAKE THE CRAWFISH BUTTER TO FINISH THE SOUP
367-130732-0033 THIS BUTTER IS MADE AS FOLLOWS PLACE THE SHELLS ON THE BAKING SHEET IN THE OVEN TO DRY LET THE SHELLS COOL AND THEN POUND THEM IN A MORTAR WITH A LITTLE LOBSTER CORAL AND FOUR OUNCES OF FRESH BUTTER THOROUGHLY BRUISING THE WHOLE TOGETHER SO AS TO MAKE A FINE PASTE

367-293981-0011 TO BE BRIEF HE TOOK THE MATERIALS OF WHICH HE MADE A COMPOUND MIXING THEM ALL AND BOILING THEM A GOOD WHILE AT UNTIL IT SEEMED TO HIM THEY HAD COME TO PERFECTION
367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE PESKIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED IT DOWN AND DRAINED A VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER
367-293981-0014 IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT RETURNED SANCHO WOE BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KIND WHY DID YOU LET ME TASTE IT
367-293981-0015 SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THIS KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU BY THE ORDER OF THE KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOU SATISFACTION AND REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRE
367-293981-0016 THAT THIS IS AN INN SAID DON QUIXOTE
367-293981-0017 AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE SAYS THE INNKEEPER
367-293981-0018 THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLANKETED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW VISITOR WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS SQUIRE WHO UTTERED THEM
367-293981-0019 HE SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAG ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
367-293981-0020 SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THE BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT SURELY BE RESTORED
3764-168670-0000 THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MEN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
3764-168670-0001 COSETTE HAD WAKED
3764-168670-0002 JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED HER NEAR THAT FIRE
3764-168670-0003 YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE I SHOULD COME TO FETCH YOU
3764-168670-0004 EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENTS
3764-168670-0005 I HAVE PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST HAVE GOT OUT
3764-168670-0006 THAT'S WHERE A DIFFICULTY LIES
3764-168670-0007 IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THE CHILD YOU WILL CARRY HER OFF
3764-168670-0008 THEN SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE I ANSWER FOR THAT
3764-168670-0009 FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN VALJEAN AND
3764-168670-0010 YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT NOTICE IT
3764-168670-0011 JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS RAVEN
3764-168670-0012 THEN FAUCHELEVENT WENT ON
3764-168670-0013 IT IS TO MORROW THAT I HAVE TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECTS YOU
3764-168670-0014 THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR A SERVICE WHICH SHE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE COMMUNITY
3764-168670-0015 THAT A NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
3764-168670-0016 THAT THE PRIORESS AND THE VOCAL MOTHERS INTENDED TO FULFIL THE WISHES OF THE DECEASED
3764-168670-0017 THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THIS CELL RAISE THE STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
3764-168670-0018 AND THEN IT THERE WAS ANOTHER THE EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0019 WHICH IS THAT EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0020 ASKED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENTILY
3764-168670-0021 WHAT COFFIN OR WHAT ADMINISTRATION
3764-168670-0022 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER HIS HAIR YOU
3764-168670-0023 YOU KNOW FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAYS MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IS DEAD
3764-168670-0024 AND I ADD AND FATHER MADELEINE IS MARRIED R
3764-168670-0025 YOU'RE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN FATHER MADELEINE
3764-168670-0026 THIS OFFERS THIS MEANS GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
3764-168670-0027 HOW LONG IS THE COMMON SIX FEET
3764-168670-0028 IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER TO THE CHURCH WHAT CHURCH
3764-168670-0029 THE CHURCH IN THE STREET OF THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
3764-168670-0030 HAVE YOU THE KEYS TO TWO DOORS
3764-168670-0031 N NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKERS MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET A COFFIN
3764-168670-0033 WHO NAILS UP THE COFFIN I MEAN
3764-168670-0034 WHO SPREADS THE PAWN OVER IT
3764-168670-0035 NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN UPON THE WALL
3764-168670-0036 COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THE ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN EVERY ONE IS ASLEEP
3764-168670-0037 ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3764-168670-0038 I SHALL BE HUNGRY I SHALL BRING YOU SOMETHING
3764-168670-0039 YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP IN THE CONVENT AT TWO O'CLOCK
3764-168670-0040 FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND COCKED HIS FINGER JOINTS BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
3764-168670-0041 BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS IN THE PLANK
3764-168670-0042 JEAN JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS THAN THIS
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A VISITOR UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
3764-168670-0044 WHAT DOES THE MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A CURE
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THAT WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE ROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANKON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0047 A MAN WHO IS MAKING THIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE
3764-168670-0048 WHO IS THERE WHO HAD NOT SAID TO A CAT DO COME IN
3764-168670-0049 THE OVERPREDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
3764-168670-0050 THEN JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
3764-168670-0052 THE OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0053 I SHALL FIND THAT IS MY BUSINESS
3764-168670-0054 THE HOUSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN KNOT A ROPE ROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0055 THE PRIEST SAYS THE PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGNS OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR WILL NOT BE SOBER
3764-168670-0057 IT IS SETTLED FATHER FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL GO WELL
3764-168671-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAINS PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEETH
3764-168671-0001 THIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK COVER LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
3764-168671-0002 A MORNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN THE PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
3764-168671-0003 BEHIND CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABORER WHO LIMPED ALONG
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING AND SUMMER AND AT NIGHT AND WINTER IN THE CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEYOND THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES
3764-168671-0006 DAMPNESS WERE INVADING IT THE FLOWERS WERE DESERTING IT
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VOUGERAGE IT HINTED AT POVERTY PER LA CHAISE IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHET IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0009 THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN INTO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENAL OFFENCE IN OUR SIDE
3764-168671-0010 THAT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE A DUTY
3764-168671-0011 THE NUNS HAD COMMITTED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE
3764-168671-0012 IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY THE INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0013 MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MEN AND KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES
3764-168671-0014 A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PRINCIPLE
3764-168671-0015 FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE IN VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0016 JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE IS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0017 WHATEVER REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESSION
3764-168671-0019 HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM STAND ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
3764-168671-0020 THIS PERMISSION FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF LABOURING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRYING A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0022 THE MAN RETURNED THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0023 THE GRAVE DIGGER PERHAPS
3764-168671-0024 YOU I I
3764-168671-0025 FATHER MES TIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
3764-168671-0026 FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THAT BUT A GRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE
3764-168671-0027 IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIGGERS DID DIE THEMSELVES
3764-168671-0028 HE HAVE HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STAMMER
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER MASSIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LENOIR IS HERE'S THE JUG OF RED WINE
3764-168671-0031 BUT YOU' ARE A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
3764-168671-0032 ARE YOU MY COMRADE WE'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
3764-168671-0033 THE MAN CRIED
3764-168671-0034 HE LIMPED MORE OUT OF NECESSITY THAN FROM INFIRMITY
3764-168671-0035 THE GRAVE DIGGER WALKING ON IN FRONT OF HIM
3764-168671-0036 FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED CRELIER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A HORRIBLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER HE MUTTERED
3764-168671-0038 BECAUSE FATHER MATHIER IS DEAD
3764-168671-0039 THE MAN REPLIED IMMEDIATELY
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTEBOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MESCHIENNE'S TURN FATHER MESTHIERNE DIED
3764-168671-0041 STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT IT IS MAD
3764-168671-0042 YOU HAVE A PEASANT I AM A PARISIAN
3764-168671-0043 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT I M LOST
3764-168671-0044 THEY WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUN'S CORNER
3764-168671-0045 THEN HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED THEIR SPEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE BRITANNIA TOWN HALL
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES UPON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0049 BUT YOU ARE NOT A GRAVE DIGGER THEN
3764-168671-0050 RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING ON THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS
3764-168671-0051 HERE OUR REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY
3764-168671-0052 A FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053 THE GRAVEDIGGERS WENT ON WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE
3764-168671-0054 ONE MUST ACT
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING AND WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR WHAT
3997-180294-0002 WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS LOVED YOU
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR RICH
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEM TO ME AS IF I DO
3997-180294-0005 NOW LOOK I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT THINKING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COURSE OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEEING HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THE BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VEIL
3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HAVE BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELING
3997-180294-0011 THEY LOVE BY REFLECTION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0012 WHEN THE CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0013 YOU KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF TO GIVE
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABOURERS IN THAT FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0015 THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LIKE SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH OF SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAISAN
3997-180294-0018 WHEN WE REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAIETY
3997-180294-0019 A WOMAN BECOMES A MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 HOW WHERE
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXULTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT THE VAUDEVILLES
3997-180294-0023 COME DURING THE THIRD INTRACT
3997-180294-0024 THE GLASSES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY THE STATE BOX
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX IN WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0027 DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO DAY SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 YOU COULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0030 THERE AT HOME
3997-180294-0031 YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASKED
3997-180294-0032 IF YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
3997-180294-0033 NONE THE LESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARQUIS GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0000 I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARADISE
3997-180297-0001 YOU HAVE IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A ROOM HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE
3997-180297-0003 DURING HIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY
3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR PRUDENCE ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GET AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION WOULD DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
3997-180297-0007 HAS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
3997-180297-0008 IF IT WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
3997-180297-0009 HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR IT A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
3997-180297-0010 I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON SEEING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0011 AH GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
3997-180297-0012 I ANSWERED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELLOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF A MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
3997-180297-0014 TRULY HE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRES AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOARDED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 WE NO LONGER BELONG OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017 WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEM NEXT IN THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER DO WE GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES AND A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND IN OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0021 I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH HE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVED AND UNDERSTOOD WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT OUT HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0024 MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG AND IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
3997-180297-0025 MAGGIE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID
3997-180297-0026 HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT HIM BACK
3997-180297-0027 I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND WHICH GAVE IT TO ME
3997-180297-0028 LOOK HERE PRUDENCE DO YE KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID MARGUERITE
3997-180297-0029 AND HE WANTS YOU TO FORGIVE HIM
3997-180297-0030 ONE IS TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT THEN
3997-180297-0031 I EMBRACED MARGUERITE UNTIL SHE IS ALMOST STIFLED
3997-182399-0000 MISSUS BUZZARD GRINNED
3997-182399-0001 THIS SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER STORM
3997-182399-0002 HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK HANDED COUSIN OF OLD MISTER BUZZARD VERY CURIOUS INDEED
3997-182399-0003 ANYWAY HE WOULD FIND IT

4198-12281-0001 I BESEECH YOU THINK ABOUT IT
4198-12281-0002 NEVERTHELESS AT ALL VENTURES THEY RANG THE BELLS AD CAPITULUM CAPITULANTIS
4198-12281-0003 BY THE VIRTUE OF GOD WHY DO NOT YOU SING PANNIERS FAREWELL VINTAGE AS DONE
4198-12281-0004 BY THE BELLY OF SAINT JAMES WHAT SHALL WE POOR DEVILS DRINK WHILE
4198-12281-0005 LORD GOD DAME HEPOTUM
4198-12281-0006 LET HIM BE CARRIED TO PRISON FOR TROUBLING A DIVINE SERVICE
4198-12281-0007 WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN THE ADVENT AND THE WINTER
4198-12281-0008 HARK YOU MY MASTERS YOU THAT LOVE THE WINE COP'S BODY FOLLOW ME FOR SAINT ANTHONY BURNS ME AS FREELY AS A FAGGOT THEY GET LEAVE TO TASTE ONE DROP OF THE LIQUOR THAT WILL NOT NOW COME AND FIGHT FOR RELIEF OF THE VINE
4198-12281-0009 TO OTHERS AGAIN HE UNJOINTED THE SPINDLES OR KNUCKLES OF THE NECK DISFIGURED THEIR CHAPS GHASHED THEIR FACES MADE THEIR CHEEKS HANG FLAPPING ON THEIR CHIN AND SO SWINGED AND BELAMMED THEM THAT THEY FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM LIKE HAY BEFORE A MORE
4198-12281-0010 TO SOME WITH THEY SMART SOUS ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDRIFTS WAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOME PUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
4198-12281-0011 BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER ONE SAW
4198-12281-0012 O THE HOLY LADY NITIUS SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTUS O OUR LADY OF SUCCOURS SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP
4198-12281-0013 SOME DIED WITHOUT SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE WITHOUT DYING SOME DIED IN SPEAKING OTHERS BROKE IN DYING
4198-12281-0014 CAN YOU TELL BY WHAT INSTRUMENTS THEY DID IT
4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEANWHILE FRIAR JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVORED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHA BY THE ADHERENCE OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 WITH THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SHARDURAS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
4198-61336-0003 TIGLATH PELISER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE EURENTIAN ARMY IN KOOMAC
4198-61336-0004 A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF ITS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING CHARODORUS WHO LEAPT FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST URTA ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0007 THE SIFTI MATTI ILIU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT CHARDDORUS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TIGLATH PALLISER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERN END WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0010 ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATTI IU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE HEROS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA
4198-61336-0012 HIS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 JEHOA THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARDS HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHEM
4198-61336-0015 THIS USURPER HELD SWAY AT SUMARIA FOR ONLY A MONTH
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MAHEIM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0017 TEGLATH POLIZER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTHEAST
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD TO PUT TO THE SWARD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS EURUTU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLATH PILLISER RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0021 MENOHEIM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PEGAHIAH
4198-61336-0022 JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT THEIR INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0023 HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR ITS IDOLATRIES HE CRIED
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YOU ME AND YE SHALL LIVE HAVE YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL
4198-61336-0025 THEIR REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES SHALL PERISH
4198-61336-0026 ISRAEL WERE ALSO DEALT WITH
4198-61336-0027 HE SWEPT TOWARD ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0028 THE PHILISTINES THE ARABIANS OF THE DESERT WERE ALSO SUBDUED
4198-61336-0029 WHO INVADED BABYLONIA
4198-61336-0030 UGENZER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITOLA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0000 AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I OVERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN AND THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO AN ERROR
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME THY LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BENELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR IF HE GOES TO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0005 I ASK NO BETTER REWARD FOR MY LABORS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0006 AND I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS PLEASURE TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0008 I BEGGED THIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM I HAD EVER TAKEN IN
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GEORGIO DEL CORTONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0010 GIORGIA CAME FOR THEM HIS HEALTH
4294-14317-0011 I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME IN DISGRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDINE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LANDI WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGELL
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTOR'S CRAFT
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MAN TO WORK UPON THE PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-14317-0016 AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THEIR NEW SCULPTOR
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS TO THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN HEART I REACHED HOME
4294-32859-0000 WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGINGLY
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS THE PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDOLINE AND RETCH'S PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU MY STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THIS OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED TO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE LITTLE SUN WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED OH ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BROTHERS
4294-35475-0002 AND THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE QUOTH
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN'S SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE WINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRIDA HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE DAY AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST REND ME IN PIECES A MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHOT LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE OGRE CRIED A FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HIDE AND SAVE US FROM THE OGRE'S MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HELP HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THE THOUGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS BURDEN
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS THE KEYHOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING DAY UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS FROM A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CLIMBED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE HE CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THAT POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE TO HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTAWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN COME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIED'S BROTHER THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT ETHELRIED HEEDED NOT THE TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE ISEULT
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WIND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN RESPECT IT ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND FLIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BATLIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE ACQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS IN DOUBT PAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE DID NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE RELATIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS TIMES OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY THEN ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARCHIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOUR SAID COURFEYRAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER GOLD HERE HE IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND SOME BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 THAT'LL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU KNOW GERMANS NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PLAYED WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHES DEALERS WAS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENT THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S
4294-9934-0022 I BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HULLO I'D FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON A SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TWENTY FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT THEY HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON OF THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS CURLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST PETER
4350-10919-0003 WELL YOU DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION THEN DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASED THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE FRIENDLY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND HERE ARE INDICATIONS MALUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATION OF A TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
4350-10919-0009 YES THAT'S THE UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE YUSKI BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED AH IS
4350-10919-0012 OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN THIRTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABROAD ASKED A FAMILY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH OF LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0015 THAT FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING IT REMINISCENCES
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THAT MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THE CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 OH TIME'S UP ALREADY AND WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE HIS PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS MISSUS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE OTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE MASTER CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ANSWERED HIM BUT ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO USE IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THAT CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENSE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS IRRITABLY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAVE FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCE AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 ON THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DISEASE WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEM AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER FATHER AND KATY PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE IN THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-9170-0001 WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WOULD VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTEREST OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THE CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL IMPULSE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS HARDLY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE WAS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTES THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL WAS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN SENATORS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT COULD NEVER BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THEIR SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THAT SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE CAN NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THIS STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONFLICT
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THIS STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NO MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF DEPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TENDS TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST SUMMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITIONS OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 SO IT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS PROPOSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITIONS DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TODAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO FIGHT UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS SUBNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THIS SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ENEMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE OF THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSES
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THESE MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BEEN OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN A MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THESE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED BY THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGERS OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTIONS INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT IT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHANCE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH AM I MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF A STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERY THING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT IN THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER THEN
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT TO THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATES MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY TWO CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NAMES
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES WHO MAY ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THAT STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THIS STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN WAS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THAT WEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF A POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAY YOU KNOW SOMETHIN
4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CARDJACK AND SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 NO WHO NEEDS A JOB MAN THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS
4852-28311-0003 OY HE SAID
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM AND YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT INTO EM STREET
4852-28311-0006 WELL HE ADDED I DID
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED UNDER HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 THINK I REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET A JOB FOR JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH AND CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BITCH AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL THIS TURNED TO HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING IN THE CORNER
4852-28311-0013 WHY SHUCKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THAT BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN TO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARDS THE BACK AT A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON TO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GREEN CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DETERMINED TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS FATHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL I REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY FACES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT A COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTRE THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES ON THE MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO TO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER TELL
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARHORN WOKEN FROM HIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES HE EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE TILL SOME ONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY ROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW ON THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0003 HEAVY AND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0004 MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARDS THE SOURCE OF THE LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLE CHAINS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE KNEES WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0007 RUTH BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0008 CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS FACE CAME BACK TO HIM
4852-28312-0009 OH YES SIR HE SAID
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS HIS JOB
4852-28312-0011 HE'S A SCHOOLMATE O MINE
4852-28312-0012 JAKIE HARRIS'S NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS A JOB
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE BASE WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR FIFTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED IT MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIEG IS GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE APHIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018 THE HOUSE SEEMED OVERLY STILL
4852-28312-0019 THAN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28312-0020 THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE FEW OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHERE IS THE FREEMAN
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKES STACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023 THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER ABOUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMP LIT TREES
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
4852-28312-0027 A COURTYARD WAS SPECIALLY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0028 THE POSTS WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0029 A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLANED COURTYARD
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STATION
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS NO POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28319-0000 BUT LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
4852-28319-0001 HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOESTLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28319-0002 CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF THE TASK
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOTTLE WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHOULD A ALLY DO FIRST
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THAT IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSED I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK
4852-28319-0007 MISTER WORKER WAITED PATIENTLY BEHIND HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0008 THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER RIGGER SAID STAND AT ONCE
4852-28319-0009 THE SENSATION SPREADS FASTER AND FASTER
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGHOUT THE FINAL WORDS
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT THUS BY
4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ONE A RETURN
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE THAT CURVED UP POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0014 THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO RUTH
4852-28319-0015 IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN CAN HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0017 BUT HOW DID THAT CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
4852-28319-0018 CHRIS GOT OUT AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY IT RESUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOOR OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON RAINS BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM
4852-28319-0021 DUST CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE THIS TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY
4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED TO THE PROPER TIME
4852-28319-0023 MISTER WALKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKY AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCION FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION SMITH CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
4852-28319-0025 IT IS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES THE WIDER FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE LARGE BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED LET THE BOUQUET FALL
4852-28330-0000 THEY WENT DOWN INTO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THE WAY AT ALL
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ALBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW HOW I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
4852-28330-0004 THIS MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHITI
4852-28330-0005 WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON IT
4852-28330-0006 CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING LOST IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0007 CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY COOL AND PENETRATING
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINNI WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO NOT DO AS AN ANSWER HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT IT FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
4852-28330-0011 HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO
4852-28330-0012 YOUR SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY
4852-28330-0013 HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIST STANDING BEFORE HIM
4852-28330-0014 I SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE
4852-28330-0015 THIS SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HAND
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY TO SIR
4852-28330-0017 DOCTOR BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN ITS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0018 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE TREE WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0019 CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT THE WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0020 WHAT MAY BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS OUGHT TO ASK
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND A CREW KNOW IT
4852-28330-0022 I SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE LEFT MISTER WORKER HAD CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE KEPT UP AND SATISFACTIONILY ACCOUNTED FOR
4852-28330-0025 THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE TIME
533-1066-0000 WHEN CHURCHYARDS YA
533-1066-0001 I KNOW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
533-1066-0002 I'M SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD DREADFUL MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
533-1066-0003 FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALLS IN THE LODGE
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THE DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0005 MISSUS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TO NIGHT
533-1066-0006 I HAVE NONE I SAID LAUGHING
533-1066-0007 I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL
533-1066-0008 THE MOST USUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT
533-1066-0009 SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCCUR I SAID
533-1066-0010 PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MADE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
533-1066-0011 LIDBY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
533-1066-0012 THEY WERE TALKING COPULENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
533-1066-0013 THERE WERE FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINDERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0014 I SAID NO QUESTIONS
533-1066-0015 ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FOR DOCTOR STUART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE
533-1066-0016 I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I REPLIED
533-1066-0017 THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOFTLY WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT
533-1066-0018 I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THIS MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A CHEERFUL SPOT
533-1066-0019 IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN DEEPLY
533-1066-0020 IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLE SPADES
533-1066-0021 THE DOCTOR KEPT A LOOKOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED
533-1066-0022 HERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY
533-1066-0023 A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT CARRYING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING THEM UP
533-1066-0024 I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY BUT SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN
533-131556-0000 BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY DO
533-131556-0001 FOR NONE WOULD ENDURE ME AS HE HAS DONE OH
533-131556-0002 THE WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY COMPASSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THAT GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
533-131556-0004 AND I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD THEM SO MINUTELY
533-131556-0005 THEY HAD TAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECIATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK
533-131556-0006 I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY GREAT FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT
533-131556-0007 UPON PERUSING THIS SHE TURN SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP
533-131556-0008 YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND WE'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT
533-131556-0009 ULL OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE
533-131556-0010 UH YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS
533-131556-0011 IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I WOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE
533-131556-0012 I ENJOY A MOONLIGHT RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND SHRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESORTS
533-131556-0013 SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGERS AGAINST HER CHEEKS AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
533-131556-0014 I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH THE FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
533-131556-0015 OH YES YES
533-131556-0016 BECAUSE I DO
533-131556-0017 SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT
533-131556-0018 I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE ANSWERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
533-131556-0019 IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL RATHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR ADMEPTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
533-131556-0020 I SHALL NOT TELL HER
533-131556-0021 GIVE ME NO THANKS IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I SWEAR
533-131556-0022 BUT MILICENT WILL YOU TELL HER
533-131556-0023 I WOULD NOT FOR MUCH SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF HER RELATION
533-131556-0024 YOU USE WORDS MISSUS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU
533-131556-0025 HOW DARE YE MENTION HIS NAME TO ME
533-131562-0000 IT SEEMS VERY INTERESTING LOVE SAID HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO WHERE I STOOD WRINGING MY HANDS IN SILENT RAGE AND ANGUISH BUT IT'S RATHER LONG I LL LOOK AT IT SOME OTHER TIME AND MEANWHILE I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KISS MY DEAR WHAT KISS

533-131562-0002 THE KEY OF MY VEST IN FACT WAS AT THE MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
533-131562-0003 NOW THEN SNEERED HE I MUST HAVE A CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY
533-131562-0004 AND PUTTING THE KEYS INTO HIS POCKETS HE WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY
533-131562-0005 THAT AND ALL SAID THE MASTER AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
533-131562-0006 MISTER HUNTINGDON THEN WENT UPSTAIRS STAIRS
533-131562-0007 MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE'S THE VERY DEVIL FOR SPITE
533-131562-0008 I DON'T SAY I'D BROKEN IT DID I RETURNED HE

533-131562-0010 AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREEBS MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO UP AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN
533-131562-0011 WHAT GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE YOU MADE THEN MISTER HUNTINGDON
533-131562-0012 HAD I TENDED TO DEFRAUD YOU
533-131562-0013 NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS BUT ITS BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
533-131562-0014 HERE BENSON ENTERED THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE I SILENTLY TRIUMPHING IN MY DESPAIR
533-131562-0015 I KNOW THAT DAY AFTER DAY SUCH THINGS WILL RETURN UPON ME
533-131562-0016 I TRY TO GO TO HIM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT IT WILL CLEAVE TO THE DUST
533-131564-0000 VAIN HOPE AND FEAR
533-131564-0001 MISTER AND MISSUS HATTERSLEY HAVE BEEN STAYING AT GROVE A FORTNIGHT AND AS MISSUS HARGRAVE IS STILL ABSENT AND THE WEATHER WAS REMARKABLY FINE I NEVER PASSED THE DAY WITHOUT SEEING MY TWO FRIENDS MILICENT AND ESTHER EITHER THERE OR HERE
533-131564-0002 NO UNLESS YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT ME HOME
533-131564-0003 I CAN'T YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO DO YOU
533-131564-0004 IT IS A RESOLUTION WE HAVE FORMED LONG AGO
533-131564-0005 WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF A LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS THOUGH WE CANT RESPECT HIM

533-131564-0018 THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMSBY AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENUOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON OTHER MAN'S SHOULDERS

533-131564-0027 AFTER THAT THEY WILL REPAIR TO THEIR COUNTRY
5442-32873-0000 CAPTAIN LAKE DOES NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE A LONDON DANDIE NOW
5442-32873-0001 THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND A WILD LUSTRE IN HIS YELLOW EYES RACHEL SAT DOWN
5442-32873-0002 A SLAVE I ONLY THINK A SLAVE
5442-32873-0003 OH FRIGHTFUL IS IT A DREAM
5442-32873-0004 OH FRIGHTFUL TRIFLING
5442-32873-0005 STANLEY STANLEY IT WOULD BE MERCY TO KILL ME SHE BROKE HIM AGAIN
5442-32873-0006 BRIGHT AND GNATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON ITS PERCH WITH A BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF A SAGE HER PILLOW SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
5442-32873-0007 WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TORMOT BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
5442-32873-0008 THERE WAS NOTHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HIS PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE PROCESS
5442-32873-0009 THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SAT DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM
5442-32873-0010 AND SHE THRUST BACK HER VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS
5442-32873-0011 RACHEL LEAK RACHAEL LAKE WHAT ARE YOU NOW
5442-32873-0012 I'LL STAY HERE THAT IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM HE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-32873-0013 HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THE MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGERT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0014 LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKINS'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WILDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOLL CART FOR MIKE BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOLL CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
5442-32873-0015 BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LINE WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARD THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGDON
5442-32873-0016 HERE WERE THE FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELLED DEEP IN THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
5442-32873-0017 LOSE NO TIME AND I'LL GIVE YOU HALF THE CRUMB
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STUCK UP HIS GREASY WIDE AWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOG CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER GO BACK GOOD NIGHT TAMAR
5442-41168-0000 THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE THE BALLOT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLET
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY CORPSE SERGY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL TO OTTO A BALLOT
5442-41168-0004 YOU SHED OUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE WAS NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 VOTES PLEASE BE
5442-41168-0007 THEY EXCLAIMED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION AGAINST FLEROV SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT UPON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 AND LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AND THE REFRESHMENT BAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED A SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JURRED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGE IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0014 SOGIE IVANOVITCH FROWNED
5442-41168-0015 THAT IS A MATTER FOR EVERY MAN'S OWN DECISION HE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT ON HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0017 A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETY SIX AGAINST
5442-41168-0018 SANG O THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
5442-41168-0019 THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH BUTTON AND TWO KNOTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX
5442-41168-0020 BUT THE WHOLE PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERED
5442-41168-0021 IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTATION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT THIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 WHEN THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE
5442-41168-0024 AS THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
5442-41168-0025 THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ERECTION
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNATKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT PHEROV TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMAN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGIY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID AROUND HIM
5442-41169-0002 HE'S JUST A BLACKGUARD
5442-41169-0003 I HAVE TOLD YOU SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
5442-41169-0004 THESE SERVANTS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY FIVE CHAMPAGNE
5442-41169-0006 LAST YEAR ON OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S
5442-41169-0007 NO STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
5442-41169-0008 OH WHAT IS THERE TO UNDERSTAND
5442-41169-0009 THERE IS NO MEANING AT ALL
5442-41169-0010 THEN TOO ONE MUST KEEP UP COMMUNICATIONS
5442-41169-0011 IT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF SOME SORT
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE WAS ONE'S OWN INTERESTS
5442-41169-0013 THEY ARE PROPRIETORS OF HIS SOD BUT WE ARE THE LANDOWNERS
5442-41169-0014 BUT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE WERE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND HOW IS YOUR LAD DOING
5442-41169-0017 THAT ONE'S WORK IS THROWN IN FOR NOTHING
5442-41169-0018 OH WELL ONE DOES IT WHAT WILL YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0019 AND WHAT IS MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DID IT
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASILEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THEIR LIME TREE
5442-41169-0023 HERE YE HAVE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BACH
5442-41169-0024 YE'RE MARRIED I HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER
5442-41169-0025 YES IT'S REALLY STRANGE HE WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THAT LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MOUSTACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR PUGS FOR TIMBER
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNED TO A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE'S A GLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM ALMOST ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A RETURN TOO AT A LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FROM THAT BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HERMANN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANA
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF IN DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS POSITION
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE DID NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THAT SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTILLES HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH IT ARISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBORING PALACE THE QUEEN MAY HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADDRESS LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMANN ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THE GRAMMATIUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENULT
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FOR WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FOUND CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICHKO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENUL'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSILMACHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED CHARMON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES AND TIRING WOMEN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTICE ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMY TES THE LIEGE CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLIS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LIKE PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSENUS IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT ME WAITING FROM THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE INJURED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT WAS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMANN
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENAUT HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THEIR STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HEROND LISTENED TO THE PAIR IN SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENUL ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRATEZ HERMANN'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMEANOUR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YES WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LIFE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HER MIND'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW DIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WAS STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNALLS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT CAN HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 A SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMANN PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND HIM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S LOCK
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN END AS A BOOM OF THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT SPARE HIM THE HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AID HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMANN WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER FOR ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTELIUS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS THOUGH IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24318-0010 YET IT WAS NO RELIGION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF HIS SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS LATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING HIS PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERRIAND IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU MUST CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPA SILENCED HER WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER CALMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF THIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALESTRE THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAD LOVED YOU ALWAYS
5484-24318-0021 DAPHNE EXCLAIMED TIMIDLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMANN WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORK OF MYRTIS
5484-24318-0024 BUT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU
5484-24318-0025 AND I FOOLISH BLINDED ALSO IN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL OR PALLIATE NOTHING
5484-24318-0027 SORAIS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THAT WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMINE THE RHOODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WISH
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROPPD ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEDED FARTHER INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE HAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS JUST DUE
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN AS HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERMANN
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATULLUS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HERMON
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF A DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOUR TO MYRTELUS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FEASTAL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMPS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THIS GOD GAVE RAIN AND HARVEST
5764-299665-0001 WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOUR SELF AND MYSELF
5764-299665-0002 WHETHER ANY PRAYER WAS EVER OFFERED
5764-299665-0003 WHY DID HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUAL CONFUSION
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DO HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0005 ARE THE FATHERS UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0006 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAVE BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH A LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOWN FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0008 IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0009 DID THIS GOD ALOW THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0010 DID HE ALLO TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0011 CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIEND
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DIVERRE HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN YOU ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC EARTH THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
5764-299665-0015 FAIR BUILDS THE ALTAR AND OFFERS THE SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0016 FEAR ARRESTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0017 LIPS RELIGIOUS AND POWERFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0018 CAN THEY SAY THAT HE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
5764-299665-0019 CAN WE SAY THAT ITS MERCY ENDURED FOREVER
5764-299665-0020 DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH THE RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0021 WAS THERE GOODNESS IS THERE WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0022 OUGHT THE SUPERIOR RACE TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THE INDIVIDUAL
5764-299665-0023 MOST PEOPLE CLING TO SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0024 WHEN THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE ANOTHER
5764-299665-0025 WHAT IS THIS
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSITY ADVANCES THROUGH EXPERIENCE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0028 HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND KNOWS THAT IT IS THE RIGHT ROAD
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPS IT WITH HIS DIMPLED HAND
5764-299665-0030 A POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAD TAUGHT THE CHILD A LESSON
5764-299665-0031 THAT IS A RESULT
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OR OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0033 WE WILL LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS
5764-299665-0034 THEY ARE PRAISED AND ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
5764-299665-0035 THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MODERATE
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MANNERS
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAD SAID IS BORN OF LOVE
5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THE REMARKABLE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0039 HER IMAGINATION IS CULTIVATED
5764-299665-0040 A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF HONOR
5764-299665-0041 THE SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVELY
5764-299665-0042 MEN JUDGES HIMSELF
5764-299665-0043 IN ALL THIS THERE IS SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0044 MAN WAS DECEIVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HES CHRISTIANITY DON GOULD
5764-299665-0046 WHILE THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL WERE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY FOR AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN WORTHY WITHOUT RELIGION
5764-299665-0049 COULD THERE HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0050 WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DO FOR ME
5764-299665-0051 SHE HATED PLEASURE
5764-299665-0052 THERE MUFFLED ALL THE BELLS OF GLADNESS
5764-299665-0053 THIS RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED CURSE
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE A WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO THIS ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN RAISED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THAT CATHOLIC SPIRIT
5764-299665-0058 HAS THE REVOLUTION MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES HE HAS FAILED
5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OR INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
5764-299665-0061 RELIGION HAS NOW MADE MEN FREE
5764-299665-0062 IT HAS EVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
5764-299665-0063 ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARER KNOWLEDGE THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0064 CAN'T WE CURE DISEASE BY SUPPLICATION
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR HARM AS ALMS
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER MAY LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT ITS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE SEEN THE STONES
5764-299665-0068 THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE THE BASEMENT
5764-299665-0069 IF WE BEGIN WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM
5764-299665-0070 I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST ONE IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNERSTONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM END TO EXTREMITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR COULD BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGNER BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0075 I SAY THAT I THINK
5764-299665-0076 EVERY EVENT HAS ITS PARENTS
5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED NOT
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHAINED RIS AND THEIR CAMP BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
5764-299665-0079 WE ONLY KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0080 WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT A UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE PAST THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELED
5764-299665-0082 I KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THEIR WORLD
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE THE PERFORMERS FAILED
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND UPON THE LORD ON LOVE AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VICE TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0087 FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE ONLY
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PRODUCE IT WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
5764-299665-0089 MUST THE WORLD FOREVER REMAIN A VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSIONS
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE A BURDEN AND CURSES LIKE
5764-299665-0091 PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DIFFERENT
5764-299665-0092 LAW MAY PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
5764-299665-0093 THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY TALK OR EXAMPLES
5764-299665-0094 THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THEIR WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0095 THIS FREES THEM
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME WILL BE GODLESS
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FAULTS AND BARRICADES AND FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE
6070-63485-0000 THERE DONEFA SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOW KEY TO THE CHOUETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE

6070-86744-0006 SO BE IT THEN REPLIED THE COUNT AND EXTENDING HIS HAND TOWARD A CALENDAR SUSPENDED NEAR THE CHIMNEY PIECE HE SAID TO DAY IS THE TWENTY FIRST OF FEBRUARY AND DRAWING OUT HIS WATCH ADDED IT IS EXACTLY HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK NOW PROMISE ME TO REMEMBER THIS AND EXPECT ME THE TWENTY FIRST OF MAY AT THE SAME HOUR IN THE FORENOON
6070-86744-0007 I RESIDE IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE BUT OCCUPY A PAVILION AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE COURTYARD AND TILES SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN BUILDING
6070-86744-0008 NOW THEN SAID THE COUNT RETURNING HIS TABLETS TO HIS POCKET MAKE YOURSELVES PERFECTLY EASY THE HAND OF YOUR TIME PIECE WILL NOT BE MORE ACCURATE IN MARKING THE TIME THAN MYSELF
6070-86744-0009 THAT DEPENDS WHAT DO YOU LEAVE
6070-86744-0010 FOR FRANCE NOR FOR VENICE I SHALL REMAIN IN ITALY FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO
6070-86744-0011 THEN WE SHALL NOT MET IN PARIS
6070-86744-0012 I FEAR I SHALL NOT HAVE THIS HONOR
6070-86744-0013 WELL SINCE WE MUST PART SAID THE COUNT HOLDING OUT A HAND TO EACH OF THE YOUNG MEN ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU BOTH A SAFE PLEASANT JOURNEY
6070-86744-0014 WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED ALBERT OF FRANCE WHEN THEY HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS YOU SEEM MORE THAN COMMONLY THOUGHTFUL
6070-86744-0015 I WILL CONFESS TO YOU ALBERT REPLIED FRANZ THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE ACQUAINTANCE YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0016 DID YOU EVER SEE HIM PREVIOUSLY TO COMING HITHER
6070-86744-0017 UPON MY HONOUR THEY LISTEN TO ME
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY IN THE ALMOST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAMS AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YACHT SEEN IN THE DISTANT HORIZON DRIVING UNDER FULL SAIL TOWARD PORTO VECCHIO
6070-86744-0019 THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNTESS AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86744-0020 BUT SAID JAMES THE CORSICAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSEL
6070-86744-0021 WHY REALLY THE THING SEEMS TO ME SIMPLY ENOUGH
6070-86744-0022 TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DID HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT WERE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELLOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINGTURED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY
6070-86744-0023 CERTAINLY THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IN OUR PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANSWERED
6070-86744-0024 MY DEAR FRANTZ SAID ALBERT WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO DELIVER HIM
6070-86744-0025 WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT IS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY WAS HE A NATIVE
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESS HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SENOR VAMPA WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASY AND UNCONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON GILBERT'S SIDE
6070-86744-0028 WELL SAID FRANK WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT FOR YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND MY POWERS OF REFUTATION
6070-86744-0029 AND NOW MY DEAR PARENTS LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
6070-86745-0000 BUT SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND COURT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THERE WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0002 AT A QUARTER TO TEN A VALET ENTERED HE COMPOSED WITH A LITTLE GROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS A COUNT'S CHASSEUR ALSO
6070-86745-0003 WAIT THEN DURING THE DAY TELL ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISH
6070-86745-0004 VERY WELL AT A HALF PAST TEN
6070-86745-0005 HAS THE COUNTESS UP YET
6070-86745-0006 MY VALET LEFT THE ROOM
6070-86745-0007 GOOD MORNING LUCIEN GOOD MORNING SAID ALBERT YOUR PUNCTUALITY TRULY ALARMS ME
6070-86745-0008 YOU WHOM I EXPECTED LAST WILL ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIXED WAS HALF PAST
6070-86745-0009 NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW DO NOT CONFOUND OUR PLAN
6070-86745-0010 YES HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGS IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTH
6070-86745-0011 IT IS FOR THAT REASON YER SEE ME SO EARLY
6070-86745-0012 I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO A RIDE FOR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 PESTES I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT YOU WILL FIND THEM EXECRABLE
6070-86745-0014 BESIDES THAT DOES NOT CONCERN THE HOME THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
6070-86745-0015 WELL WHAT ABOUT THE PAPERS
6070-86745-0016 TO THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND NOT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE
6070-86745-0018 COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIANS
6070-86745-0019 WITH YOUR TALENTS THEY WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMEN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
6128-63240-0001 THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID A YOUNG MAN
6128-63240-0002 SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THE
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM THE VICTOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORKADAY ASPECT
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WHITE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HAND AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN IN A BRONZE MEDAL
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS IN THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE HE DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTONFIELD
6128-63240-0009 AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VIGOROUSLY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPES AND ROARING RADICALS
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OR MURDER
6128-63240-0012 HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUAR WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6128-63240-0013 SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LETTER
6128-63240-0014 YOU BEEN IN EUROPE
6128-63240-0015 NO I HAVEN'T BEEN EVERYWHERE
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES HIM SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITIONS WHATEVER TO MISSUS LENA
6128-63240-0018 ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS TO LOOK AS IF YOU WERE
6128-63240-0019 AND MISSUS LENA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WOULD DO
6128-63240-0020 HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR
6128-63240-0021 BESIDES OLIVE DON'T WANT HER IN BUSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0022 IT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING UNCONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED THE SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNA'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS PRISCILLA'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A DINNER PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LOWNEY'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSLOW THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO B BOEOTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LOO'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002 RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THIS REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER FOR HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THIS RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTIES OF DEFEAT
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THIS STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AND BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0009 OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF LIFE BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ELECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR THE LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0012 HE WAS TOO SENSIBLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT WAS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BAZER RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF HAD THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THIS VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE LADY OF BEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT THE BALLOT
6128-63244-0002 PERHAPS I COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
6128-63244-0004 OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THIS FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0005 ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FAWENDER WHO LIVED AT ROXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINGER SUPPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0007 SHE WISH TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE
6128-63244-0008 THIS MIGHT MEAN ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0009 CHARLIE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WIDE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH MOST
6128-63244-0010 OLIVE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MISSUS FARRINGER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
6128-63244-0011 IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE THIS SHRINKING
6128-63244-0012 OUR LANGUAGE IS FOR ALL IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
6128-63244-0013 RAISE THE STANDARD AMONG THEM AND GIVE ME YOUR THOUSAND NAMES
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CURRANTS MISSUS FAIRRENDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0015 SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR REMISSION OF HIS RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0016 I LIKE TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF A SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
6128-63244-0018 OF THE UNHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
6128-63244-0019 THEY WERE THE SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THEIR DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT THE JUST REVENGE IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTAL BLOOD STAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0021 THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMEN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF HER BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE MIST OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY'S SUCCESS
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BERNARD'S EYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEM ALREADY A MARTYR
6128-63244-0024 OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG AND WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OF AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDING GLOVE
6432-63722-0000 BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YOU FIGURE ON DOIN SOME DETECTIN AN GIVEIN UP FISHIN
6432-63722-0001 AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THIS NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
6432-63722-0002 I M GOING OFF FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING AND MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
6432-63722-0003 GET READY SHAG YASTA COLONEL
6432-63722-0004 AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE PROPOSED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
6432-63722-0005 PINKUS AND DONOVAN HAVEN'T THEY CAROL YE UP
6432-63722-0006 CAROL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURLING LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
6432-63722-0007 ARE YOU GOIN TO WORK ON THAT CASE COLONEL
6432-63722-0008 BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT COLONEL THAN A CAT
6432-63722-0009 PERHAPS NO ADMITTED COLONEL ASHLEY
6432-63722-0010 WE'VE GOT OUR MINE AND THAT'S ALL WE WANT
6432-63722-0011 YOU'VE ON THE DARCY CASE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YES
6432-63722-0012 I AM WORKING IN THE INTEREST OF THE YOUNG MEN
6432-63722-0013 IT'S JUS ONE O THEM COINCIDENCES LIKE
6432-63722-0014 BUSTED A HEAD IN WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE OF A PAIR
6432-63722-0015 GAD CONTINUED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0016 VERY PAIR I WAS GOING TO BUY
6432-63722-0017 LOOK HERE UNCLE DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
6432-63722-0018 AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS WE DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGE PHUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63722-0020 NOW I'M AFRAID YOU WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
6432-63722-0021 PHE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED SHER ALI
6432-63722-0022 ANYHOW HE AND SUD DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL IT SEEMS
6432-63722-0023 NEIGHBOURS OFTEN HEARD EM SCRAPPING A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
6432-63722-0024 BEFORE DARK A MAN WENT IN TO BUY A LAMP
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND THIS HEAVY CANDLESTICK UNDER IT
6432-63722-0026 SO HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
6432-63722-0027 MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOS TALKED IN THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBOURS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0028 AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT IT'S HERE
6432-63722-0029 IT'S THE WATCH ANNOUNCED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE REACHING IN FOR IT GOING YET SEE
6432-63722-0030 YOU'RE NOT AS SQUEAMISH AS ALL THAT ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DEAD MAN'S HANDS A WOMAN'S
6432-63722-0031 AND DONALBAN'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SCEPTICAL
6432-63722-0032 YES IT MIGHT HAVE SOME ROUGH EDGES ON IT
6432-63722-0033 IF I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
6432-63722-0034 IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE HIS A BIT
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY ADDED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIME PIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF THE LEAD PENCIL
6432-63722-0038 AND DONOVAN TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH THAT
6432-63722-0039 ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE WELL
6432-63722-0040 DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF ON IT WHATEVER YOU DO WHY NO
6432-63722-0041 SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THIS WATCH

6432-63722-0046 WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING IT OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0047 RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIVE FIFTY PROPOSITION
6432-63722-0048 AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING BUT HE DOESN'T WANT IT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0049 AND YOU I DIDN'T WANT IT EITHER
6432-63722-0050 BUT I WANTED TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW

6432-63722-0058 NO ALIMONY REPLIED THE COLONEL PUZZLED IS JUST THAT
6432-63722-0059 AND THERE'S NO REASON WE SHOULDN'T KNOW
6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILLFULLY PLAYING THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
6432-63723-0001 AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH IN THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
6432-63723-0002 THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INCREASED KENNETH
6432-63723-0003 NO I WASN'T THINKING OF THIS
6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'M FINISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
6432-63723-0005 WELL I DON'T KNOW AS YOU CAN
6432-63723-0006 IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LEADER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
6432-63723-0007 IT IS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT IS WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0009 THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT AND IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
6432-63723-0010 AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENTS WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED
6432-63723-0011 THEY REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012 HE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0013 BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO ADVANCE
6432-63723-0014 LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST THEM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME INTO MY COUNCIL FEE
6432-63723-0016 NO BUT HE WILL BUT I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0017 AN IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP
6432-63723-0018 NOW I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK HERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELLER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0020 THEY HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN THE BALL ROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
6432-63723-0022 LARCH HIMSELF A PECULIAR CHARACTER
6432-63723-0023 IN A SMALLER WAY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
6432-63723-0024 AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RACHFORT HAD MARRIED
6432-63723-0025 TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED THE MONEY
6432-63723-0026 AND IN A WAY THIS WAS TRUE
6432-63723-0027 SHE ALSO SAW THE OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
6432-63723-0028 AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPILY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
6432-63723-0029 THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARG THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
6432-63723-0030 BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE MORE OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
6432-63723-0031 IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW IF THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL
6432-63723-0032 MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS FOR SOMETHING TO BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
6432-63723-0033 DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME OFF ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0034 I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM AND IT WILL TAKE TIME
6432-63723-0035 IT'S HARD FOR MISS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP LIKE A LADY
6432-63723-0036 SO KING GOT BAIL WHO PUT IT OUT
6432-63723-0037 IT WAS THYME LARCH
6432-63723-0038 THEY TOOK HARRY A WHILE AGO
6432-63723-0039 BUT HIS ARE PRETTY UNCERTAIN TREES TO BE IN JUST THE SAME
6432-63723-0040 ONLY THAT I DARCY HESITATED AND GREW
6432-63723-0041 GOOD EVENING COLONEL HE CALLED GENIALLY WILL YOU JOIN ME AT A WELSH RABBIT
6432-63723-0042 I THANK YOU NO
6432-63723-0043 I'M AFRAID MY DIGESTION ISN'T QUITE UP TO THAT AS I'VE HAD TO CUT UP MY FISHING OF LATE
6432-63723-0044 NOW AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE STORY ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER
6432-63723-0045 THE STOPPED CLOCK FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU ANY THEORY
6432-63723-0046 THERE WERE THREE OF THEM THE CENTRE FIGURE BEING THAT OF HARRY KING BUT HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOXICATED
6432-63723-0047 THAT IS NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES IT SEEMS TO BE SO NOW
6432-63723-0048 I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTURED TONES HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO USE THAT OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE USE OF LATE
6432-63723-0049 I SAYS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED THE OTHER WE'VE MISSED YOU
6432-63723-0050 I SAID I WAS GOLFING HE WENT ON EASILY DISTINCTLY THOUGH WITH AN EFFORT
6432-63723-0051 WHY POLONIUS SOMEONE ASK
6432-63723-0052 BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEHOW RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
6432-63723-0053 THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY CAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
6432-63723-0054 IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN HER JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
6432-63723-0055 I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW EM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
6432-63723-0056 THAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE DRAWER
6432-63723-0057 NO HARRY KING HAS IT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY
6938-70848-0000 EVEN THE SUNSET CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY AT NOON
6938-70848-0001 THE COLD AND RHEUMATISM OF A RAINY MONTHS VANISHED
6938-70848-0002 ASKED THE WORKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YOUNKERS
6938-70848-0003 WELL DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US ONE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARMS IN A SLING
6938-70848-0004 HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM ABOUT THE DEVILS
6938-70848-0005 WHO ARE YOU TO DESTROY THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS LENIN THE GERMAN
6938-70848-0006 WHO ARE YOU A COUNTER REVOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THEY BELOVED ADAM
6938-70848-0007 YOU CALL YOURSELF A PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU ARE NOT THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA
6938-70848-0008 THE PISANTS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT TILL THE PEASANTS
6938-70848-0009 WE KNOW WHAT THE PIRATES WILL SAY AREN'T THEY WORKING MEN LIKE OURSELVES
6938-70848-0010 THIS MAN HAD ESPECIALLY WELCOMED THE CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PEASANTS
6938-70848-0011 THIS LAST WERE A YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
6938-70848-0012 WHEREUPON THE WHOLE EXECUTED COMMITTEE LEFT THE HALL
6938-70848-0013 OUT WITH HIM THEY SHRIEKED
6938-70848-0014 FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN WITH THE BOLSHEVIKIS
6938-70848-0015 UPON MY RETURN I HAVE VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANYONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
6938-70848-0016 MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STATUS OF THE EXECUTING COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
6938-70848-0017 BY DECLINING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAS BEEN PLANNED TO BLOCK THE RE ELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE OTHER SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGREIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
6938-70848-0020 THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO WORK WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
6938-70848-0021 FOLLOWED AND OLENIN LISTENED TO NOW WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
6938-70848-0022 THE FIRST AGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISTS AND THE LANDOWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CLUMSY RELATED
6938-70848-0023 THE DUMESS AND ZAMTOOLS WERE DROPPED
6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED
6938-70848-0025 HE SPOKE TO THE ROMAN CONVENTION
6938-70848-0026 THEIR VILLAGES WILL SAVE US IN THE END
6938-70848-0027 BUT THE PRESENT MOMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IT WAS INVINCIBLE
6938-70848-0028 THE WILL OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN THE HOUSE
6938-70848-0029 THE NEW HUMANITY WILL BE BORN OF THIS WAR
6938-70848-0030 I GREET YOU WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF A NEW RUSSIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM
7018-75788-0000 THEN I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND GOING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED IN HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
7018-75788-0001 BEHOLD A SHIP WAS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THE DASHING SEA OF CLASHING WAVES
7018-75788-0002 HEARING THAT I WAS SORE TROUBLED REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED FROM THE APE KIND
7018-75788-0003 UPON THIS HE BROUGHT ME A COTTON BAG AND GIVING IT TO ME SAID TAKE THIS BAG AND FILL IT WITH PEBBLES FROM THE BEACH AND GO FORWARD WITH A COMPANY OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO WHOM I WILL GIVE A CHARGE RESPECTING THEE
7018-75788-0004 DO AS THEY DO AND BELIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FURTHER THY RETURN VOYAGES TO THY NATIVE LAND
7018-75788-0005 AND HE CARRIED ME TO THE BEACH WHERE I FILLED MY BAG WITH PEBBLES LARGE AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLK ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH BEARING A BAG LIKE MINE FILLED WITH PEBBLES
7018-75788-0006 TO THESE HE COMMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO THEIR CARE AND SAYING THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY GET HIS DAILY BREAD AND YOU SHALL EARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
7018-75788-0007 NOW SLEEPING UNDER THESE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES WHEREUPON MY COMPANIONS BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE OAK
7018-75788-0008 WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND SEEMED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
7018-75788-0009 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINTH NIGHT
7018-75788-0010 AND CEASED NOT SAILING TILL I ARRIVED SAFELY AT BUSSORAH
7018-75788-0011 THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTER AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FORGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STOREHOUSE
7018-75788-0012 AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GREAT COMFORT AND GAIN I HAD MADE
7018-75788-0013 NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING MOHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL QUESTIONS BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND WISHED HIM A GOOD DAY
7018-75788-0014 HERE I FOUND A GOOD SHIP READY FOR SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD WITH THEM GOODS OF PRICE SO I EMBARKED MY BALES THEREIN
7018-75788-0015 NOW AMONGST YOU IS ONE RIGHTEOUS WHOSE PRAYERS THE LORD WILL ACCEPT
7018-75788-0016 PRESENTLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE MOUNTAIN AND BROKE AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD OF HER WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75788-0017 BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS COLOURS AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE TRAVELLERS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
7018-75788-0018 EACH THAT DIED WAS WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTHES AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE TILL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT A LITTLE PROVISION LEFT I WHO WAS WONT TO HAVE SO MUCH
7018-75788-0019 BUT THERE IS NECESSITY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT
7018-75789-0000 THEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST NIGHT
7018-75789-0001 THEN SIGNED FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND CORMORINE ALOESWOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIP'S STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD MAKING ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
7018-75789-0002 LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE ON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS OR NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
7018-75789-0003 I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THAT PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT IN MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0005 WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THAT RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
7018-75789-0006 BUT I WAS GLAD AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE RIVER
7018-75789-0007 WHEN THEY SAW I UNDERSTOOD THEM NOT AND MADE HIM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER
7018-75789-0008 O MY BROTHER ANSWERED HE WE ARE HUSBANDMEN AND TILLERS OF THE SOIL WHO CAME OUT TO WATER OUR FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS AND FINDING THEE ASLEEP ON THIS RAFT LAID HOLD OF IT AND MADE IT FAST BY US AGAINST THOU SHOULDST AWAKE AT THY LEISURE
7018-75789-0009 I ANSWERED FOR ALLAH'S SAKE O MY LORD ERE I SPEAK GIVE ME SOMEWHAT TO EAT FOR I AM STARVING AND NEVER ASK ME WHAT THOU WILT
7018-75789-0010 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SECOND
7018-75789-0011 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HAS TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING THAT HE MAY ACQUAINT HIM WITH HIS ADVENTURES
7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE GREATEST RESPECT
7018-75789-0013 SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE IN MINE OWN LAND
7018-75789-0014 QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US ON OUR FEET AND EYES BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST US WITH THY COMPANY

7018-75789-0017 HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAMES OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER
7018-75789-0018 FOR STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE INFANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND UPON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUESTS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
7018-75789-0019 HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THAT AND AS FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST EYE WITNESSED
7018-75789-0020 FINALLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRYMAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED
7018-75789-0021 SUCH THEN O MY BROTHERS IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL ME IN MY SEVENTH VOYAGE AND TO MORROW INSHALLAH
7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU A STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX
7018-75789-0023 WHAT IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND WEPT AS OF WONT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEA MAN
7018-75789-0026 KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE IN ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH IN MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME ON THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF COMFORTABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 AND THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLIMBED TO THE MASTHEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IT IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING TO THAT WHOSO COME HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS A SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NOTHING MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WAS PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT A MISCONCEPTION AS TO PLATTERBATH'S GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADES IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD ADMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF THE BY ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DUNING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTERS
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR THE DEATHLIKE HUSH
7105-2330-0007 THE FOREMAN DELIVERED ITS MESSAGE
7105-2330-0008 A JURY FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISHED TO ADD A WRITER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A VI ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS IN HAND
7105-2330-0010 AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE POLL A JUNIOR COUNSEL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
7105-2330-0011 FIFTEEN THOUSAND SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF
7105-2330-0012 OUR LAST TIME WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN
7105-2330-0013 SIX THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTER PAFF IS OUT BEFORE THE POLE OPENS
7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RED RAPP IS INN TO NIGHT
7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRILOGNE REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
7105-2330-0017 HE CRIED WON'T GO
7105-2330-0018 HE SAYS HE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM OUT AND HE'S GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW
7105-2330-0019 SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A ELIS PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ESTIMATES
7105-2330-0020 IN ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BAND
7105-2330-0021 PAUL PUTS IN FIVE MINUTES
7105-2330-0022 IS BLADDERBUFF OUT YET
7105-2330-0023 IN HEAVEN'S NAME MY
7105-2330-0024 THE CHIEF ORGANIZER RUN OFF
7105-2330-0025 THIS WAS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
7105-2330-0026 CAN'T YOU GET THE STRIKE PERMIT ASKED THE ORGANISER
7105-2330-0027 I' WILL TRY SAID THE HOME SECRETARY AND WENT TO THE TELEPHONE
7105-2330-0028 EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WE'LL FIGHT THE OTHER WAY
7105-2330-0029 A TELEGRAM BROUGHT IN
7105-2330-0030 IT WAS FROM THE CENTRAL COMETY ROOMS OF NEMESIS
7105-2330-0031 WITHOUT A BAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND HE HAD NO BAND
7105-2330-0032 OR QUARTER PAST TEN HALF PAST
7105-2330-0033 HAVE YOU ANY BRAND INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY NATURE TO PLAY
7105-2330-0034 DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANIZER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS ALL SORT OF THINGS
7105-2330-0035 THE WARDERS HAVE A PRIVATE BRAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THE MEN THEMSELVES
7105-2330-0036 LEND US YOUR INSTRUMENTS SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZER
7105-2330-0037 THE POPULAR SONG OF THE MOMENT SAID THE AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT TO THE IMPROVISED TRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONER STRODE FORTH TO FREEDOM
7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0040 HIS SEAT WAS LOST AFTER ALL BY A NARROW MATURITY
7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENCE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTERBETH FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
7105-2340-0000 WITH THAT NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIS HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF THING ONE WANTED IN ONE'S HOUSE
7105-2340-0001 WELL THE FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID THE HUSBAND OR ER DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE STATE
7105-2340-0002 BESIDE CYNICISM APART HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIS FAILING
7105-2340-0003 WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY AND MERELY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVE NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THE THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY
7105-2340-0004 WILFRED PIGEONCOTE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRED PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTEREFFECTS OF A POLO INCIDENT
7105-2340-0005 A WILFRED PICHINCOTE HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONORS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRED HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK
7105-2340-0006 AND THIS REPUTATION WAS AN UNPLEASANT ONE
7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOL DAYS ONWARD HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF CLEPTOMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF A COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION
7105-2340-0008 THE SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEON COLE TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THEIR CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRID SAYING HE IS PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS
7105-2340-0009 SIGNED WILFRED PIGEONSCOTE
7105-2340-0010 I SUPPOSE HE'S BRINGING US A PRESENT FOR THIS SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS
7105-2340-0011 THE TALK FLITTED CARELESSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER
7105-2340-0012 AT THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER THEIR NERVOUSNESS AND AWKWARDNESS INCREASED
7105-2340-0013 OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETERS SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUEST HERE THEY ALL ARE
7105-2340-0014 SUCH NICE YOUTHFUL GIFTS A FEW DIPLICATES OF COURSE
7105-2340-0015 SEVEN CREAM JUGS PUT IN BEAUTY
7105-2340-0016 WE FEEL THAT WE MUST LIVE ON FREEDOM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
7105-2340-0017 OF COURSE SOME OF THEM MIGHT BE CHANGED
7105-2340-0018 I PUT IT DOWN BY THE CLARET JUG SAYS WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER OBJECT
7105-2340-0019 VIGILANCE IS NOT COMPLETELY CROWNED WITH THE SENSE OF VICTORY
7105-2340-0020 AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR VISITOR MISSUS PETER EXPRESSED HER CONVICTION THAT HE HAD EATEN SOMETHING
7105-2340-0021 HOW ON THE EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I'M HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY ONE OFF
7105-2340-0022 IT WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO
7105-2340-0023 WILFRID WAS LATE IN COMING OUT TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS
7105-2340-0024 IT IS AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEING TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU
7105-2340-0025 IT WAS A LITTLE PRESENT TO MY MOTHER AND MYSELF FOR YOUR SILVER WEDDING
7105-2340-0026 I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND YOU SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES BUT I FELT RATHER AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING YOU ANOTHER
7105-2340-0027 THEN SNATCHER HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THESE MANY YEARS
7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNESTON PAGE ANDCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPACTS OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
7105-2340-0029 HUSBANDS AND WIFE LOOKED BLANKLY AND DESPERATELY AT ONE ANOTHER
7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THAT HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE ARE AT BREAKFAST
7105-2340-0031 SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVER WORK AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS
7105-2340-0032 THE PIGEON COATES HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION
7105-2340-0033 PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MOMENTS THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
7105-2340-0034 MISSUS PETER RETURNED TO HER GUEST WITH CONFIDENTIAL COYNESS
7105-2340-0035 PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS A TRANSCEND OF FAMILY GOOD LORD
7105-2340-0036 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A KLEPTOMANIA LIKE COUSIN'S SNATCHER
7105-2340-0037 BRAVE LITTLE WOMAN SAID PETER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE
7902-96591-0000 I'M FOR THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST
7902-96591-0001 DON'T CRY HE SAID I IS OBLIGED TO COME
7902-96591-0002 AND AS YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
7902-96591-0003 I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU WERE
7902-96591-0004 THAT MY FATHER SIR RISDON GRAHAM HAS SMUGGLING GOODS HERE
7902-96591-0005 HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YE SHALL NOT TELL
7902-96591-0006 PRAY PRAY SIR YOU WILL NOT ARCHIE WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0007 AND AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD REITSTROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 AND ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THE STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME TO THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 ILL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 AND IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY COULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT
7902-96591-0014 THAT KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 A WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY OUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTEL PIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0018 YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP A CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0019 NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE NOT DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING OF SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL AT TWO PLACES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY COULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE AS THE HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE HIS
7902-96592-0000 SURE YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE SAY YES FATHER QUITE
7902-96592-0001 I'M GOING OVER TO BREAKFAST

7902-96592-0004 TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAN AWAY TO NIGHT
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHIE RYSTROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER DREAM THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEAALE THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHY DID ANDIE CALL MISTER GURR FATHER
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LATE WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0010 BUT I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE
7902-96592-0011 NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RIGDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RUN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARED NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONEWORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION AND INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 WRENM WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE
7902-96592-0016 HULLO HE SAID WHO YOU

7902-96592-0025 ARCHIE STEP BACK TO THE DOOR LISTENING BUT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND
7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRISONER AS HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE CHINA PRESENTED ITSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LATER IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND ADDRESSED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR CELLING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK A DIRK INTO ITS SHEATH
7902-96592-0032 NO I CAN'T PART WITH THE HA HA LAUGHED THE BOY JEERINGLY

7975-280057-0002 MY MOTHER WHO WAS BESHEBA FRISTAUX OF INDEPENDENCE WAS A DAUGHTER OF RICHARD FRISTEAUX WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON AT NEW ORLEANS JACKSON COUNTY HAVING BEEN SO NAMED AT MY GRANDFATHER FRISTEAUX'S INSISTENCE

7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SAME PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER HOME
7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO MAKE WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISONVILLE SHE WENT TO WAVERLEY WHERE HE WAS HOUNDED CONTINUALLY

7975-280063-0009 MAJOR FOSTER IN A LETTER TO JUDGE GEORGE M BENNET OF MINNEAPOLIS
7975-280063-0010 I WAS TOLD BY SOME OF OUR MEN FROM THE WESTERN BORDER OF THE STATE THAT THEY RECOGNISE THAT DARING YOUNG RIDER AS COAL YOUNGER
7975-280063-0011 ABOUT NINE THIRTY M I WAS SHOT DOWN
7975-280063-0012 THE WOUNDED OF BOTH FORCES WERE CARRIED UP AND WERE PLACED IN HOUSES
7975-280076-0000 ALTHOUGH EVERY BOOK PURPORTING TO NARRATE THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS HAD TOLD OF THE LIBERTY ROBBERY AND IMPLIED THAT WE HAD A PART IN IT THE YOUNGERS WERE NOT SUSPECTED AT THAT TIME NOR FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPARDS RED MARKERS AND BUD PENCE WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUANTRELLE
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAID WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH BLOODSHED JUDGE MC LEAN THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FATALLY
7975-280076-0003 NO WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGERS BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
7975-280076-0004 JUNE THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE OBICCOCK BROTHERS BANK AT CROYTON IOWA WAS ROBBED OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BY SEVEN MEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
7975-280076-0005 IT WAS CHARGED THAT ARTHUR MAC COY A C MC COY AND MYSELF HAD BEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE GAD'S HILL AFFAIR AND THE TWO STAGE ROBBERIES
7975-280076-0006 THE PARTS OF THIS MATTER NOW RELEVANT ARE AS FOLLOWS
7975-280076-0007 YOU MUST USE THIS LETTER IN YOUR OWN WAY
7975-280076-0008 I SHALL GIVE YOU THIS OUTLINE AND SKETCH OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND ACTIONS AT THE TIME OF CERTAIN ROBBERIES WITH WHICH I AM CHARGED
7975-280076-0009 AT THE TIME OF THE GALLETON BANK ROBBERY I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM PLEES TAILOR AND RECTOR
7975-280076-0010 THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SHERIFF BERKELEY AND FIFTEEN OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
7975-280076-0011 I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS DEAD FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY
7975-280076-0012 I NOW WENT TO ARKANSAS AND RETURNED TO SAINT CLAIR COUNTY ABOUT THE FIRST OF MAY
7975-280076-0013 I WENT TO KANSAS WHERE OUR CATTLE WERE IN WOODS AND COUNTY AT COLONEL RIDGE'S
7975-280076-0014 DURING THE SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS AND AS THERE WAS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED THAT SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE I WAS
7975-280076-0015 I WENT THROUGH INDEPENDENCE AND FROM THERE TO S WEBS
7975-280076-0016 THERE I TOOK DINNER AND THEN WENT TO DOCTOR L W T WHITMAN'S
7975-280076-0017 OUR BUSINESS THERE WAS TO SEE EP WEST HE WAS NOT AT HOME BUT THE FAMILY WILL REMEMBER THAT WE WERE THERE
7975-280076-0018 WE CROSSED ON THE BRIDGE STAYED IN THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING WE RODE UP INTO THE CITY
7975-280076-0019 I MET SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AMONG THEM WAS BOB HUDSPIT
7975-280076-0020 WE WERE NOT ON GOOD TERMS AT THE TIME NOR HAVE I BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS
7975-280076-0021 POOR JOHN HE HAS BEEN HUNTED DOWN AND SHOT LIKE A WILD BEAST AND NEVER WAS A MORE INNOCENT
7975-280076-0022 DOCTOR L LEWIS WAS HIS POSITION
7975-280076-0023 THERE WERE SIXTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS THERE WHO WILL TESTIFY IN ANY COURT THAT JOHN AND I WERE THERE
7975-280076-0024 HELVIN FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WERE ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND EITHER OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE ABOVE FOR JOHN AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MISTER SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND IN HIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MISTER AND MISS FICKLE AFTER THE SERVICE
7975-280076-0025 ABOUT THE LAST OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN I ARRIVED IN CARROLL PARISH LOUISIANA
7975-280076-0026 I STAYED THERE UNTIL THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE
7975-280076-0027 I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THAT TIME I WAS AT NEOCIO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAY
7975-280076-0028 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY AT AEDER IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY
7975-280084-0000 I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED WE SHOULD NOT SHOOT ANY MORE
7975-280084-0001 WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOOD BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT INTO A BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
7975-280084-0002 WHEN I CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
7975-280084-0003 G S ALLEN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
7975-280084-0004 GET YOUR GUNS BOYS THEYRE ROBBING THE BANK
7975-280084-0005 AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS ON THE BRIDGE THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
7975-280084-0006 ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT IN THE CAMP
7975-280084-0007 CHADWELL WOODS AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO THE PEOPLE ON THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
7975-280084-0008 IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE WOODS
7975-280084-0009 ANYHOW THE STREET WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY HOT
7975-280084-0010 EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN ANY DIRECTION
7975-280084-0011 DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UPSTAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREETS
7975-280084-0012 CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND TOM RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILLER'S MARE
7975-280084-0013 WHAT KEPT ME SO LONG I ASKED PITTS
7975-280084-0014 AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THAT BANK I TAKE THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0015 WHERE'S THE MONEY OUTSIDE THAT SAFE BOB ASKED
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL FITZ CHASED WITH A BULLET
7975-280084-0017 THE FIRST ONE MISSED HIM BUT THE SECOND WENT THROUGH ITS RIGHT SHOULDER
7975-280085-0000 THAT NIGHT IT STARTED TO RAIN AND WE WORN OUT OUR HORSES
7975-280085-0001 FRIDAY WE MOVE TOWARDS WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMPED BETWEEN ELYSIAN AND GERMAN LAKE
7975-280085-0002 BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARMHOUSE CLOSE TO MANCADO
7975-280085-0003 ONE DAY A MAN NAMED DUNNING DISCOVERED US AND WE TOOK HIM PRISONER
7975-280085-0004 FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE APPEARED NOT TO
7975-280085-0005 NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POST HASTE INTO MANCATO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
7975-280085-0006 THE WHISTLE AT THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
7975-280085-0007 HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH A PILLOW ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
7975-280085-0008 AND THEY SOON AFTER GOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM BROKE MY WALKING STICK WITH A SHOT
7975-280085-0009 WE WERE IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG SAWED TREES WHEN THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE ANIMALS AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
7975-280085-0010 SIX STEPS TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T O VALT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J SEAVERSON
7975-280085-0011 FORMING IN LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATED THE FIRE OF THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ROBBERS WERE DISCOVERED
7975-280085-0012 MAKE TO THE HORSES I SAID EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
7975-280085-0013 THERE'S NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHARGE THEM AND TAKE IT IF WE CAN
7975-280085-0014 I GOT UP AS A SIGNAL FOR THEIR CHARGE AND WE FIRED ONE VOLLEY
7975-280085-0015 ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELLED ON BOB IN SPITE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS THE FLAG OF TRUCE
7975-280085-0016 SHERIFF GLISPON OF WATTAWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
7975-280085-0017 INCLUDING THOSE RECEIVED IN AND ON THE WAY FROM NORTH FIELDS I HAD ELEVEN WOUNDS
7975-280085-0018 AND SHERIFF GLISPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A PROTECTORATE THAT MINNESOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
8131-117016-0000 MADAME MURDOCK
8131-117016-0001 BUT MARSPORT HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO FILL IT OFF
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TIME OF MEN
8131-117016-0003 THE STONEWALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS FOUR HUNDRED
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DARELEX AND FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORIES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THERE NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OFF
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOP KEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS FORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0007 CAPTAIN MURDOCK WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND NOW WAS ASKED FOR MORE MEN
8131-117016-0008 THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET THEM FOR THEM
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE MOUNTAIN FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE RELIEF
8131-117016-0010 I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY WE COULD ON EARTH
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS THERE AND THAT MEANS EVERY ONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT
8131-117016-0012 THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE IN THE STONE WALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
8131-117016-0013 HE PICKED UP FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FIVE WILL COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TO NIGHT PICK ANY ROW THAT'S OPEN O K THEN LET'S GO
8131-117016-0015 BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCK'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH POP
8131-117016-0016 TWO YEARS GORDON UNDERSTOOD
8131-117016-0017 OF A SECOND GORDON CURSED HIMSELF
8131-117016-0018 HE BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT SECURITY THERE
8131-117016-0019 NOBODY HAD TRIED TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHOUR BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE PRINCESS WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THAT FINELY TURNED CLUB IN HIS HANDS
8131-117016-0024 GORDON'S EYES POPPED THAT
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWED THIS SENTIMENT HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVING NOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER FOUR COBS HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
8131-117016-0027 IT BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEYS
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COOPS STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0029 TO FIND A PHONE AND CALLED THE WAGON
8131-117016-0030 WE'RE NOT USING WAGONS MURDOCK TOLD US LINE THEM UP
8131-117016-0031 IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED TOGETHER
8131-117016-0032 MURDOCK INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEK
8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS WHITE AS GORDON'S FELT
8131-117016-0034 I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD THAT MAN
8131-117016-0035 COLONEL THEYD KILL ME I DON'T KNOW
8131-117016-0036 MURDOCK TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND RETURNED TO THE WRETCHED TUFTS
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AN I'LL FIND YOU
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER THE
8131-117016-0039 MURDOCK SENT ONE OF THE MEN TO PICK OUT A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD
8131-117016-0040 OF THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN WHO'D BEEN BEATEN BEFORE
8131-117016-0041 GO A STRETCHER AND TAKE HIM WHEREVER HE BELONGS HE ORDERED
8131-117016-0042 BUT THE CAPTAIN ENTERED FINALLY SIGHING
8131-117016-0043 NO THE COPSE THEY'RE GIVING ME THEY'RE COVERED GORDON
8131-117016-0044 BUT THE STONEWALL GANG IS BACKING BLAIN
8131-117016-0045 BUT IT'S GOT TO BE TOUGH ON THEM
8131-117016-0046 BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE BOUGHT A YELLOW TICKET FROM SECURITY
8131-117016-0047 MURDOCK BLINKED THEN DROPPED HIS EYES SLOWLY
8131-117016-0048 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAIN WILL BE REELECED
8131-117016-0049 NOBODY WANTS EM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER
8131-117016-0050 EVER SEE A MARTIAN ELECTOR
8131-117016-0051 NO YOU'RE A FORSTER HE CAN'T LOSE
8131-117016-0052 AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP IN THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WHAT THE SPY IN GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT ROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0055 COST HER MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE ITZZY IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE SEES IT
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEAS O THE STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
8131-117016-0058 THE GROUPS WERE MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCK WAS TRAINING A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
8131-117016-0059 IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING WAS IT
8131-117016-0060 THIS COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE HAD SEEN ON EARTH
8131-117016-0061 BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR THAT IF MAYOR WAIN WAS RE ELECTED
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHOR BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORISED PRECINCT HOUSE
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE YOU HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117017-0002 AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HAYES'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117017-0003 GORDON SHOOK THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MARS SPEAKER LET OUT A SHRILL WHISTLE
8131-117017-0004 GUNS SOMETIMES SEEMED TO BE FLOURISHING EVERYWHERE
8131-117017-0005 YOU CANT DO IT TO ME

8131-117017-0030 AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COPPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN ISZY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USE THE INFORMATION WITH A BEAT SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT TO THE UPPER BRACKETS HE'D STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS

8188-269290-0033 BUT MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LIZLEY AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
8188-269290-0034 MISS LAUDALE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHER TUTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE DIFFERENT HALLS ON A RAISED PLATFORM
8188-269290-0035 THEN A RO CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE WAS ANY COLCHESTER
8188-269290-0036 THE PHYSICAL PART OF THEIR TRAINING AND ALSO THE MENTAL PART ARE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED IN THIS GREAT HOUSE OF LEARNING SHE CONTINUED BUT THE SPIRITUAL PART IT SEEMS TO ME OUGHT NOW TO BE STRENGTHENED
8188-269290-0037 HERE HEAR AND ONCE AGAIN HERE
8188-269290-0038 SHE UTTERED HER SHRILL REMARK STANDING UP
8188-269290-0039 MARGERRIE AND EILEEN WERE CLOSE TO HER
8188-269290-0040 I WILL TALK WITH YOU BELLE ARCHISSON PRESENTLY SHE SAID
8188-269290-0041 THE NAMES OF THE PROPOSED MEMBERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED ME BEFORE THIS DAY WEEK

8188-269290-0043 YOU UNDERSTAND SHE CONTINUED
8188-269290-0044 GOD ANSWERS TO EACH OF YOU YOU WERE
8188-269290-0045 THE WORLD SAYS I AM NOT BUT GOD SAYS YES YOU ARE
8188-269290-0046 ALL MEN ARE THEIR BROTHERS
8188-269290-0047 FOR ALL WHO SIN ALL YOU SUFFER YOU ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RESPONSIBLE
8188-269290-0048 AFTER THE SERVICE THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
8188-269290-0049 IT WAS PAST NINE O'CLOCK WHEN SHE LEFT THE HALL
8188-269290-0050 AS SHE WAS DOING SO MISSUS FRERE CAME UP
8188-269290-0051 HENRY COLCHESTER IS YOUR ROOMFELLOW IS SHE NOT SHE SAID
8188-269290-0052 I SEE BY YOUR FACES MISSUS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DISTRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING ARE YOU KEEPING ANYTHING BACK
8188-269290-0053 I AM AFRAID I AM REPLIED LIZZIE DISTRACTED NOW IN HER TONE
8188-269290-0054 I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS LARDALE EXCEPT A VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED HERSELF
8188-269290-0055 MY EXCUSES MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
8188-269290-0056 THE FELLOW WHO BREAKS THE RULES HAS TO BE PUNISHED
8188-269290-0057 I WILL TELL YOU
8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHILST THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
8188-274364-0001 OF THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MONTORRAS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICIALS IN THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE CAPITAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0004 OR THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER IT
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW A FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON HIS CRIME BEFORE MYSELF
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION AWAKE THOSE SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UP A COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAD LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALL FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0007 HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE CONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOUR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE CONWEALTH
8188-274364-0008 MY LORDS I HAVE NEVER TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG VANE FALLING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED A MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO PYM WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAD NO MORE MONEY
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WOULD ADMIT
8280-266249-0000 OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGER ONE
8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THAT JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSELS STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOUR
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LIGHT HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0004 THERE ARE SOME NICE LOOKING PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISSUS TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0005 BESIDES OURSELVES ADDED CAPTAIN RONALD LAUGHING
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ANSWERED THAT LITTLE GROUP YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I BELIEVE
8280-266249-0007 AND WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF MY HERALD I SHOULD JUDGE
8280-266249-0008 DO YOU WANT WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009 HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE FELLOW
8280-266249-0010 SUPPOSE YOU AND YOU SHAKE HANDS FRANK
8280-266249-0011 I DO INDEED THOUGH POSSIBLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF THEIR AILMENTS
8280-266249-0012 DOUBTLESS THAT'S THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN WHERE THERE'S A LIGHT
8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL AROUND HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT OF TOBACCO PLACED UPON THE TONGUE OF THE DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0017 WAS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENTS
8280-266249-0018 THAT A FRENCH POLYTECHNICA INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS UPON THE MIND
8280-266249-0019 NOTICE THE MULTITUDES OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEWERS
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN UPON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0021 AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH THE WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0022 HENCE A RESORT TO CIDER AND BEERS
8280-266249-0023 NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU THAT YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN
8280-266249-0024 FOR YOU ARE BOUGHT WITH THE PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GODS
8280-266249-0025 WE SURELY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR BODIES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT OUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE WHOLLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISSUS DALEY
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN AND IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND NOT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0030 THEY ARE GAMBLING YONDER AN I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0031 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE CITY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION
8280-266249-0032 NO SIR IS NOT HERE
8280-266249-0033 AS THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TOO
8280-266249-0034 NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKY LIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED ON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0035 THE VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING TO HIS STATEROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0036 WHAT DOES IT MEAN CRIED
8280-266249-0037 A VENTRILOQUISTFUL BOARD OF COURSE RETURNED ANOTHER LET'S FOLLOW AND SEE THE FUN
8280-266249-0038 I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REMARKED THE FIRST LOOKED HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT COME ON
8280-266249-0039 THAT FELLOW NICK WARD IS A NOTED BLACK LEG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN THE FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE
8280-266249-0040 WHO ASKED THE MATE I'VE SEEN UP HERE THOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THE STEERAGE
8280-266249-0041 THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A CALM PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8280-266249-0042 A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SOVEREIGN IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0043 LET ME GO YELLED WARE MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIS ARMS
8280-266249-0044 I DINKS NO I DINKS I DID YOU VON LASSION RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
8280-266249-0045 THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER BUT THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0046 MISTER SILBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0047 YET THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF THIS PROFESSION
8280-266249-0048 THEY KEPT IT UP TILL AFTER NIGHT
8280-266249-0049 THEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN HIS STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0050 A INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STAKES WERE VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0051 THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREEN BACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EYE TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND
8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WAS SILENCE AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS WITH A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
8280-266249-0054 IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED WARD LOOK WHAT'S THERE LOOK YES
8280-266249-0055 WHAT CAN HAVE BEEN THEY ASKED EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0056 OH CONSCIENCE WHAT FOOLS WE ARE
8280-266249-0057 IT WAS THE LAST GAME OF CARDS OF THAT TRIP
8280-266249-0058 THE CAPTAIN COMING SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0059 TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE BAILIES WERE IN VERY STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0060 OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAYS WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE
8280-266249-0061 AND HOW WONDERFULLY HE HAS ANSWERED THEIR PETITIONS
8280-266249-0062 ELSIE SAID PRESSING HER HAND AFFECTIONATELY ARE WE NOT SISTERS IN CHRIST
8280-266249-0063 YE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD BY FAITH OF CHRIST JESUS
8280-266249-0064 YE ARE ALL MEN IN CHRIST JESUS
8280-266249-0065 WE FEEL MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE ARE ONLY THE STEWARDS OF HIS BOUNTY AND BECAUSE HE HAS SAID INASMUCH AS YOU HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME IT IS THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE AND DELIGHT TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIS PEOPLE
8461-258277-0000 WHEN IT WAS A SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTEENTH NIGHT
8461-258277-0001 BUT HE ANSWERED NEEDS MUST THEY HAVE ZANAB UL SAY NOW SUDDENLY THERE CAME A RAP AT THE DOOR AND THE MAID SAID WHO IS AT THE DOOR
8461-258277-0002 THE KNOCKER REPLIED KAMAR DAUGHTER OF AZARIAH THE JEW SAY ME IS SALI OF CAIRO WITH YOU
8461-258277-0003 REPLIED THE BROKER'S DAUGHTER OR THOU DAUGHTER OF A DOG
8461-258277-0004 AND HAVING THUS ISLAMISED SHE ASKED HIM TWO MEN IN THE FAITH OF ALL ISLAM GIVE MARRIAGE PORTIONS TO WOMEN OR DO WOMEN DOWER MEN
8461-258277-0005 THEN SHE THREW DOWN THE JEW'S HEAD BEFORE HIM
8461-258277-0006 THEN THE CAUSE OF HER SLAYING HER SIRE WAS AS FOLLOWS
8461-258277-0007 THEN HE SET OUT REJOICING TO RETURN TO THE BARRACK ON THE FORTY
8461-258277-0008 SO HE ATE AND FELL DOWN SENSELESS FOR THE SWEET MEATS WERE DRUGGED WITH BANG WHEREUPON THE KAZI BUNDLED HIM INTO THE SACK AND MADE OFF WITH THEM CHARGER AND CHESS AND ALL TO THE BARCA DE FORTE
8461-258277-0009 PRESENTLY HASAN SCHUMANN CAME OUT OF A CLOSET AND SAID TO HIM HAST THOU GOTTEN THAT GEAR O ALI
8461-258277-0010 SO HE TOLD HIM WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM AND ADDED IF I KNOW WHITHER THAT RASCAL IS GONE AND WHERE TO FIND THE KNAVE I WOULD PAY HIM OUT
8461-258277-0011 AND KNOWEST THOU WHITHER HE WENT
8461-258277-0012 ANSWERED HASAN I KNOW WHERE HE IS AND OPENING THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET SHOWED HIM THE SWEETMEAT CELLAR IN DRUGGED AND SENSELESS
8461-258277-0013 SO I WENT ROUND ABOUT THE HIGHWAYS OF THIS CITY TILL I MET A SWEETMEAT SELLER AND BUYING HIS CLOTHES AND STOCK IN TRADE AND GEAR FOR TEN DINARS DID WHAT WAS DONE
8461-258277-0014 QUOTH AL RASHID WHOSE HEAD WAS THIS
8461-258277-0015 SO ALI RELATED TO HIM ALL THE THAT PASSED FROM FIRST TO LAST AND THE CALIPH SAID I HAD NOT THOUGHT THOU WOULDST KILL HIM FOR THAT HE WAS A SORCERER
8461-258277-0016 HE REPLIED I HAVE FIFTY LADS BUT THEY ARE IN CAIRO
8461-278226-0000 AND LAURA HAD HER OWN PETS
8461-278226-0001 SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED A SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WEAR THE NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JUAN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
8461-278226-0002 ONE EVENING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-278226-0003 I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES THE MOUNTAIN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
8461-278226-0004 I REMEMBER ALL THE REUBENS SAYS AT THE LOUVRE I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
8461-278226-0005 SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH POOR GREEN GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AYESHA BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0006 IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THAT DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0007 BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN IN THE LIBRARY
8461-278226-0008 PHILIP JOSCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HE HIS WIFE MADE THIS DISCOVERY
8461-278226-0009 HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE PHILIPS LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
8461-278226-0010 I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MOURNING ROOM OF JOCELYN STROCH
8461-278226-0011 SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ARTIST PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KIRSTON LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
8461-278226-0012 THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF FOR THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
8461-278226-0013 BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAD NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARDS THE WORKS OF OTHERS
8461-278226-0014 I DON'T THINK IT WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HOUSE
8461-278226-0015 YOU WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOR PHILIP IF YOU WILL SAY YES
8461-281231-0000 HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORTH TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THE WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS
8461-281231-0001 IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORCLESTONE
8461-281231-0002 AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH THE FEAR OF APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
8461-281231-0003 HOW ART THOU HE EXCLAIMED IN TERROR
8461-281231-0004 LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH EURESA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
8461-281231-0005 EXCLAIMED THE GENTLEMAN OH

8461-281231-0007 THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID EURICA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO WILL EXTINGUISH THEM
8461-281231-0008 MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LEAD HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
8461-281231-0009 THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY THE STRACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
8461-281231-0010 THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCE ITS WAY INWARD IN DESPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
8461-281231-0011 TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING THE LEADER'S EFFORTS TO STOP THEM
8461-281231-0012 THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL WRUNG WITH HER FURIOUS BLOWS
8461-281231-0013 AT LENGTH DE BLACY FELL
8461-281231-0014 TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK THY PLEASURE FOR ME
8461-281231-0015 YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS THEE TO DO
8461-281231-0016 EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER TO PERISH
8461-281231-0017 THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF THIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAMBER
8461-281231-0018 RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH THIS THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS
8461-281231-0019 BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATING IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT FRONT DE BOEUF
8461-281231-0020 AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE IUREKA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
8461-281231-0021 BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND ROSE THROUGH THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHING DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTER
8461-281231-0022 AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAVE CONSUMED HER TYRANT
8461-281231-0023 WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TOLKELESTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
8461-281231-0024 HE LEFT A GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF KONIGSBURG AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTER OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ADDLESTANE WAS LAID
8461-281231-0025 DEBRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF ON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOOD
8461-281231-0026 HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO GIVE IT AS A MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING
8461-281231-0027 SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS STRONG WAR HORSE AND DROVE OFF THROUGH THE FOREST
8461-281231-0028 DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF OAK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER REBECCA
8461-281231-0029 AND WITH THIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OFF TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
8461-281231-0030 THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FROM DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
8461-281231-0031 HE APPEALED TO THE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN HIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARD HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
8461-281231-0032 BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LYCAS DE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON THE VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY
8461-281231-0033 HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
8461-281231-0034 POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OATHS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK ABOUT AND TO MARK INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
8461-281231-0036 HE GAZED ACCORDINGLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
8461-281231-0037 AT HIS FEET WAS PLACE A TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
8461-281231-0038 THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND HER SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
