1688-142285-0000 THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT THIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUESTS DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANY THING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOPBOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAS BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PART OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 HIS FATHER DIED IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORK HOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODEST PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISTER THORNTON IS NOT WONT I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LEFT MERTON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED ASKED THE FATHER
1688-142285-0016 O PAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED ON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN ROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT ARE HIS WORDS
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WRITING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER IT CAME
1688-142285-0024 I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0025 I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0026 PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT ALL
1688-142285-0027 I DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THE KIND
1688-142285-0028 GOOD NIGHT CHILD
1688-142285-0029 THERE WAS SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN THE BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMALLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THE MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTION SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHT FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSIE HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL BESSY HOW ARE YOU
1688-142285-0038 BETTER NOT BETTER IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
1688-142285-0039 NOT EXACTLY SAID MARGARET SMILING
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER AND NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED OF MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND OF BOOLAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED ROUND TO WALK ALONGSIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
1688-142285-0042 FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0043 AT LAST SHE SPOKE IN A LOW VOICE
1688-142285-0044 BESSIE DO YOU WISH TO DIE
1688-142285-0045 BESSIE WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED
1688-142285-0046 NOT LESS THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
1688-142285-0047 WHAT WAS IT
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I HAD LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON
1688-142285-0049 I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
1688-142285-0050 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU
1688-142285-0051 THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY TURNED INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
1688-142285-0053 YOU'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GROVISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0054 AND NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
1688-142285-0055 GASPED BESSIE AT LAST
1688-142285-0056 BESSIE TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER HER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS
1688-142285-0059 NOW I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED TOO
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVED IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0061 I BELIEVED WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
1688-142285-0062 THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVED YOUNG WOMAN
1688-142285-0063 I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY BIG DEAL
1688-142285-0064 BUT WHO'S COME AT LAST AND WHO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HE'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT HE KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT
1688-142285-0065 IT'S SIMPLE NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HARD TO WORK
1688-142285-0066 BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLAYED THE MORE WITH MARGARET
1688-142285-0067 DON'T THINK HARDLY OF HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
1688-142285-0068 I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE CHOKED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF ARTHUR IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0069 THE FEVERISH COLOR CAME INTO HER CHEEKS AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYE
1688-142285-0070 BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL O MY HEART
1688-142285-0071 SHE PUT HER HANDS TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALE
1688-142285-0072 MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST ON HER BOSOM
1688-142285-0073 PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSIE ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED ITS BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
1688-142285-0075 I WILL COME TO MORROW SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0076 MARGARET WENT AWAY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
1688-142285-0077 SHE IS LATE FOR TEA AT HOME
1688-142285-0078 HAVE YOU MET WITH THE SERVANT DEAR
1688-142285-0079 NO MAMMA THAT ANN BUCKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
1688-142285-0080 S'POSE I'LL TRY SAID MISTER HALE
1688-142285-0081 EVERY BODY ELSE HAS HAD THEIR TURN AT THIS GREAT DIFFICULTY NOW LET ME TRY
1688-142285-0082 I MAY BE THE CINDERELLA TO PUT ON THIS SLIPPER AFTER ALL
1688-142285-0083 WHAT WOULD YOU DO PAPA HOW WOULD YE SET ABOUT IT
1688-142285-0084 WELL I I WOULD APPLY TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS

1688-142285-0087 MISSUS THORNTON THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HALE QUIETLY
1688-142285-0088 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
1688-142285-0089 PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MAY SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
1688-142285-0090 SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANYONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY

1688-142285-0092 I'M SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
1688-142285-0093 TAKE NOTICE THAT THIS IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU ARE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT

1998-29455-0022 REMEMBERED THAT NEITHER OF THEM KNEW ANY BETTER

1998-29455-0036 DICKIE WAS FULL OF QUESTIONS BUT MISTER BALE HAD NO ANSWERS FOR THEM
1998-29455-0037 NOR WAS IT SUNDAY ON WHICH THEY TOOK A REST AND WASHED THEIR SHIRTS ACCORDING TO MISTER BEAL'S RULE OF LIFE
1998-29455-0038 THEY DID NOT STAY THERE BUT WALKED OUT ACROSS THE DOWNS WHERE THE SKYLARKS WERE SINGING AND ON A DIP OF THE DOWNS CAME UPON GREAT STONE WALLS AND TOWERS VERY STRONG AND GREY

2033-164915-0000 AND ALL THESE
2033-164915-0001 THEN SHE THREW HERSELF ON HIM AND HE GATHERED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN FELL DOWN IN A FAINTING FIT
2033-164915-0002 WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW HIS CASE HE WONDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEWHAT TO COVER THEM WAITED TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
2033-164915-0003 AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND UZHAT AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LEFT HER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THESE VERSES
2033-164915-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANTS HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM BUT HOW HE HAD GOT FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BUYING HOW HE HAD MADE A MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD GONE IN TO HER AND HOW THE KING THEIR SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARRKAN
2033-164915-0005 NOW GO TO THY MASTER AND BRING HIM QUICKLY TO ME
2033-164915-0006 THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED THE CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO ACCORDINGLY SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE STOCKER TILL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRDING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
2033-164915-0007 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE STALKER GIRDED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING OH WOULD I KNEW WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM

2033-164915-0011 TWAS AS I FEARED THE COMMON ILLS DISCERNING BUT UNTO ALLAH WE ARE ALL RETURNING
2033-164915-0012 THEN THE EUNUCH CRIED ON THE PAGES SAYING TAKE HIM OFF THE ASS

2033-164915-0014 SO FARE YE FORWARDS NO HARM SHALL BEFALL YOU TILL YE JOIN HIS GRAND WAZIR DANDAN
2033-164915-0015 THEN HE BADE HIM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO THE AMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO KING OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND THE TRIBUTE OF SYRIA
2033-164915-0016 SO IT WAS AGREED THAT WE GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARKAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHER'S REALM
2033-164915-0017 AND AMONGST THEM WERE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE CADET ZAU AL MAKAN FOR QUOTH THEY HIS NAME BE LIGHT OF THE PLACE AND HE HATH A SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN IS THE DELIGHT OF THE TIME BUT THEY SET OUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOR ALHIJAZ AND NONE WOTTETH WHAT IS BECOME OF THEM
2033-164916-0000 SO HE TURNED TO THE WAZIR DANDAN AND SAID TO HIM VERILY YOUR TALE IS A WONDER OF WONDERS
2033-164916-0001 KNOW O CHIEF WAZIR THAT HERE WHERE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED ME ALLAH HATH GIVEN YOU REST FROM FATIGUE AND BRINGETH YOU YOUR DESIRE AFTER THE EASIEST OF FASHIONS FOR THAT HIS ALMIGHTY WILL RESTORETH TO YOU ZAUMA KHAN AND HIS SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN
2033-164916-0002 WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAIN TELL ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFELL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
2033-164916-0003 ZAUMA KHAN BOWED HIS HEAD AWHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THE POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELLED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM ON THE RIGHT WAY
2033-164916-0004 THEN HE ADDED O MY UNCLE HOW SHALL I DO WITH MY BROTHER SHARRKAN
2033-164916-0005 AFTER A WHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE POOL TIDE SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
2033-164916-0006 IT WAS THE SEVENTY EIGHTH NIGHT
2033-164916-0007 AND IN IT ALL REJOICED AT THE ACCESSION OF THE LIGHTS OF THE PLACE
2033-164916-0008 LASTLY THE MINISTER WENT IN AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE ZAU AL MAKAN WHO ROSE TO MEET HIM SAYING WELCOME O WAZIR AND SIRE'S SONS
2033-164916-0009 MOREOVER THE SULTAN COMMANDED HIS WAZIR DANDAN CALLED A TEN DAYS HALT OF THE ARMY THAT HE MIGHT BE PRIVATE WITH HIM AND LEARN FROM HIM HOW AND WHEREFORE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN SLAIN

2414-128291-0000 WHAT HAS HAPPENED UNTO ME
2414-128291-0001 HE ASKED HIMSELF SOMETHING WARM AND LIVING QUICKENETH ME IT MUST BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
2414-128291-0002 WHEN HOWEVER ZATHUSTRA WAS QUITE NIGH UNTO THEM THEN DID HE HEAR PLAINLY THAT A HUMAN VOICE SPAKE IN THE MIDST OF THE CANE AND APPARENTLY ALL OF THEM HAD TURNED THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THE SPEAKER

2414-128291-0019 THEY ALSO ABSTAIN FROM ALL HEAVY THOUGHTS WHICH INFLATE THEIR HEART
2414-128291-0020 THEN
2414-128291-0021 SAID ZARATHUSTRA THOU SHOULDST ALSO SEE MINE ANIMALS MINE EAGLE AND MY SERPENT THE LIKE DO NOT AT PRESENT EXIST ON EARTH
2414-128291-0022 AND TALK TO MY ANIMALS OF THE HAPPINESS OF ANIMALS
2414-128291-0023 NOW HOWEVER TAKE LEAVE AT ONCE OF THEIR KIND THOU STRANGE ONE

2414-128292-0008 ALSO METHINKETH THAT AFTER ALL IT HATH LONGER LESS THAN MINE
2414-128292-0009 FOR WHEN THE ATUSTRA SCRUTINISED HIM WITH HIS GLANCE HE WAS FRIGHTENED AS BY A SUDDEN APPARITION SO SLENDER SWARTHY HOLLOW AND WORN OUT DID HIS FOLLOWER APPEAR

2414-128292-0018 THAT ONLY DID I HIT THE TRUTH
2414-128292-0019 HOW HAVE I STILL INCLINATIONS
2414-128292-0020 HAD I STILL A GIRL
2414-128292-0021 A HAVEN TOWARD WHICH MY SAIL IS SET

2414-128292-0023 O ETERNAL EVERYWHERE OH ETERNAL NOWHERE O ETERNAL IN VAIN
2414-128292-0024 THOU ART THY SHADOW
2414-128292-0025 SAYS HE AT LAST SADLY
2414-128292-0026 THY DANGER IS NOT SMALL THOU FREE SPIRIT AND WARNER
2414-128292-0027 THEY SLEEP QUIETLY THEY ENJOY THE NEW SECURITY
2414-128292-0028 BEWARE LEST IN THE END A NARROW FATE CAPTURE THEE A HARD RIGOROUS DELUSION
2414-128292-0029 FOR NOW EVERY THING THAT IS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTETH THEE
2414-128292-0030 THOU HADT LOST THY GOAL
2414-128292-0031 THOU POOR ROVER AND RUMBLER THOU TIRED BUTTERFLY
2414-128292-0032 WILT THOU HAVE A REST IN A HOME THIS EVENING
2414-159411-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAMIN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM
2414-159411-0001 THE BRAMIN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THE CAGE YOU WILL EAT ME
2414-159411-0002 OH FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN TRUTH THAT I WILL NOT
2414-159411-0003 I WILL NOT BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND RETURN
2414-159411-0004 THEN THE BRAMIN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARDS
2414-159411-0005 SO THE BRAHMIN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A ABANDONED TREE AND THE BRAHMIN SAID TO IT BANNANT TREE BANNON TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0006 ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE BENDING TREE
2414-159411-0007 THIS TIGER SAID THE BRAMIN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF HIS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LEFT HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME
2414-159411-0008 IT IS JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NOT
2414-159411-0009 LET THE TIGER EAT A MAN FOR MEN ARE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE
2414-159411-0010 SIR CAMEL SIR CAMEL CRIED THE BRAHMIN HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0011 AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND A BULLOCK LYING BY THE ROAD SIDE
2414-159411-0012 IS IT FAIR HE SHOULD DO SO OR NOT
2414-159411-0013 LET THE TIGER EAT THAT MAN FOR MEN HAVE NO PITY
2414-159411-0014 THREE OUT OF THE SIX AND GIVING JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMIN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINE TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
2414-159411-0015 ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKS THE EAGLE
2414-159411-0016 THE BRAHMAN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONES
2414-159411-0017 THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID JUDGMENT OF ALL IS AGAINST YOU O BRAHMAN
2414-159411-0018 AFTER THIS THEY SAW AN ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMIN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVORABLE VERDICT
2414-159411-0019 BUT THE ALLIGATORS SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KILL ME
2414-159411-0020 THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINIONS OF THE SIXTH JUDGE
2414-159411-0021 NOW THE SIXTH WAS A JACKAL
2414-159411-0022 THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKO UNCLE JACKAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0023 SHOW ME THE PACE
2414-159411-0024 AND THE GUARD THERE THE JACKAL SAID NOW BRAHMIN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD
2414-159411-0025 EXACTLY THERE WAS IT ASKED A JACKAL
2414-159411-0026 EXACTLY HERE REPLIED THE BRAMIN
2414-159411-0027 WHERE WAS A TIGER THEN
2414-159411-0028 WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE DAGGER JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON THIS SIDE
2414-159411-0029 VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL BUT I CAN NOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY
2414-159411-0030 SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE BRAMIN
2414-159411-0031 THAN SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0032 WHEN THE BRAHMIN HAD DONE THIS THE JACKALS SAID OH YOU WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL TIGER
2414-159411-0033 WHEN A GOOD BRAHMIN OPENED YOUR CASE DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WOULD MAKE
2414-159411-0034 PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEY PRINCE BRAHMAN
2414-159411-0035 YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY AND MINE THIS
2414-165385-0000 THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUETTE AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLATTERING POCAMP BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILIZED MONKEY
2414-165385-0001 THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS INTENSED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMIC WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU
2609-156975-0000 THE MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN
2609-156975-0001 HOWDORNE HOPHAEST HODOUBT PAT SINCE HIS GENIUS
2609-156975-0002 LET'S HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MATRON MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET US DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
2609-156975-0003 THE EGYPTIAN BACK GROUND OF THE BONDAGE
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHOSE TURBANT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KIERNAPATH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIANS AND SCRIPZONS GIVE OF THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF THE DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ALTAMI CORVETS INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES PROBABLY TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDO WERE THE CHIEF FACTORS IN ITS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
2609-156975-0008 THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATION OF A SOJOURN IN EGYPT
2609-156975-0009 THE LATER TRADITIONS SEEMED TO EXTEND THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY PATAM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATOM
2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY IN SCRIPS AND ULSTER STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHAM THE HOUSE OF RAMESES A CITY WITH THE ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES
2609-156975-0012 THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS TYRANNY WAS NATURALLY INEVITABLE
2609-156975-0013 WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM IT THE DESPOTIC ROAR OF THAT LANDEN DAY
2609-156975-0014 THE MAKING OF THE LOYAL PATRIOT
2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES'S BIRTH IN EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
2609-156975-0016 WITH MOSES JUST FINDIN RESISTIN THE GYPSIN TACT MASTER
2609-156975-0017 IS PENIONAGE ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
2609-156975-0018 NAT'RY HE WENT TO THE LAND OF MIDIAN
2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTS AND FUGITIVES
2609-156975-0020 FROM ABOUT TWO HUNDRED B C
2609-156975-0021 ON THE BORDER OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
2609-156975-0022 THESE LAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KIDAM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN THAT TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0024 THE SCORE OF THE WORTHINESS
2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUETTE
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIEST OF THE SUBTRIBE OF THE KINNITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0027 NOTE THE CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF MARRIAGES
2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS A LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KINITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAWAY OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GUIDE WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0031 DO THE EARLIEST HEBREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0032 THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIESTS MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0033 MOSES IN THE HOME OF THE MIDIAN PRIEST WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0034 THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE HIS TRAINING
2609-156975-0035 HIS QUEST WAS FOR A JUTS AND STRONG GUN ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENS HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON A POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST AND TONIAN PLAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA MINOR CYRIL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVING SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
2609-156975-0038 THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES'S CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP IN ACTION
2609-157645-0000 EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PLEASANT FOR THE ROYAL FOE OF TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
2609-157645-0001 THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGUISING QUOTE AT A SMOKING IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
2609-157645-0002 SOMETIMES TOBACCO IS USED IN CHURCH FOR DISINFECTANT OR DEODORIZING PURPOSES
2609-157645-0003 BLACKBURN ARTS BICEIP OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER
2609-157645-0004 ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH NOTTINGHAM FOR A CONFIRM MASON
2609-157645-0005 ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER DIDNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTRY AT HATTON
2609-157645-0006 PAR WAS SUCH A CONTINUOUS SMOKER THAT ANY ONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HADN'T NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF A PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENSE
2609-157645-0007 ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITSFIELD HE HANDED MASTER PIPE AND CHANCELLOR THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING EM PATIENT
2609-157645-0008 THEM THEM SING ANOTHER PSALM SAID THE CURATE
2609-157645-0009 THEY HAVE SIR RETURNED THE CLERK
2609-157645-0010 THEN LET THEM SING THE HUNDRED NINETEENTH REPLIED THE CURATE
2609-157645-0011 SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AS MANY TOBACCO PIPES TO THE MAN OF OFFICE
2609-157645-0012 DAVID DEANE SAVOR DENIED THAT ALL PROVED THIS IRREVERENCE
2609-157645-0013 GOING TO CHURCH SAINT HALE'S IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN A QUAINT IN THE SIGNING EXPERIENCE
2609-157645-0014 WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND OUT THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
2609-169640-0000 PARROTS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY THE SYPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE SEEST FOUR OF THEM AND FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE
2609-169640-0001 AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JUST KEPT THE STEERAGE WAY ON THE SHIP
2609-169640-0002 FORTUNATELY THE JOHN WAS NOT ONLY FAT BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS A LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS IN UNLIVELY DANCE
2609-169640-0003 I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SIP POST HE SPECTS EE IN MODERATE WEATHER
2609-169640-0004 MISTER MARBLE HE I DO B'LIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HINCOOPS BEING LIKE THE SAILORS AS ONE MIGHT SAY VERY ASLEEP
2609-169640-0005 AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE WELL FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN THE BOAT
2609-169640-0006 I SING OUT SAIL HO AND CLOSE ABROAD
2609-169640-0007 HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMEN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
2609-169640-0008 ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET TO TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
2609-169640-0009 AS OUR SEATS WERE OFF FLYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT
2609-169640-0010 I SOON SAW BOTH BRONTZ AND GLAD ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER
2609-169640-0011 MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS ALSO AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCAL'S ABACK
2609-169640-0012 A BRIEF STILLNESS SUCCEEDED
2609-169640-0013 THE PROTES DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED IT FAST
2609-169640-0014 I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING HEIGHTS TOO AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
2609-169640-0015 KATE WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
2609-169640-0016 THE STILLNESS THAT RAINED ON BOTH SIDES WAS LIKE THAT OF DEATH
2609-169640-0017 THE GIANT BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME ROUND LIKE A TOP
2609-169640-0018 THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER WE SHOULD PASS THEM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
2609-169640-0019 THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INCIDENT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE IN THE CLOSEST ATTENTION TO HIS ORDERS
2609-169640-0020 NOT A SOUL ON BOARD THE KING WAS HURT
2609-169640-0021 ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMEN THE FOUR SIXES TWO AT THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERNMOST PROWA WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
2609-169640-0022 THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN ANGUISHS
2609-169640-0023 I DOUBT IF WE'D TOUCH THE MAN IN THE NEAREST BOROUGH
2609-169640-0024 IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD OF HER CANVAS'S BINNED FORE LEAVING THE POORER MOSTCENOUS IN HER WAKE
3005-163389-0000 THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHIRBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF FOR THE NOISE
3005-163389-0001 SOMEONE SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEAR DOWN THE FENCE
3005-163389-0002 THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPING AND UNCOMFORTABLE
3005-163389-0003 SHERBURN RUN HIS EYE SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUTGAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
3005-163389-0004 THE AVERAGE MAN IS A COWARD
3005-163389-0005 BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THAT MAN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARK AND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
3005-163389-0006 SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH AN HUNDRED MASKED COWARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
3005-163389-0007 YOU DON'T WANT TO COME
3005-163389-0008 BUT A MOB WITHOUT ANY MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT WAS BENEATH PITIFULNESS
3005-163389-0009 NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN ACROSS HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS THIS
3005-163389-0010 THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AND THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AND BUCK HARKNESS HE HEALED IT AFTER THEM LOOKING TOLERABLE CHEAP
3005-163389-0011 HE CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
3005-163389-0012 THEY ARGUED AND TRIED TO KEEP HIM OUT BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE WHOLE SHOW CAME TO A STANDSTILL
3005-163389-0013 AND ONE OR TWO WOMEN BEGIN TO SCREAM
3005-163389-0014 SO THEN THE RING MASTER MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSE
3005-163389-0015 IT WARN'T FUNNY TO ME THOUGH I WAS ALL A TREMBLE TO SEE HIS DANGER
3005-163389-0016 AND THE HORSE A GOIN LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE TOO
3005-163389-0017 HE SHED THEM SO THICK THEY KIND OF CLOGGED UP THE AIR AND ALTOGETHER HE SHED SEVENTEEN SUITS
3005-163389-0018 IT WAS ONE OF HIS OWN MEN
3005-163390-0000 ANN BUT NEVER MIND THE REST OF HIS OUTFIT IT WAS JIST WILD BUT IT WAS AWFUL FUNNY
3005-163390-0001 THE PEOPLE MOST KILLED THEMSELVES LAUGHING AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE CAPERING AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HAW HAWED TILL HE COME BACK AND DONE IT OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM DO IT ANOTHER TIME

3005-163399-0013 PURTY SOON SHE MADE THE COLD CHILL STREAK ALL DOWN MY BACK BECAUSE SHE SAYS
3005-163399-0014 I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEAD I'VE GOT TO THROW UP MY HAND
3005-163399-0015 SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I GOT TO RESK THE TRUTH
3005-163399-0016 I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAID HERE HE COMES
3005-163399-0017 DON'T YOU SAY A WORD
3005-163399-0018 I THINK I WAS IN A FIX NOW
3005-163399-0019 MISSUS PHELPS SHE JUMPS FOR HIM AN SAYS
3005-163399-0020 HAS HE COME NO SAID HER HUSBAND
3005-163399-0021 I CAN'T IMAGINE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MAKES ME DREADFUL UNEASY
3005-163399-0022 UNEASY SHE SAYS I AM READY TO GO DISTRACTED
3005-163399-0023 HE MUST A COME AN YOU'VE MISSED HIM ALONG DE ROAD
3005-163399-0024 OH DON'T DISTRESS ME ANY MORE'N I AM ALREADY DISTRESSED
3005-163399-0025 WHY SILAS LOOK YONDER UP THE ROAD AIN'T THAT SOMEBODY COMIN
3005-163399-0026 THE OLD GENTLEMAN STARED AND SAID
3005-163399-0027 I HAINT NO IDEA WHO IS IT
3005-163399-0028 IT IS TOM SAWYER
3005-163399-0029 BING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGHIN ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
3005-163399-0030 THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES DOWN ON THE BOAT
3080-5032-0000 I AM HUGELY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MY LADY
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN THE WORST OF HER
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUMOR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
3080-5032-0003 WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND THE GARLAND
3080-5032-0004 WELL THE BEST ON'T IS THAT I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND ON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGEST
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITH ALL AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULTS AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
3080-5032-0008 TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I'M VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS A SQUIRE OF DAME'S AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND TO SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0010 I THINK MY YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH THEM
3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUTS THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAVE BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0014 BESIDES I CAN GIVE YOU OTHERS
3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNTS AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0016 YOU WOULD THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY SCAPE IT
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMOURS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBOURS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WAS FIT FOR YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU CAN
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE INTEREST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE AND MUCH MORE CALMLY
3080-5032-0024 AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARNT IT SINCE
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM CHEEK MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETER'S
3080-5032-0026 HOW KINDLY DO I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHER'S IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
3080-5040-0000 IT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR ANNE DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMAGE
3080-5040-0003 I WONDERED HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE IN IT BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0005 TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING TO BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTERS TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANY THING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
3080-5040-0008 MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGO THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED
3080-5040-0009 YOU SEE I GAVE YOU FAIR WARNING
3080-5040-0010 BY THE NEXT I SHALL BE GONE TO KENT AND MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR INTERCOURSE VERY MUCH
3080-5040-0011 HERE ARE SOME VERSES OF CAROLLES TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE THEM
3080-5040-0012 I TOLD YOU IN MY LAST THAT MY SUFFOLK JOURNEY WAS LAID ASIDE AND THAT TO KENT HASTENED
3080-5040-0013 IF I DROWNED BY THE WAY THIS WILL BE MY LAST LETTER AND LIKE A WILL I BEQUEATH ALL MY KINDNESS TO YOU IN IT WITH A CHARGE NEVER TO BESTOW IT ALL UPON ANOTHER MISTRESS LEST MY GHOST RISE AGAIN AND HAUNT YOU
3080-5040-0014 INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS COMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUDGE OF A MOST EXCELLENT SERVANT AND FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE
3080-5040-0015 BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKELY TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT INTEND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
3080-5040-0016 I DO NOT FIND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVE YOU LOVED ME
3080-5040-0017 BUT I AM CALLED ON
3080-5040-0018 DIRECTLY FOR YOUR MASTER
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHIT WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTH THAN THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING IT
3080-5040-0021 YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE AT THIS THAT I ESCAPE DROWNING
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I READ BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0023 HOW WELCOME YOU WOULD BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DELAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGH TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS WHEN WE HAVE TIME
3080-5040-0027 WELL IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
3080-5040-0028 WOULD YOU BE SO GOOD NATURED
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS THE FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THE AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU WITH DISCOURSES OF THE FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER OCCASION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OFF HER AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO SEE WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEAS CART WITH NINE PEAS IN IT UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PATTY INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
3331-159605-0001 THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MORE CREDITED
3331-159605-0002 I'VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT'S TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES
3331-159605-0004 A SPITEFUL THING I AM
3331-159605-0005 I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 LET ME SEE HOW I BEGIN
3331-159605-0007 HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAD A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENT OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MAN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERYONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARD POLLY AND IT FLATTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON OR EVEN GRATITUDE
3331-159605-0014 POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATIONS WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BACKY AND BESS BUT COULD NOT RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FANNY THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DUCK BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASSA CHARLIE'S HAND MISS MAMMY AND WALK PRETTY LIKE BILLY AND FLOSSIE SAID THE MAID
3331-159605-0019 AT A STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOLBOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COLD AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULD NOT HELP IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE ROS ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT THIS FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOESN'T IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0025 THANK YOU
3331-159605-0026 HOW LOVELY THAT PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING THE TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS HE RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
3331-159605-0029 SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BUOYANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I AM GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WILD LIKE LEVERLY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AS SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVORITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 WORKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS SHE'LL CHILLED HIM
3331-159605-0035 UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON A SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PUDDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBERS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME A DEAR HAS NOT HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0038 DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANT TO
3331-159605-0039 TRULY JULIE FANN
3331-159605-0040 I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID
3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT THE CHANCE AND I HAVE
3331-159605-0042 I JUST GAVE HIM THE HINT AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THEY THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT SIDDY TATTLERS SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHANDLAYMAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0046 I'M ODD YOU KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WIDEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERYONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTING THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED UNTIL HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKED TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NO I'M ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU ARE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I TRIED NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0008 THANK HEAVEN FOR THIS
3331-159609-0009 SAID POLLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0010 POOR BILLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELLTE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKINGLY I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BEFORE
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER IN ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATED THEIR RESPECTIVE VIRTUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID ANNIE TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BAD THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINTER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SIDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE A HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING A BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORES
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HERS SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT HIM IN UTTER DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 FANNY CAME IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
3528-168656-0000 SHE HAD BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN THESE NAMES UPON EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR THAT SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUCEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUCIBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOLGIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS THE CENTURY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF PONTREVAL DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0006 SHE WOULD NOT SHOW THIS OBJECT TO ANYONE
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENTION
3528-168656-0008 SOME UNIQUE CHAPLET SOME AUTHENTIC RELIQUE
3528-168656-0009 THEY LOST THEMSELVES IN CONJECTURE
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT THE DANCER IS LAUGHING WITH A SATANNICAL AIR
3528-168656-0012 MORAL LOVE CONQUERED BY A COLIC
3528-168669-0000 THE PRIORESS RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE IN HER CHAIR
3528-168669-0001 WE WILL PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0002 FATHER FAUENT
3528-168669-0003 REVEREND MOTHER DO YOU KNOW THAT CHAPEL
3528-168669-0004 YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
3528-168669-0005 THERE IS A STONE TO BE RAISED
3528-168669-0006 THIS SLAP OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0007 THIS SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT YES
3528-168669-0008 IT WILL BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR IT
3528-168669-0009 A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DAM BABYLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLONUS HORSEES ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERLINUS HORSEES NEITHER DO I
3528-168669-0011 MERIT CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCK YARD
3528-168669-0012 AND A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS A STRONG ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0013 AND CAN YOU GET THE LEVER
3528-168669-0014 THERE IS A RING ON THE STONE
3528-168669-0015 I WILL PUT THE LEVER THROUGH
3528-168669-0016 IT IS GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I WILL OPEN THE VAULT
3528-168669-0017 WILL THAT BE ALL

3528-168669-0019 FOUVENT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
3528-168669-0020 I AM HERE TO DO ANY THING YOU WISH

3528-168669-0028 THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN MY DIRECTION THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0029 IT WAS ANOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER
3528-168669-0031 THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS IN THE CHURCH I KNOW
3528-168669-0032 A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE ROOM MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0033 AY MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0034 WHAT YOU SAY

3528-168669-0037 I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN

3528-168669-0043 FATHER FAUIN THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0044 SHE REGAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT
3528-168669-0045 SHE GAVE US HER LAST COMMAND
3528-168669-0046 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HERSEL SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0047 THERE IS SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT DEATH
3528-168669-0048 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT IT WAS AN ORISON WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING
3528-168669-0049 FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE HE WENT ON
3528-168669-0050 I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABORING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT
3528-168669-0051 FORTUNATELY THE PRIZE COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT

3528-168669-0069 HE ASKED IT OF US THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDED US
3528-168669-0070 IT IS FORBIDDEN
3528-168669-0071 I AM A STONE IN YOUR WALLS

3528-168669-0130 I WILL MAKE IT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS OF PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THAT SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUITS GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROBABLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAD NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0008 SEVENTEEN NINETY NINE
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON WHY THE FOOD IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WILL BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHOPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMBS AND FRUIT PASTE ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR SIXTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVED MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONERY SIXTEEN O EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONCET TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED ON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHIONS AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 IS
3538-142836-0024 AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES WERE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THIS SPATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PRODUCE INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME SAID THE HEAD
3538-163619-0004 WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FOR THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE LAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG THE CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY BROTHERS SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHENMAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE WORKED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH A COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHIE BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOLDS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE HOLES AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCH FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 AND THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME HITHER COME HITHER MY SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN A CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD IN HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SYDDER LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDER LAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I'M WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID SINDER LAD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID SINDER LADD
3538-163622-0014 AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARD A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANY THING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID SINDER LADD
3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKED LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SINDERD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE'S A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE SOUL SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FOAL DOST THOU NOT SEE ANY THING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS THE RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDERLAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE ON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
3538-163624-0003 SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING INTO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES TO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU ARE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REGAN MADE A SWORD AND SIGUR TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S PLATE AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGURD SAID THE SWORD WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO THE CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED UNTIL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRES
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FAFNER AND THEN STAFFNER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFFNER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNER ON THE STEAK AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINGFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL WEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF THE KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 LYN BRUNHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUNDRON WERE BATHING BRUNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRON'S SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAMES WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID UNTIL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
367-130732-0000 LOBSTERS IN LOBSTERS
367-130732-0001 WHEN IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IS A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMARY OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOUR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN
367-130732-0004 A BOOK WOULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD WIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER ALE NEWBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DOMONICO

367-130732-0012 I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COASTS IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUSLY AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
367-130732-0013 GOBY'S PASS WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBIES BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PRESTIGE DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
367-130732-0015 GOBYS CRAB STEW
367-130732-0016 TAKE THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT ALL THE FAT FROM A SHELL

367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE PISKIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH BETTER WILL GULPED IT DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER
367-293981-0014 IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT RETURNED SANCHO WOE BETIDE ME IN ALL MY KINDRED WHY DID YOU LET ME TASTE IT
367-293981-0015 SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THIS KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU BY THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOU SATISFACTION IN REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRE
367-293981-0016 THIS IS AN INN SAID DON QUIXOTE
367-293981-0017 AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE SAID THE INN KEEPER
367-293981-0018 THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLANKETED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW VENTURE WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS SQUIRE WHO UTTERED THEM
367-293981-0019 HE SAW THEM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
367-293981-0020 SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK IT NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THE BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
3764-168670-0000 THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
3764-168670-0001 JOSEPH HAD WAKED UP
3764-168670-0002 JEAN VALJEAN HAS PLACED HER NEAR THE FIRE
3764-168670-0003 YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE I SHALL COME TO FETCH YE
3764-168670-0004 EVERY THING IS ARRANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
3764-168670-0005 I HAVE PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE OUT
3764-168670-0006 THAT'S WHERE THE DIFFICULTIES LIES
3764-168670-0007 IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH A CHILD YOU WILL CARRY HER OUT
3764-168670-0008 AND SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE I ANSWERED FOR THAT
3764-168670-0009 FAUCHELEVENT GRUBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN VALJEAN
3764-168670-0010 YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELEINE THAT GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE IT
3764-168670-0011 JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND THOUGHT HE WAS RAVEN
3764-168670-0012 FAUCHELEV WENT ON
3764-168670-0013 IT IS TOMORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECTS YOU
3764-168670-0014 THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR THE SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE COMMUNITY
3764-168670-0015 THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
3764-168670-0016 THAT THE PRIORESS AND THE VOCAL MOTHERS INTENDED TO FULFILL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
3764-168670-0017 THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN A CELL RAISE THE STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
3764-168670-0018 AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER THE EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0019 WHAT WAS THAT EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0020 ASKED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENT
3764-168670-0021 WAT COFFIN WHAT ADMINISTRATION
3764-168670-0022 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER HIS CHAIR
3764-168670-0023 YOU KNOW FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID FATHER CRUCIFIXION IS DEAD
3764-168670-0024 AND I ADD AND FATHER MADELEINE IS BURIED
3764-168670-0025 YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN FATHER MADELAINE
3764-168670-0026 THAT OFFERS THE MEANS GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
3764-168670-0027 HOW LONG IS THAT COFFIN SIX FEET
3764-168670-0028 IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0029 THE CHURCH IN THE STREET THO THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
3764-168670-0030 HAVE YOU THE KEY TO THOSE TWO DOORS
3764-168670-0031 I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKER MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET THE COFFIN
3764-168670-0033 WHO NAILS UP THE COFFIN
3764-168670-0034 WHO SPREADS THE PAW OVER IT
3764-168670-0035 NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER THE ROOM THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
3764-168670-0036 COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THAT ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN EVERYONE IS ASLEEP
3764-168670-0037 AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3764-168670-0038 I SHALL BE HUNGRY AND I WILL BRING YOU SOMETHING
3764-168670-0039 YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME IN THE COFFIN AT TWO O'CLOCK
3764-168670-0040 FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS FINGER JOINTS BUT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
3764-168670-0041 BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS AND A PLANK
3764-168670-0042 JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAIT THAN THIS
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONSTRUCT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
3764-168670-0044 WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF THE CURE
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMISE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE ROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANCON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0047 THE MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE
3764-168670-0048 WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO THE CAT DO COME IN
3764-168670-0049 THE OVERRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
3764-168670-0050 BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COLDNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU'RE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
3764-168670-0052 AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVEDIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0053 I SHOULD FOLLOW THAT IS MY BUSINESS
3764-168670-0054 THE HEARSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKERS MEN KNOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0055 THE PRIEST SAID THE PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL BE SOBER
3764-168670-0057 THAT IS SETTLED SAID FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL GO WELL
3764-168671-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAINS PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEARS
3764-168671-0001 THE HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
3764-168671-0002 THE MORNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
3764-168671-0003 BEHIND IT CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABOURER WHO LIMPED ALONG
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING AND SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALID
3764-168671-0006 DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT THE FLOWERS WERE DESERTING
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VAUGIRARD IT HINTED AT POVERTY PER LA CHAISE IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHEISE IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0009 THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN INTO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENSE IN OUR SIGHT
3764-168671-0010 IT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLES A DUTY
3764-168671-0011 THE NUNS HAD PERMITTED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
3764-168671-0012 IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0013 MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MAN BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES
3764-168671-0014 A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPLE
3764-168671-0015 FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BESIDE THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0016 JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0017 WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS MERE NOTHING
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER ME
3764-168671-0019 HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH THEM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
3764-168671-0020 THE COMMISSION FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0022 A MAN REPLIED THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0023 THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0024 YOU
3764-168671-0025 FATHER MESTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
3764-168671-0026 FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED NOTHING BUT THIS BUT A GRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE
3764-168671-0027 IT'S TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIGGERS DO DIE THEMSELVES
3764-168671-0028 HE HAD HARDLY STRENGTH TO STAMMER
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER MASTIEN IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LINNOIR IS HERE'S A JUG OF RED WINE
3764-168671-0031 BUT YOU ARE A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
3764-168671-0032 YOU NOT COMRADE WE'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
3764-168671-0033 THE MAN RETURNED
3764-168671-0034 HE LEAPED MORE OUT OF ANXIETY THAN FROM INFIRMITY
3764-168671-0035 THE GRAVEDIGGER WALKED ON IN FRONT OF HIM
3764-168671-0036 FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED CREAVIER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER HE MUTTERED
3764-168671-0038 MONSIEUR FATHER MATHIER IS DEAD
3764-168671-0039 THE MAN REPLIED
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTEBOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MASTIENNE'S TURN FATHER MASTIENNE DIED
3764-168671-0041 STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT IS MADE
3764-168671-0042 YOU ARE A POET I AM A PARISIAN
3764-168671-0043 FAUCHELEVENT I AM LOST
3764-168671-0044 THERE WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUNS CORNER
3764-168671-0045 AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE PRETINNIUM TOWN HALL
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES OF CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0049 SO YOU'RE NOT A GRAVE DIGGER THEN
3764-168671-0050 RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT HIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS
3764-168671-0051 HERE THE REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY
3764-168671-0052 FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON THE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053 THE GRAVEDIGGER WENT ON WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE
3764-168671-0054 ONE MUST EAT IT
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I WAKE
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALWAYS ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT
3997-180294-0002 WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DID
3997-180294-0005 NOW I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THE SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNSEL OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS THE TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE THE CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VEIL
3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HAVE BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
3997-180294-0011 THEY LOVED BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAS NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0013 THEY KNEW NOT WHAT PROOF TO GIVE
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABORERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0015 THAT IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVE SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAISSON
3997-180294-0018 WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAYETY
3997-180294-0019 THE WOMAN BECOMES A MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 HOW
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED IN JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY ORDERS TONIGHT AT THE VAUDEVILLE
3997-180294-0023 COME DURING THE THIRD ENTRACT
3997-180294-0024 THE BOXES CLOSED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY A STAGE BOX
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPENED AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0027 DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHALL BE
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TONIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 YOU SHALL GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0030 WHEN AT HOME
3997-180294-0031 YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU
3997-180294-0032 BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING THEM
3997-180294-0033 NEVERTHELESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0000 I HAVE COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
3997-180297-0001 YOU'RE IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE
3997-180297-0003 DURING THIS REMARK MARGARET LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY
3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DO NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MAY DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
3997-180297-0007 IS THAT THE ONLY REASON
3997-180297-0008 IF THERE WERE ANY OTHERS I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
3997-180297-0009 HONESTLY YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
3997-180297-0010 I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED UPON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0011 WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS ARE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
3997-180297-0012 I WHISPERED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRE AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER THE PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 WE NO LONGER BELONGED TO OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017 WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR ESTEEM LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 DO THEY GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATER
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AN OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0021 I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH SHE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVED AND KNEW WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT A MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH HIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0024 MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TOMORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
3997-180297-0025 MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID
3997-180297-0026 THERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK
3997-180297-0027 I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT ME
3997-180297-0028 LOOK HERE PRUDENCE YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID MARGUERITE
3997-180297-0029 HE WANTS YOU TO FORGET HIM
3997-180297-0030 ONE HAS TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT
3997-180297-0031 I EMBRACED MARGUERITE TILL SHE WAS ALMOST STIFLED
3997-182399-0000 MISTER BUZZARD GRINNED
3997-182399-0001 THAT SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER STORY
3997-182399-0002 HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACKHEADED COUSIN OF OLD MISTER BUZZARD VERY CURIOUS INDEED
3997-182399-0003 ANY WAY HE WOULD FIND OUT

4198-12281-0005 LORD GOD DA ME HE POTUM
4198-12281-0006 LET HIM BE CARRIED TO PRISON FOR TROUBLING THE DIVINE SERVICES
4198-12281-0007 WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN THE ADVENT IN ALL THE WINTER
4198-12281-0008 HARK YOU MY MASTERS YOU THAT LOVE THE WINE COPSE BODY FOLLOW ME FOR SAINT ANTHONY BURNED ME AS FREELY AS A FAGGOT THEY GET LEAVE TO TASTE ONE DROP OF THE LIQUOR THAT WILL NOT NOW COME AND FIGHT FOR RELIEF OF THE VINE
4198-12281-0009 TO OTHERS AGAIN HE UNJOINTED THE SPINDELLS OR KNUCKLES OF THE NECK DISFIGURED THEIR CHAPS GHASHED THEIR FACES MADE THEIR CHEEKS HANG FLAPPING ON THEIR CHIN AND SO SWINGED AND BELAMMED THEM THAT THEY FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM LIKE HAY BEFORE HIM MORE
4198-12281-0010 TO SOME WITH THEIR SMART SOUS ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDRIFT WAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOME PUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
4198-12281-0011 BELIEVED THAT IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER ONE SAW
4198-12281-0012 O THE HOLY LADY NITTI SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTUS O OUR LADY OF SUCCOURS SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP
4198-12281-0013 SOME DIED WITHOUT SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE WITHOUT DYING SOME DIED IN SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE AND DYING
4198-12281-0014 CAN YOU TELL WITH WHAT INSTRUMENTS THEY DO IT
4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEANTIME FRIAR JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVORED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNEXION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHER BY THE ADHERENCE OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SHADURUS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
4198-61336-0003 TIGLATH PELISER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE EURIAN ARMY IN CUMAC
4198-61336-0004 A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF ITS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING CHARDORUS WHO LEAPT FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST EUROPE ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0007 THE SIFTI MATTI ILU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT CHARDORUS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TIGLATH BELEZER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERNLAND WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0010 ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATILLIU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE HEROES CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA
4198-61336-0012 THIS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 JEHOAS THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARD HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHELAM
4198-61336-0015 THE USURPER HELD SWAY AT SUMERIA FOR ONLY A MONTH
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MENEHEIM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0017 TEGLATH PALLISER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTH EAST
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOT PUT INTO THE SWARD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS URRATU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLATH BILLIZER RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0021 MINUHEIM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PEGAHIAH
4198-61336-0022 JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITION IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT ITS INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0023 HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR HIS IDOLATRIES AND CRIED
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YE ME AND YE SHALL LIVE HAVE YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS OF HOUSE OF ISRAEL
4198-61336-0025 THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES WILL PERISH
4198-61336-0026 ISRAEL IS ALSO DEALT WITH
4198-61336-0027 IT SWEPT THROUGH ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0028 THE PHILISTINES AND ARABIANS OF THE DESERT WERE ALSO SUBDUED
4198-61336-0029 THEY INVADED BABYLONIA
4198-61336-0030 UGENZER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITOLIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0000 AS I THOUGHT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGNS IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME ERROR
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BENELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR IF HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0005 I ASK NO FURTHER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLKS THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FAVOR TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0008 I BEGGED HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM I HAD NEVER TAKEN IN
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GIORGIO DE CORTONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0010 GEORGIO CAME FOR THEM HIS HEALTH
4294-14317-0011 I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THE SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUC ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LANDI WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGELO
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND BE ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTOR'S CRAFT
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK ON THE PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-14317-0016 AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE SCULPTOR
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FOR THE NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE AND HEART I REACHED MY HOME
4294-32859-0000 WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADY HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISSUS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDALIN AND RETCH'S PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU A STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THE OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGET THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SON WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU AS SWORD HE QUOTH
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDENS SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRID HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN THE DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULD'ST REND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE SUNLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDERS THE OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US FROM OGRE'S MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILL STONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILST I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY HIS FREEDOM
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEY HOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME TILL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HANDS AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCESS HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING ROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME SAID THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLES SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRID'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT ETHELRED HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE ISOUDE
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THAT MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED THE FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE RECOGNIZED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHT OF DOUBT PAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FARTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0008 THIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDE OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON ECHOED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUESTS COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAYS COURFEYRAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER GOLD HERE IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND COAT AND MY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT YOU DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 YOU KNOW GERMAN NO
4294-9934-0019 IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 A CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKERS
4294-9934-0022 HE BOUGHT A WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HULLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID UPON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAD TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WOULD BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLS THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH THE RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THE MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MEN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE STARTED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST PITY
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERY THING
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THAT QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT ON WITH A SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDST OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALNUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
4350-10919-0009 YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCE AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKI BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE ON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED AH
4350-10919-0012 WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW ABOUT THE TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED IS A MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH FOR LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0015 THE DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES
4350-10919-0017 THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET EM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 O TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCES A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DOCTOR THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU HAVE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENSE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAVE FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED IN DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM AT ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMS AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-9170-0001 THAT IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTEREST OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 A MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE PARTY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAD ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THE ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010 IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANISATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN AND POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS REDUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPIRE PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0017 THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE INSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MAN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FARTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIME SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 SO IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS UPON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUND ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN UPON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOUR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBOURING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF THE GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES AND CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAD BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBOURS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE'S SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF A STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAID WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGIOUS EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THAT STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MAN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBOURS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBOURS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WOULD NEED INFINITE THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AND OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WOULD BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 YOU KNOW SOMETHING
4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CARJACK AND SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 NO WHO NEEDS THE JOB BAN THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS
4852-28311-0003 OH K HE SAID
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK THEM YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT ON EM STREET
4852-28311-0006 WELL HE ADMITTED I DO
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITH HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 I THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BITCHER AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED TO HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE CORNER
4852-28311-0013 AH SHUCKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK AT A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON TO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THAT JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERY THING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED A HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY HORSES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAMES STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0025 HOW DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARHORN WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW IN THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0003 HEAVY HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0004 MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARDS THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WAS THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0007 CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YET THEY WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0008 CHRIS SWALLOWED BUT HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
4852-28312-0009 YES SIR HE SAYS
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIGNS AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0011 HE IS A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE
4852-28312-0012 JAKIE HARRIS'S NAME IS HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THE ROOM BEYOND
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE THAPHIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018 THE ROOMS SEEMED OVERLY STILL
4852-28312-0019 THEN IN THE SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28312-0020 THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHERE IS THE FREE WAY
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023 WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMP LIT STREETS
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORES HAD STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
4852-28312-0027 THE COURTYARD WAS SPARELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE END OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0029 THE COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLANGED COURTYARD
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE INN AND THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28319-0000 THE LEARNING OF MAGIC IS BY NO MEANS EASY
4852-28319-0001 HE TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSTLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28319-0002 CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHOULD ALL I DO FIRST
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0006 I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK
4852-28319-0007 MISTER WALKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0008 THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WIGGER SAID START AT ONCE
4852-28319-0009 THE SENSATIONS SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT LESS BY
4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR BOOKS ONE THE RETURN
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE AT CURVED UP POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0014 ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS
4852-28319-0015 IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE HIS BOY COME TO LIFE
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOOD FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0017 BUT HOW DID ONE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
4852-28319-0018 CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISSUS WICKER'S DOOR
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY HE RESUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON RAINY BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM
4852-28319-0021 DUSK CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY
4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS ARE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME
4852-28319-0023 MISTER WORKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKE AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCION FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF A NEGRO BOY
4852-28319-0025 WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES THE WIDEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET THE BOUQUET FALL
4852-28330-0000 THEY WENT DOWN TO THE QUARTERS FIRST
4852-28330-0001 MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY HERBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
4852-28330-0004 THE MIRABELLE IS NEARING TAHITI
4852-28330-0005 WE'VE WATER IN FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON THERE
4852-28330-0006 CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED AND HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0007 MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINNELL WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A MOMENT CONSIDERING
4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY THAT I DO
4852-28330-0012 THE SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY
4852-28330-0013 HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM
4852-28330-0014 WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAD
4852-28330-0015 THE SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY
4852-28330-0017 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN HIS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0018 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF A SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0019 CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANYONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0020 WHAT COULD BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS OUGHT TO ASK
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND CREW KNOW IT
4852-28330-0022 I SHALL SAY YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WORKER HAD CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTIONILY ACCOUNTED FOR
4852-28330-0025 THE CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
533-1066-0000 WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAN
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN A BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
533-1066-0002 I AM SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
533-1066-0003 FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR'S HALL IN THE LODGE
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0005 MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TO NIGHT
533-1066-0006 I HAVE NONE I SAID HAPPY
533-1066-0007 I MEAN HE PERSISTED YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL
533-1066-0008 THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEABLE NIGHT
533-1066-0009 SOMETHING WAS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID
533-1066-0010 PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
533-1066-0011 LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
533-1066-0012 THEY WERE TALKING COFIENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
533-1066-0013 THERE WERE FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0014 I ASK NO QUESTIONS
533-1066-0015 ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STEWART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE
533-1066-0016 I HARDLY KNEW WHAT I EXPECTED
533-1066-0017 THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHEN HE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT
533-1066-0018 I CONFESSED THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A CHEERFUL SPOT
533-1066-0019 IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH SHARPLY
533-1066-0020 WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES
533-1066-0021 THE DOCTOR KEPT A KEEN LOOKOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED
533-1066-0022 THERE'S ONE THING SURE I WILL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY
533-1066-0023 A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING THEM UP
533-1066-0024 I HELD ON TO THEM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN
533-131556-0000 BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST ELAPSE BEFORE THEY GO
533-131556-0001 FOR NONE COULD ENDURE ME AS HE HAS DONE
533-131556-0002 THE WORDS STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIMILATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
533-131556-0004 I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD HIM SO MINUTELY
533-131556-0005 THEY HAD OVERTAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK
533-131556-0006 I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT
533-131556-0007 ON PERUSING THIS SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP
533-131556-0008 YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND YOU'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT
533-131556-0009 WILL YOU OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE
533-131556-0010 AH YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS
533-131556-0011 IF I WAS SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE
533-131556-0012 I ENJOY A MOONLIGHT RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESORTS
533-131556-0013 SHE COLORED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER CHEEKS AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
533-131556-0014 I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARD THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
533-131556-0015 YES
533-131556-0016 I DO
533-131556-0017 SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARE NOT SHOW
533-131556-0018 I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MURMURED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
533-131556-0019 IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL RATHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR ADEPTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
533-131556-0020 I SHOULD NOT TELL HIM
533-131556-0021 GIVE ME NO THANKS IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE I REFRAIN
533-131556-0022 AND MILLICENT WILL YOU TELL HER
533-131556-0023 I WOULD NOT FOR MUCH THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF HER RELATIONS
533-131556-0024 YOU USE ODD WORDS MISSUS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU
533-131556-0025 HOW DARED YOU MENTION HIS NAME TO ME
533-131562-0000 IT SEEMS VERY INTERESTING LOVE SAID HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO WHERE I STOOD WRINGING MY HAND IN SILENT RAGE AND ANGUISH BUT IT'S RATHER LONG I'LL LOOK AT IT SOME OTHER TIME AND MEANWHILE I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KISS MY DEAR WHAT KISS
533-131562-0001 THE KEYS OF YOUR CABINET DESK DRAWERS AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
533-131562-0002 THE KEY OF MY VESQUE IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
533-131562-0003 THEN SNEERED HE WE MUST HAVE A CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY
533-131562-0004 AND PUTTING THE KEY INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY
533-131562-0005 AND ALL REPLIED THE MASTER AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
533-131562-0006 MISTER HUNTINGDON THEN WENT UP STAIRS
533-131562-0007 MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE IS VERY DEVIL FOR SPITE
533-131562-0008 I DIDN'T SAY I HAD BROKEN IT DID I RETURNED HE
533-131562-0009 I SHALL PUT YOU UP ON A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE FOR YOUR OWN PRIVATE EXPENSES AND YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ANY MORE ABOUT MY CONCERNS I SHALL LOOK OUT FOR A STEWARD MY DEAR I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO TEMPTATION
533-131562-0010 AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREEBS MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO UP ON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN
533-131562-0011 WHAT GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE YOU MADE MISTER HUNTINGDON
533-131562-0012 HAVE I TENDED TO DEFRAUD YOU
533-131562-0013 NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS BUT IT IS BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
533-131562-0014 HERE BENSON ENTERED THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED THE BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENTLY TRIUMPHING IN MY DESPAIR
533-131562-0015 I KNOW THAT DAY AFTER DAY SUCH FEELINGS WOULD RETURN UPON ME
533-131562-0016 I TRIED TO LOOK TO HIM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT IT WILL CLEAVE TO THE DUST
533-131564-0000 VAIN I FEAR
533-131564-0001 MISTER AND MISSUS HATTERSLEY HAVE BEEN STAYING AT THE GROVE A FORTNIGHT AND AS MISSUS HARGRAVE IS STILL ABSENT AND THE WEATHER WAS REMARKABLY FINE I NEVER PASSED THE DAY WITHOUT SEEING MY TWO FRIENDS MILICENT AND ESTHER EITHER THERE OR HERE
533-131564-0002 NO YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT HIM HOME
533-131564-0003 I CANT YOU DON'T WANT HIM DO YOU
533-131564-0004 IT IS A RESOLUTION YOU HAD FORMED LONG AGO
533-131564-0005 WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS THOUGH WE CAN'T RESPECT HIM
533-131564-0006 NO I'D RATHER BE LIKE MYSELF THEN AS I AM
533-131564-0007 NEVER MIND MY PLAIN SPEAKING SAID I IT WAS FROM THE BEST OF MOTIVES

533-131564-0016 HE FOLLOWED ME TO THE LIBRARY
533-131564-0017 I SOUGHT OUT AND PUT INTO HIS HAND TWO OF MILICENT'S LETTERS ONE DATED FROM LONDON AND WRITTEN DURING ONE OF HIS WILDEST SEASONS OF RECKLESS DISSIPATION THE OTHER IN THE COUNTRY DURING A LUCID INTERVAL
533-131564-0018 THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMSBY AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENUOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON THE OTHER MEN'S SHOULDERS
533-131564-0019 I'VE BEEN A CURSED RASCAL GOD KNOWS SAID HE AS HE GAVE IT A HEARTY SQUEEZE BUT YOU SEE IF I DON'T MAKE AMENDS FOR IT DAMN ME IF I DON'T
533-131564-0020 IF YOU INTEND TO REFORM INVOKE GOD'S BLESSING HIS MERCY AND HIS AID NOT HIS CURSE

533-131564-0024 MILLICENT FLEW TO THANK ME OVERWHELMING WITH GRATITUDE
533-131564-0025 CRIED SHE I COULDN'T HAVE INFLUENCED HIM I'M SURE BY ANYTHING I COULD HAVE SAID
533-131564-0026 YOU NEVER TRY ME MILLY SAID HE
533-131564-0027 AFTER THAT THEY WOULD REPAIR TO THEIR COUNTRY HOME
5442-32873-0000 CAPTAIN LAKE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE A LONDON DANDY NOW
5442-32873-0001 THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND A WILD LURE IN ITS YELLOW EYES RACHEL SAT DOWN
5442-32873-0002 A SLAVE ONLY A SLAVE
5442-32873-0003 O FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL IS IT A DREAM
5442-32873-0004 OH FRIGHTFUL DREADFUL
5442-32873-0005 STANLEY STANLEY IT WOULD BE MERCY TO KILL ME SHE BROKE OUT AGAIN
5442-32873-0006 BRIGHT AND GNATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH HIS BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF A SAGE HER PILLOW SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
5442-32873-0007 WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TOILET BOTTLE OF EAU COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
5442-32873-0008 THERE WAS NOTHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE PROGRESS
5442-32873-0009 THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES THEN SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM
5442-32873-0010 SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS
5442-32873-0011 RACHEL LEAK RACHEL LEAK WHAT ARE YOU NOW
5442-32873-0012 I'LL STAY HERE THAT IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND HER FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-32873-0013 HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGETT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0014 LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKIN'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WILDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOLL CART FOR MIKE BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOG CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
5442-32873-0015 BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LINE WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARDS THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGDON
5442-32873-0016 HERE WERE A FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELLED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
5442-32873-0017 LOSE NO TIME AND I LL GIVE YOU HALF A CRUMB
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STUCK HOME HIS GREASY WIDE AWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOLL CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAILED ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TAMAR
5442-41168-0000 THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCES OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COURSE SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR OTTO THE BALLOT
5442-41168-0004 WE SHED BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE IS NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 VOTES PLEASE ME
5442-41168-0007 THEY EXPRESS THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOVE FLEROV SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SERDYA IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENTS BAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GREY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED A SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JURED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0014 SERGEY IVANOVITCH FROWNED
5442-41168-0015 THAT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN DECISIONS HE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0017 ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETY EIGHT AGAINST
5442-41168-0018 SANG ON THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
5442-41168-0019 THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO KNOTS WERE FOUND ON THE BOX
5442-41168-0020 BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERRED
5442-41168-0021 IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHEWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO EVAN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SUFFER
5442-41168-0024 THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
5442-41168-0025 THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTIONS
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SMETKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT FLEROV TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMAN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRIES UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID ROUND HIM
5442-41169-0002 HE IS SUCH A BLACKGUARD
5442-41169-0003 I HAVE TOLD THEM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
5442-41169-0004 THE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY FIND CHAMPAGNE
5442-41169-0006 LAST YEAR OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S
5442-41169-0007 OH JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
5442-41169-0008 WHAT IS THERE TO UNDERSTAND
5442-41169-0009 THERE WAS NO MEANING IN IT AT ALL
5442-41169-0010 THEN TOO ONE MUST KEEP UP CONNEXIONS
5442-41169-0011 IT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF THE SORT
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE'S ONE'S OWN INTEREST
5442-41169-0013 THEY ARE PROPRIETORS OF A SOD BUT WE ARE LANDOWNERS
5442-41169-0014 IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THAT VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND HOW'S YOUR LAND DOING
5442-41169-0017 ONE'S WORK IS THROWN IN FOR NOTHING
5442-41169-0018 O WELL ONE DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0019 AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS IN THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASILEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THE LIME TREE
5442-41169-0023 HERE YOU'VE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BACH
5442-41169-0024 YOU'RE MARRIED I HEAR SAID THE LANDOWNER
5442-41169-0025 YES IT IS RATHER STRANGE HE WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THE LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MUSTACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR POLES FOR TIMBER
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO THE THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE IS A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE IS THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A RETURN TOO A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLES VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HERMANN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANER
5484-24317-0002 SHE WILL APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OFFICE
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THAT DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUNDS OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTIS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARISEN IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBORING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHEWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMANN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENOT
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AND INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELT CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICHO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENO'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSIMMACHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 A KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HARMON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES AND TIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISED ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMITYTAS THE LIEGE CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLIS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE BLACK PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSENAUT IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FOR THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WORRIED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMAN
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENAL HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD ENQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HERMAND LISTENED TO THE PRAYER IN SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENULT ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRATES HERMANN'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMEANOUR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMAND SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMANN'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WERE STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNAZE ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THE VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMANN PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS ROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BOX
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THAT BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN END AS A BOON FROM THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS CAN BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT THEM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMANN WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AN ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTIS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THE MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24318-0010 IT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH A TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILLIPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERRIMAN IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TOMORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPA SILENCED HER WITH THE GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HANDS POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT IN GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALAESTRA THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVED YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALWAYS
5484-24318-0021 DAPHNE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE WAS NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMANN WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TOMORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORK OF MYRTELUS
5484-24318-0024 WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL THEN AWAITS YOU
5484-24318-0025 AND I FOOL BLINDED ALSO IN MIND BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL AND PALLIATE NOTHING
5484-24318-0027 SORICIUS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF IN THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMINTES THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECTS OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROBBED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN DAPHNE'S MARRIAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE THE TRUTH ITS JUST DUE
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERMANN
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATULUS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HERMON
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BEEN FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOUR TO MYRTELUS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FEASTEL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMPS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THIS GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVESTS
5764-299665-0001 HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND MYSELF
5764-299665-0002 WHETHER ANY PRAYER WAS ANSWERED
5764-299665-0003 WHY DID HE CREATE THAT INTELLECTUAL INFERIOR
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC AND INSANE
5764-299665-0005 ARE THE FAILURES UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0006 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAD BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH THE LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOWED FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0008 IS HIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0009 DID THIS GOD ALONE THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0010 DID HE ALLOT TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0011 CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A FELLOW BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DIVORRE HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE FEEDS UPON LIFE
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NURSE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
5764-299665-0015 FEAR BUILDS AN ALTAR AND OFFERS THE SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0016 FEAR ERECTS A CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0017 LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FAITHFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0018 CAN WE SAY THAT HE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MAN
5764-299665-0019 CAN WE SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDURED FOREVER
5764-299665-0020 WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0021 WAS THEIR GOODNESS WAS THERE WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0022 OUGHT THE SUPERIOR RACE TOO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THE INFERIOR
5764-299665-0023 PEOPLE CLING TO THE SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0024 IF THEY GIVE ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE ANOTHER
5764-299665-0025 WHAT IS HIS POWER
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES TRUE EXPERIENCE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COMES TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0028 HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND KNOWS THAT IT IS A WRONG ROAD
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPED IT WITH HIS DIMPLED HANDS
5764-299665-0030 THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAS TAUGHT THE CHILD A LESSON
5764-299665-0031 IT'S A RESULT
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0033 WE LIVED TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS
5764-299665-0034 THEY WERE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
5764-299665-0035 THEY WERE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MORAL
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBES OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MEMBERS
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAS SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LOVE
5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THEIR REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0039 THE IMAGINATION IS CULTURED
5764-299665-0040 MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF ANOTHER
5764-299665-0041 THIS SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
5764-299665-0042 HE JUDGES HIMSELF
5764-299665-0043 IN ALL THIS THERE WAS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0044 MAN HAD DECEIVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HES CHRISTIANITY DUNGOOD
5764-299665-0046 WHEN THE CHURCH HAS CONTROL WERE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HATH RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY OR AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN WORSE WITHOUT RELIGION
5764-299665-0049 COULD IT HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0050 WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DO FOR HIM
5764-299665-0051 THEY HATED PLEASURES
5764-299665-0052 THEY MUFFLED THE BELLS OF GLADNESS
5764-299665-0053 THE RELIGION OF THE PURITANS WAS AN UNADULTERATED CURSE
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEVES THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE UPON HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN RECEIVED A BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT IS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT
5764-299665-0058 HAS THE BIBLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KINDLY AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES HAVE FAILED
5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
5764-299665-0061 RELIGION HAS NEVER MADE MAN FREE
5764-299665-0062 IT HAS NEVER MADE MEN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
5764-299665-0063 ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARER THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0064 CAN WE CURE DISEASE BY SUPPLICATIONS
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR HONOUR AS ALMS
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT HIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE GONE THE STONES
5764-299665-0068 THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A BASEMENT
5764-299665-0069 IF WE BUILT WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM
5764-299665-0070 I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER STONES
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNER STONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM END TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAD BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGNS BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0075 I SAID WHAT I THINK
5764-299665-0076 EVERY EVENT HAD PARENTS
5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HAD NOT HAPPENED COULD NOT
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHAINED RIIS AND THE CAMP BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
5764-299665-0079 WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PARENTS ARE NOT FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0080 WE KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE PATHS THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELLED
5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF EVENTS THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAD BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE THE REFORMERS FAIL
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND UPON THE LORD ON LUCK AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VICES TO THE CHILDREN
5764-299665-0087 FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PRODUCETH WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
5764-299665-0089 MUST THE WORLD FOR EVER REMAIN THE VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE A BURDEN AND CURSES
5764-299665-0091 PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEATH
5764-299665-0092 LAW CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEVER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
5764-299665-0093 THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY TALKING OR EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0094 THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THAT WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0095 THIS FREES WOMAN
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME WOULD BE CHILDLESS
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE VAULTS AND BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE
6070-63485-0000 THERE DONE FOR SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOW KEY TO THE CHOUETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE
6070-63485-0001 THE TWO MONSTERS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSE
6070-63485-0002 BY MEANS OF THIS STRATAGEM THEY FOLLOWED SO CLOSELY THAT ALTHOUGH WITHIN A FEW STEPS OF SARAH AND TOM THEY DID NOT SEE THEM
6070-63485-0003 SARAH AND HER BROTHER HAVING AGAIN PASSED BY THE TUPPY FRANC ARRIVED CLOSE TO THE DILAPIDATED HOUSE WHICH WAS PARTLY IN RUINS AND ITS OPENED CELLARS FORMED A KIND OF GULF ALONG WHICH THE STREET RAN IN THAT DIRECTION

6070-63485-0015 IN THE PLANE OF SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0016 BETWEEN SAINT OIN AND THE ROAD OF LA REVOLT AT THE END OF THE ROAD AGREED
6070-63485-0017 HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS OF A SELF STYLED FAN PAINTER
6070-63485-0018 THE FIANCAS STARTED
6070-86744-0000 FRANZ WHO SEEMED ATTRACTED BY SOME INVISIBLE INFLUENCE TOWARD THE COUNT IN WHICH TERROR WAS STRANGELY MINGLED FELT AN EXTREME RELUCTANCE TO PERMIT HIS FRIEND TO BE EXPOSED ALONE TO THE SINGULAR FASCINATION THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE SEEMED TO EXERCISE OVER HIM AND THEREFORE MADE NO OBJECTION TO ALBERT'S REQUEST BUT AT ONCE ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DESIRED SPOT AND AFTER A SHORT DELAY THE COUNT JOINED THEM IN THE SALON

6070-86744-0014 WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED ALBERT OF FRANCIS WHEN THEY HAD RETURNED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS YOU SEEM MORE THAN COMMONLY THOUGHTFUL
6070-86744-0015 I WILL CONFESS TO YOU ALBERT RETURNED FRANZ THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0016 DID YOU EVER MEET HIM PREVIOUSLY TO COMING HERE
6070-86744-0017 UPON MY HONOR THEN LISTEN TO ME
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY IN THE ALMOST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAM AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YACHT SEEN IN THE DISTANT HORIZON DRIVING UNDER FULL SAIL TOWARDS PORTO VECCHIO
6070-86744-0019 THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLISEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86744-0020 BUT SAID FRANTZ THE CORSICAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSEL
6070-86744-0021 WHY THE THING SEEMS TO ME SIMPLE ENOUGH
6070-86744-0022 TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DOES HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT WERE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINGTURED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY
6070-86744-0023 SURELY THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANSWERED
6070-86744-0024 MY DEAR FRANTZ REPLIED ALBERT WHEN ON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO DELIVER HIM
6070-86744-0025 WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT IS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHICH COUNTRY IS HE A NATIVE
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESS HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SIGNOR VAMPA WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASE AND UNCONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ALBERT'S SIDE
6070-86744-0028 WELL SAID FLORENCE WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT FOR YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND MY POWERS OF REFUTATION
6070-86744-0029 AND NOW MY DEAR FLORENCE LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
6070-86745-0000 THEN SHOULD ANY THING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND COURTS THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0002 AT A QUARTER TO TEN A VALET ENTERED HE COMPOSED OF A LITTLE GROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASSEUR ALSO
6070-86745-0003 WAIT THEN DURING THE DAY TELL ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISHES
6070-86745-0004 WELL AT HALF PAST TEN
6070-86745-0005 IS THE COUNCIL UP YET
6070-86745-0006 A VALET LEFT THE ROOM
6070-86745-0007 GOOD MORNING LOCIEN GOOD MORNING SAID ALBERT YOUR PUNCTUALITY REALLY ALARMS ME
6070-86745-0008 YOU WHOM I EXPECTED YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIXED WAS HALF PAST
6070-86745-0009 NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW DO NOT CONFIRM OUR PLANS
6070-86745-0010 HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGES IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTH
6070-86745-0011 IT IS FOR THAT REASON YE SEE ME SO EARLY
6070-86745-0012 I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO HAVE THE RIDE FOR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 PESTES I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT YOU WOULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE
6070-86745-0014 BESIDES IT DOES NOT CONCERN THE HOME BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
6070-86745-0015 WHAT ABOUT THE PAPERS
6070-86745-0016 AND THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAY IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE
6070-86745-0018 COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIA
6070-86745-0019 WITH YOUR TALENTS YOU WILL MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
6128-63240-0001 THAT IS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
6128-63240-0002 SHE WAS WILLING TO RISK THAT
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR ENQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORKADAY ASPECT
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PEN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF A CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS THE EYES WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTONFIELD
6128-63240-0009 HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPERS AND ROARING RADICALS
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT O MURDER
6128-63240-0012 HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUNAR WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6128-63240-0013 SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT EXACTLY THE LATTER
6128-63240-0014 HAD YOU BEEN IN EUROPE
6128-63240-0015 NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYHOW
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES IT SHE WILL LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISS LENA
6128-63240-0018 ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YE LOOK AS IF YOU WERE
6128-63240-0019 AND MISS LENA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0020 ONE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR
6128-63240-0021 BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BASTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0022 THAT IS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOME A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED THE SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNEY'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISSUS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A THEATER PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LONEY'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSLOW THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO AEOTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LONU'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002 RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THE REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THIS WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANYONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEATS
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM A STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BAZIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED IT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0009 OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERY THING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFED AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0012 HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BASER RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF HAD THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE LADIES OF BEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT THE BALLOT
6128-63244-0002 PERHAPS SHE CAN SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
6128-63244-0004 OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WAS SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0005 ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FAVENDER WHO LIVED AT ROXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINGERS SUPPOSED BUT THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0007 SHE WISHED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF A PEOPLE
6128-63244-0008 THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST EXCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0009 CHARLIE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WHITE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH THE MOST
6128-63244-0010 OLIVE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MISSUS SPARRINGER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
6128-63244-0011 IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING
6128-63244-0012 OUR MOMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
6128-63244-0013 RAISE THE STANDARD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME A THOUSAND NAMES
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CURRANTS MISSUS FARRENDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0015 SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR REMISSION OF RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0016 I WANTED TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THE SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
6128-63244-0018 THE UNHAPPINESS OF WOMAN
6128-63244-0019 THEY WERE HIS SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THEIR DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT THE JUST REVOLUTION IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTAL BLOODSTAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0021 THEY WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMEN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE MIST OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY AS SUCCESS
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BIRDS EYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEM ALREADY A MARTYR
6128-63244-0024 OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG AND WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OR AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER TO AS MANY CREASES AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
6432-63722-0000 BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YOU FIGURE ON DOIN SOME DETECTIN AND GIVING UP FISHING
6432-63722-0001 AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFAIR HAD TAKEN
6432-63722-0002 I AM GOING OFF FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING AND MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
6432-63722-0003 GET READY SHAG YASA COLONEL
6432-63722-0004 AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HAD HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
6432-63722-0005 PINKUS AND DONOVAN HAVEN'T THEY CAROL YOU UP
6432-63722-0006 CARROLL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
6432-63722-0007 ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON THE CASE COLONEL
6432-63722-0008 BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT COLONEL THAN THE CAT
6432-63722-0009 PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED COLONEL ASHLY
6432-63722-0010 WE'VE GOT OUR MAN AND THAT'S ALL WE WANT
6432-63722-0011 YOU ARE ON THE DARCY CASE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YES
6432-63722-0012 I'M WORKING IN THE INTERESTS OF THE YOUNG MAN
6432-63722-0013 IT'S JEST ONE OF THEM COINCIDENCES LIKE
6432-63722-0014 BUSTED HIS HEAD WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE OF A PAIR
6432-63722-0015 GAD EXCLAIMED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0016 THAT VERY PAIR I WAS GOING TO BUY
6432-63722-0017 LOOK HERE COLONEL DO YOU KNOW ANY THING ABOUT THIS
6432-63722-0018 THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOWS OF SINGA PHUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63722-0020 NOW I AM AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
6432-63722-0021 PHUTE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED SHER ALI
6432-63722-0022 ANYHOW HE AND BUD DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL IT SEEMS
6432-63722-0023 NEIGHBOURS OFTEN HEARD HIM SCRAPPING A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
6432-63722-0024 TOWARDS DARK A MAN WENT IN TO BUY A LAMP
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND THE HEAVY CANDLESTICK NEAR IT
6432-63722-0026 SHORE HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
6432-63722-0027 MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOES TALKED IN THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBOURS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0028 AND THE WATCH HAVE IT YES IT'S HERE
6432-63722-0029 THAT'S THE WATCH ANNOUNCED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE REACHING IN FOR IT GOING YET
6432-63722-0030 YOU'RE NOT AS SQUEAMISH AS ALL THAT ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DEAD MAN'S HANDS AND WOMAN'S
6432-63722-0031 AND DONAL'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SCEPTICAL
6432-63722-0032 IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUGH EDGES ON IT
6432-63722-0033 I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
6432-63722-0034 IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE A BIT
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THAT BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AND HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIME PIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL
6432-63722-0038 AND DONAMAN TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
6432-63722-0039 ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE
6432-63722-0040 DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELVES ON IT WHATEVER YOU DO WHY NOT
6432-63722-0041 SIMPLY BECAUSE THE WATCH

6432-63722-0045 I WANT TO TALK OVER DARCY'S CASE WITH YOU THE COLONEL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED AND THOUGHT HAD TALKED AGAIN AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
6432-63722-0046 WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE LOOK AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0047 RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTEEN FIFTY PROPOSITION
6432-63722-0048 AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH THE SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0049 AND I DON'T WANT IT EITHER
6432-63722-0050 I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW
6432-63722-0051 BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE THINKING OUT FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK
6432-63722-0052 IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I'LL PRETEND I'M FISHING AND I CAN CATCH SOMETHING
6432-63722-0053 IN FACT I HAVE A FEELING THAT I WILL LAND MY FISH

6432-63722-0057 IT STILL HOLDS GOOD
6432-63722-0058 NO ALIMONY REPLIED THE COLONEL PUZZLED JUST THAT
6432-63722-0059 THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW
6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILLFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
6432-63723-0001 AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FLESH INTO THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
6432-63723-0002 THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY ENQUIRED KENNETH
6432-63723-0003 NO I WASN'T THINKING OF IT
6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR TODAY
6432-63723-0005 WELL I DON'T KNOW YOU CAN
6432-63723-0006 IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAD LEFT HIM
6432-63723-0007 IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF THE BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0009 THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
6432-63723-0010 AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS ONLY UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED
6432-63723-0011 HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012 SHE SAID HE STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0013 BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO DEFENSE
6432-63723-0014 LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE A SEPARATION
6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL FEE
6432-63723-0016 NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGEMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0017 IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP
6432-63723-0018 STILL I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0020 IT HAS A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALLROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
6432-63723-0022 LORCH HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
6432-63723-0023 IN A SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOONKEEPER
6432-63723-0024 AND WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RACHFORD HAD MARRIED
6432-63723-0025 TO THAT WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED MONEY
6432-63723-0026 IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE
6432-63723-0027 SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING ALL DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
6432-63723-0028 AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT CAN HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
6432-63723-0029 THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARGE THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
6432-63723-0030 IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
6432-63723-0031 IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THE STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL
6432-63723-0032 MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADING THAT SOMETHING TO BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
6432-63723-0033 DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0034 I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME
6432-63723-0035 IT'S HARD FOR MISSUS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP LIKE A MAJOR
6432-63723-0036 SO KING GOT BAIL PUT IT UP
6432-63723-0037 IT WAS HIGHE LARCH
6432-63723-0038 THEY TOOK HARRY AWAY AWHILE AGO
6432-63723-0039 BUT THIS ARE PRETTY UNCERTAIN SHOES TO BE IN JUST THE SAME
6432-63723-0040 ONLY THAT I DARCY HESITATED AND GROW RED
6432-63723-0041 GOOD EVENING COLONEL HE CALLED GENIALLY WILL YOU JOIN ME IN THE WELSH RABBIT
6432-63723-0042 THANK YOU
6432-63723-0043 I AM AFRAID MY DIGESTION ISN'T QUITE UP TO THAT AS I'VE HAD TO CUT OUT MY FISHING OF LATE
6432-63723-0044 NOW AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THIS STORE ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER
6432-63723-0045 THE STOPPED COCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU ANY THEORY
6432-63723-0046 THERE WERE THREE OF THEM THE CENTER FIGURE BEING THAT OF HARRY KING AND HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOXICATED
6432-63723-0047 THAT IS NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES IT HAPPEN TO BE SO NOW
6432-63723-0048 I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTIVATED TONES HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO USE YET OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE USE OF LATE
6432-63723-0049 I SAID WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED THE OTHER WE HAVE MISSED YOU
6432-63723-0050 I SAY I WAS GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY THOUGH WITH AN EFFORT
6432-63723-0051 WHY POLONIUS SOMEONE ASKED
6432-63723-0052 BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
6432-63723-0053 THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON A MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
6432-63723-0054 IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELLERY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
6432-63723-0055 I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
6432-63723-0056 THAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELLER
6432-63723-0057 NOW HENRY KING HAS IT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY
6938-70848-0000 THE SUN CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY AT NOON
6938-70848-0001 THE COLD AND RHEUMATISM OF THE RAINY MONTHS VANISHED
6938-70848-0002 ASKED A WORKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YOUNKERS
6938-70848-0003 WAL DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US ONE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARM IN A SLING
6938-70848-0004 HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER EM BY THE DEVILS
6938-70848-0005 WHO ARE YOU TO DESTROY THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS OLENIN A GERMAN
6938-70848-0006 WHO ARE YOU A COUNTER REVOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THE BELOVED ADAM
6938-70848-0007 YOU CALL YOURSELVES A PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU ARE NOT THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA
6938-70848-0008 THE PISANTS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS
6938-70848-0009 WE KNOW WHAT THE PEASANTS WOULD SAY AREN'T THEY WORKING MEN LIKE OURSELVES
6938-70848-0010 THIS MAN SPECIALLY WELCOMED THE CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PEASANTS
6938-70848-0011 THESE LAST WERE THE YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
6938-70848-0012 WHEREUPON THE OLD EXECUTED COMMITTEE LEFT THE HALL
6938-70848-0013 DOWN WITH HIM HE SHRIEKED
6938-70848-0014 FEARFUL TUMULT CRIED DOWN WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI
6938-70848-0015 UPON MY RETURN I VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANYONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
6938-70848-0016 MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STATUS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
6938-70848-0017 BY DECLINING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO PLOT THE RE ELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LAST SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONIST DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRIAN PROGRAM OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
6938-70848-0020 THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO BREAK THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
6938-70848-0021 FOLLOWING HIM OLENIN LISTENED TO NOW WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
6938-70848-0022 THE FIRST AGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALIST AND THE LANDOWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CLOSELY RELATED
6938-70848-0023 THE DUMESS AND ZAM STOOLS WERE DROPPED
6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED
6938-70848-0025 HE SPOKE TO THE GRIM CONVENTION
6938-70848-0026 THE VILLAGE WILL SAVE US IN THE END
6938-70848-0027 BUT THE PRESENT MOVEMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IT IS INVINCIBLE
6938-70848-0028 THE WHEEL OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN THE HALL
6938-70848-0029 A NEW HUMANITY WOULD BE BORN OF THIS WAR
6938-70848-0030 I GREET YOU WITH THE CHRISTENING OF NEW RUSSIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM
7018-75788-0000 THEN I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRASHED IN HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
7018-75788-0001 BEHOLD THE SHIP WAS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THE DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
7018-75788-0002 SEEING THIS I WAS SORE TROUBLED REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED FROM THE APE KIND
7018-75788-0003 UPON THIS HE BROUGHT ME A COTTON BAG AND GIVING IT TO ME SAID TAKE THIS BAG AND FILL IT WITH PEBBLES FROM THE BEACH AND GO FORTH WITH THE COMPANY OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO WHOM I WILL GIVE A CHARGE RESPECTING THEE
7018-75788-0004 DO AS THEY DO AND BE LIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FURTHER THY RETURN VOYAGE TO THY NATIVE LAND
7018-75788-0005 THEN HE CARRIED ME TO THE BEACH WHERE I FILLED MY BAGS WITH PEBBLES LARGE AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLK ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH BEARING A BAG LIKE MINE FILLED WITH PEBBLES
7018-75788-0006 TO THESE HE COMMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO THEIR CARE SAYING THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY GET HIS DAILY BREAD AND YOU WILL EARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
7018-75788-0007 NOW SLEEPING UNDER THESE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES WHEREUPON MY COMPANIONS BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE FOLK
7018-75788-0008 WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF THE DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
7018-75788-0009 IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINTH NIGHT
7018-75788-0010 AND CEASED NOT SAILING UNTIL WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT BUSSORAH
7018-75788-0011 THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTER AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FOREGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STOREHOUSES
7018-75788-0012 AFTER THAT I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GREAT PROFIT AND GAIN I HAD MADE
7018-75788-0013 NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING MOHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL CREATURES BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINBAD THE SEAMAN AND WISHED HIM A GOOD DAY
7018-75788-0014 THERE I FOUND A GREAT SHIP READY FOR SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD WITH THEM GOODS OF PRICE SO I EMBARKED MY BALES THEREIN
7018-75788-0015 HAPPY AMONGST YOU IS ONE RIGHTEOUS WHOSE PRAYERS THE LORD WILL ACCEPT
7018-75788-0016 PRESENTLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE MOUNTAIN AND BROKE UP AND ALL ON BOARD OF HER WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75788-0017 BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS COLOR AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE TRAVELLERS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
7018-75788-0018 EACH THAT DIED WE WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTHES AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE TILL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT LITTLE PROVISION LEFT I WHO WAS WONT TO HAVE SO MUCH
7018-75788-0019 THERE IS MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT
7018-75789-0000 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIRST NIGHT
7018-75789-0001 THEN SIGNED FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND CORMORINE ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIP'S STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD MAKING ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
7018-75789-0002 LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE ON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS A KNIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
7018-75789-0003 I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED ME THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN ON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT IN MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0005 WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND A RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
7018-75789-0006 I WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE RIVER
7018-75789-0007 WHEN THEY SAW I UNDERSTOOD THEM AND MADE THEM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER
7018-75789-0008 OH MY BROTHER ANSWERED HE WE ARE HUSBANDMEN AND TILLERS OF THE SOIL WHO CAME OUT TO WATER OUR FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS AND FINDING THEE ASLEEP ON THIS RAFT LAID HOLD OF IT AND MADE IT FAST BY US AGAINST THOU SHOULDEST AWAKE AT THY LEISURE
7018-75789-0009 I ANSWERED FOR ALLAH'S SAKE O MY LORD ERE I SPEAK GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT FOR I AM STARVING AND AFTER ASK ME WHAT THOU WILT
7018-75789-0010 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY SECOND NIGHT
7018-75789-0011 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HAD TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING THAT HE MAY ACQUAINT HIM WITH HIS ADVENTURES
7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEFS OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0013 SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MY OWN LAND
7018-75789-0014 QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US IN OUR HEAD AND EYES BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST US WITH THY COMPANY

7018-75789-0016 I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND OF ALL MY INTIMATES AND ACQUAINTANCES IN THE ISLAND AND EMBARKED WITH THE MERCHANTS AFORESAID
7018-75789-0017 HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THIS CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER
7018-75789-0018 FOR STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM ON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND UPON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUESTS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
7018-75789-0019 HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THIS AND AS FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST I WITNESSED
7018-75789-0020 PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRYMAKING AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED
7018-75789-0021 SUCH THEN O MY BROTHERS IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL ME IN MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TOMORROW INSHALLAH
7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAYS IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMEN
7018-75789-0026 KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE AND ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH IN MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGHDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLIMBED TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IT IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING YOU WHOSO COME HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS THE SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NOUGHT MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND ROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO WATTERBATH'S GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPAIRING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF ACQUITTAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT BE COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BYE ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DONING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTERS
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATHLIKE HUSH
7105-2330-0007 THE FOREMAN DELIVERED THIS MESSAGE
7105-2330-0008 THE JURY FIND A PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISHED TO ADD A WRITER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A VI ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS ON HAND
7105-2330-0010 AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE POLL A JUNIOR CONSUL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
7105-2330-0011 FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT IS TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF
7105-2330-0012 OUR MAJORITY WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN
7105-2330-0013 SEVENTEEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTER BUFF IS OUT BEFORE THE POLE OPENS
7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RED RUPPERS INN TO NIGHT
7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRILO OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
7105-2330-0017 HE EXCLAIMED DON'T GO
7105-2330-0018 HE SAYS HE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM OUT AND HE IS NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW
7105-2330-0019 SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A RELIGIOUS PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ESTIMATES
7105-2330-0020 AND ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BAND
7105-2330-0021 HALL OPENS IN FIVE MINUTES
7105-2330-0022 IS FLATTER BUFF OUT YET
7105-2330-0023 IN HEAVEN'S NAME
7105-2330-0024 THE CHIEF ORGANISER RANG OFF
7105-2330-0025 THAT IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
7105-2330-0026 CAN'T YOU GET THE STRIKE PERMIT ASKED THE ORGANIZER
7105-2330-0027 I LL TRY SAID THE HOME SECRETARY AND WENT TO THE TELEPHONE
7105-2330-0028 EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WE VOTE THE OTHER WAY
7105-2330-0029 THE TELEGRAM WAS BROUGHT IN
7105-2330-0030 IT WAS FROM THE CENTRAL COMETY ROOMS AT NEMESIS
7105-2330-0031 WITHOUT THE BAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND
7105-2330-0032 QUARTER PAST TEN HALF PAST
7105-2330-0033 HAVE YOU ANY BAD INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY NATURE TO PLAY
7105-2330-0034 DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANISER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS THOSE SORT OF THINGS
7105-2330-0035 THE WARDERS HAVE A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THEM MEN THEMSELVES
7105-2330-0036 LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISER
7105-2330-0037 A POPULAR SONG OF THE MOMENT REPLIED THE AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT TO THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONER STRODE FORTH TO FREEDOM
7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF THE SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HULL
7105-2330-0040 THIS SEAT WAS LOST AFTER ALL BY A NARROW MATURITY
7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENCE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTER BATH FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
7105-2340-0000 WITH THAT NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIS HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF A PERSON ONE WANTED IN ONE'S HOUSE
7105-2340-0001 WELL THE FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID THE HUSBAND OR ER DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE ESTATE
7105-2340-0002 BESIDES CYNICISM APART HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIS FAILINGS
7105-2340-0003 WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY NOT MERELY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVES NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THE THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY
7105-2340-0004 WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRED PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTEREFFECTS OF A POLO ACCIDENT
7105-2340-0005 A WILFRED FINCOTE HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONOURS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRED HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK
7105-2340-0006 AND THEIR REPUTATION WAS AN UNPLEASANT ONE
7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOL DAYS ONWARDS HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF CLEPTOMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION
7105-2340-0008 THE SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEON COLE TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THEIR CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRED SAYING HE IS PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS
7105-2340-0009 SIGNED WILFRED PIGEONCOT
7105-2340-0010 I SUPPOSE HE'S BRINGING US A PRESENT FOR THE SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS
7105-2340-0011 THE TALKING FLITTED NERVOUSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER
7105-2340-0012 IN THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER THE NERVOUSNESS AND AWKWARDNESS INCREASED
7105-2340-0013 OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETER SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUEST HERE THEY ALL ARE
7105-2340-0014 SUCH NICE USEFUL GIFTS A FEW DUPLICATES OF COURSE
7105-2340-0015 SEVERAL CREAM JUGS PUT IN PETER
7105-2340-0016 WE FELT THAT WE MUST LIVE ON CREAM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
7105-2340-0017 OF COURSE SOME OF THEM CAN'T BE CHANGED
7105-2340-0018 I PUT IT DOWN BY THAT CLARET JUG SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER OBJECT
7105-2340-0019 VIGILANCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY CROWNED WITH A SENSE OF VICTORY
7105-2340-0020 AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THE VISITOR MISSUS PETER EXPRESSED HER CONVICTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN SOMETHING
7105-2340-0021 HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THAT MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I'M HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY ONE OFF
7105-2340-0022 IT IS THE ONLY THING TO DO
7105-2340-0023 WILFRID WAS LATE IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNERS SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS
7105-2340-0024 IT IS AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU
7105-2340-0025 IT WAS A LITTLE PRESENT FOR MY MOTHER AND MYSELF FOR YOUR SILVER WEDDING
7105-2340-0026 I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND YOU SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT RATHER AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING YOU ANOTHER
7105-2340-0027 THIS SNATCHER HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THESE MANY YEARS
7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNESTINE PAGE ANDCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPACT OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
7105-2340-0029 HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED BLANKLY AND DESOLATELY AT ONE ANOTHER
7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANY THING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE ARE AT BREAKFAST
7105-2340-0031 SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS
7105-2340-0032 THE PIGEONS HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION
7105-2340-0033 PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT THE GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
7105-2340-0034 MISSUS PETER TURNED TO HER GUESTS WITH CONFIDENTIAL COYNESS
7105-2340-0035 PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS A TRANSCEND A FAMILY GOOD LORD
7105-2340-0036 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A KLEPTOMANIA LIKE COUSIN SNATCHER
7105-2340-0037 BRAVE LITTLE WOMAN SAID PETER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I CAN NEVER HAVE DONE IT
7902-96591-0000 I AM FROM THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST
7902-96591-0001 DON'T CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO GO
7902-96591-0002 AND YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
7902-96591-0003 I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE
7902-96591-0004 MY FATHER SIR RISDON GRAHAM HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE
7902-96591-0005 HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YOU SHOULD NOT TELL
7902-96591-0006 PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHY WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD A FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RAYSTROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 IT ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME IN THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I'LL SOON SHOW THEM I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME OUT
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS THE FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS THE BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO A STONE SILL
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0018 IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0019 NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE CANNOT DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOREVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALLS IN TWO PLACES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHEN A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THE HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO IS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
7902-96592-0000 SURE YOU'VE LOOKED AROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES FATHER QUITE
7902-96592-0001 I AM GOING HOME TO BREAKFAST
7902-96592-0002 SHALL I COME TOO FATHER
7902-96592-0003 STOP HERE TILL SIR RISDON COMES DOWN AND TELL HIM I AM VERY SORRY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED OUT LAST NIGHT ONLY A BORN FOOL SAW JERRY ANDY'S LOBSTER BOAT COMING INTO THE COVE AND CAME RUNNING TO SAY IT WAS A PARTY FROM THE CUTTER YES FATHER
7902-96592-0004 TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR AWAY TONIGHT
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHIE RESTROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 A QUEER DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TELLE THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 WHY DID ANDY CALL MISTER GURR FATHER
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH A LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0010 I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE
7902-96592-0011 NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT UPON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TONIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RUN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 RREN WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE
7902-96592-0016 HELLO HE SAID WHO ARE YOU

7902-96592-0025 ARCHY STEPPED BACK TO THE DOOR LISTENING BUT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND
7902-96592-0026 HE IS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT A CHIMNEY PRESENTED ITSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALISED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASSAILING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRT INTO ITS SHEATH
7902-96592-0032 NO I CAN'T PART WITH THAT HA HA LAUGHED THE BOY JEERINGLY
7902-96592-0033 BUT I'LL YES I'LL GIVE YOU A GUINEA IF YOU'LL LET ME OUT

7975-280057-0002 MY MOTHER WHO WAS BESHEBA FRISTAUX OF INDEPENDENCE WAS A DAUGHTER OF RICHARD FRISTAUX WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON AT NEW ORLEANS JACKSON COUNTY HAVING BEEN SO NAMED AT MY GRANDFATHER FRISTEAUX'S INSISTENCE
7975-280057-0003 I CAN NOT REMEMBER WHEN I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SHOOT

7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS A DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISONVILLE SHE WENT TO WAVERLY WHERE SHE WAS HOUNDED CONTINUALLY

7975-280063-0010 I WAS TOLD BY SOME OF OUR MEN FROM THE WESTERN BORDER OF THE STATE THAT THEY RECOGNISED THE DARING YOUNG RIDER AS COAL YOUNGER
7975-280063-0011 ABOUT NINE A M I WAS SHOT DOWN
7975-280063-0012 THE WOUNDED OF BOTH FORCES WERE GATHERED UP AND PLACED IN HOUSES
7975-280076-0000 ALTHOUGH EVERY BOOK PURPORTING TO NARRATE THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AS TOLD OF THE LIBERTY ROBBERY AND IMPLIED THAT WE HAD A PART IN IT THE YOUNGERS WERE NOT SUSPECTED AT THAT TIME NOR FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPARDS RED MOCKERS AND BUD PENCE WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUANTRELLES
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAID WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BLOODSHED JUDGE MC CLEAN THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FATALLY
7975-280076-0003 NO WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGEST BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
7975-280076-0004 JUNE THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE OBICCOCK BROTHERS BANK AT CROYD AND IOWA WAS ROBBED OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BY SEVEN MEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
7975-280076-0005 IT WAS CHARGED THAT ARTHUR MAC COY OR A C MC COY AND MYSELF HAD BEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE GADS HILL AFFAIR AND THE TWO STAGE ROBBERIES
7975-280076-0006 THE PARTS OF THE LETTER NOW RELEVANT ARE AS FOLLOWS
7975-280076-0007 YOU MAY USE THE LETTER IN YOUR OWN WAY
7975-280076-0008 I WILL GIVE YOU THE OUTLINE AND SKETCH OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND ACTIONS AT THE TIME OF CERTAIN ROBBERIES WITH WHICH I AM CHARGED
7975-280076-0009 AT THE TIME OF THE GALLETON BANK ROBBERING I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM POLICE TAILOR AND RECTOR
7975-280076-0010 THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SHERIFF BARKELEY AND FIFTY OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
7975-280076-0011 I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS SAID FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY
7975-280076-0012 I WENT TO ARKANSAS AND RETURNED TO SAINT CLAIR COUNTY ABOUT THE FIRST OF MAY
7975-280076-0013 I WENT TO KANSAS WHERE OUR CATTLE WERE IN WOODSSON COUNTY AT COLONEL RIDGE'S
7975-280076-0014 DURING SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS BUT AS THERE WAS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED THAT SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE I WAS
7975-280076-0015 I WENT THROUGH INDEPENDENCE AND FROM THERE TO A S WEBBS
7975-280076-0016 THERE I TOOK DINNER AND THEN WENT TO DOCTOR L W TRYMAN'S
7975-280076-0017 OUR BUSINESS THERE WAS TO SEE E P WEST HE WAS NOT AT HOME BUT THE FAMILY WILL REMEMBER WE WERE THERE
7975-280076-0018 WE CROSSED ON THE BRIDGE STAYED IN THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND NEXT MORNING WE RODE UP THROUGH THE CITY
7975-280076-0019 I MET SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AMONG THEM WAS BOB HUDSPATH
7975-280076-0020 WE WERE NOT ON GOOD TERMS AT THAT TIME NOR HAVE WE BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS
7975-280076-0021 POOR JOHN HE HAD BEEN HUNTED DOWN AND SHOT LIKE A WILD BEAST AND NEVER WAS A BOY MORE INNOCENT
7975-280076-0022 DOCTOR L LEWES WAS HIS PHYSICIAN
7975-280076-0023 THERE ARE FIFTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS THERE WHO WILL TESTIFY IN ANY COURT THAT JOHN AND I WERE THERE
7975-280076-0024 HELVIN FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WERE ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND EITHER OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE ABOVE FOR JOHN AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MISTER SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND WAS IN HIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MISTER AND MISSUS FICKLE AFTER THE SERVICE
7975-280076-0025 ABOUT THE LAST OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE I ARRIVED IN CARROLL PARRISH LOUISIANA
7975-280076-0026 I STAYED THERE TILL THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
7975-280076-0027 I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THAT TIME I WAS AT NEOTIO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAY
7975-280076-0028 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY AT ADER IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY
7975-280084-0000 I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED WE SHOULD NOT SHOOT ANYONE
7975-280084-0001 WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOODS BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT INTO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
7975-280084-0002 WHEN WE CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
7975-280084-0003 J S ALLEN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN ROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
7975-280084-0004 GET YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY ARE ROBBING THE BANK
7975-280084-0005 I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS AT THE BRIDGE THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
7975-280084-0006 ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT IN THE BACK
7975-280084-0007 CHADWELL WOOD AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
7975-280084-0008 IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN WOOD
7975-280084-0009 MEANWHILE THE STREET WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY HOT
7975-280084-0010 EVERY TIME I SAW ANYONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7975-280084-0011 DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UPSTAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
7975-280084-0012 CHANGING HIS PISTOL INTO HIS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILLER'S MARE
7975-280084-0013 WHAT KEPT YE SO LONG I ASKED PITTS
7975-280084-0014 AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THE BANK I TAKE THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTH FIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0015 WHERE IS THE MONEY OUTSIDE THE SAFE BOB ASKED
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL FITZ FACED HIM WITH A BULLET
7975-280084-0017 THE FIRST ONE MISSED HIM AND THE SECOND WENT THROUGH HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
7975-280085-0000 THAT NIGHT IT STARTED TO RAIN AND WE WORE OUR HORSES
7975-280085-0001 FRIDAY WE MOVED TOWARD WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMPED BETWEEN ELYSIAN AND GERMAN LAKE
7975-280085-0002 BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARMHOUSE CLOSE TO MANCATO
7975-280085-0003 THAT DAY A MAN NAMED DURNING DISCOVERED US AND WE TOOK HIM PRISONER
7975-280085-0004 FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS TILL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE AGREED NOT TO
7975-280085-0005 NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POST HASTE INTO MANCADO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
7975-280085-0006 THE WHISTLE ON THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS THE SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
7975-280085-0007 HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH IT PILLAR ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
7975-280085-0008 BUT THEY SOON GOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM BROKE MY WALKING STICK WITH A SHOT
7975-280085-0009 WE WERE IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG SAW HORSES WHEN THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE ANIMALS AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
7975-280085-0010 SIX STEPS TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T O WALT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J C
7975-280085-0011 FORMING A LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE OF THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ROBBERS WERE DISCOVERED
7975-280085-0012 MAKE FOR THE HORSES I SAY EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
7975-280085-0013 THERE IS NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHARGE THEM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN
7975-280085-0014 I GOT UP AS A SIGNAL FOR THE CHARGE AND WE FIRED ONE VOLLEY
7975-280085-0015 ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELED ON BOB IN SPITE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS A FLAG OF TRUCE
7975-280085-0016 SHERIFF GLISPIN OF WATWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
7975-280085-0017 INCLUDING THOSE RECEIVED IN AND ON THE WAY FROM NORTH FIELD I HAD ELEVEN WOUNDS
7975-280085-0018 IN SHERIFF GLISPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTECTORATE THAT MINNESOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
8131-117016-0000 CAPTAIN MURDOCH
8131-117016-0001 BUT MARSPORT HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO KILL IT
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MAN
8131-117016-0003 THE STONE WALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DARELX AND FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORIES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF A MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS HERE NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOP KEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0007 CAPTAIN MURDOCK WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND WAS ASKING FOR MORE MEN
8131-117016-0008 THAT PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET THEM FOR HIM
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE BODY FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE RELIEF
8131-117016-0010 I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE ARE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY WE WOULD ON EARTH
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERYONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT
8131-117016-0012 THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE ARE GOING TO USE ON THE STONE WALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
8131-117016-0013 HE PICKED OUT FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU WILL COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TO NIGHT PICK ANY ROUTE THAT'S OPEN O K MEN LET'S GO
8131-117016-0015 BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCK'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTHCOP
8131-117016-0016 TWO YEARS GORDON
8131-117016-0017 A SECOND GORDON CURSED HIMSELF
8131-117016-0018 HE BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT SECURITY
8131-117016-0019 NOBODY TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHOB BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGIN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE A CITIZEN WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THE FINELY TURNED CLUB IN HIS HAND
8131-117016-0024 GORDON'S EYES POPPED AT THIS
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWED THAT SENTIMENT HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVING NOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER FOUR COPSE HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
8131-117016-0027 HE BROUGHT THEM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEYS
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPSE STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0029 TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL A WAGON
8131-117016-0030 WE'RE NOT USING WAGONS MURDOCK TOLD EM LINE THEM UP
8131-117016-0031 IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED TERRIBLY
8131-117016-0032 MURDOCK INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDER SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS THICK AS GORDON'S FELT
8131-117016-0034 I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THAT GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD THE MAN
8131-117016-0035 THEY'D KILL ME I DON'T KNOW
8131-117016-0036 MURDOCK TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE AND TURNED TO THE WRETCHED TUFTS
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL FIND YOU
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER
8131-117016-0039 MURDOCK SENT ONE OF THE MEN TO PICK UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX THEN A THIRD
8131-117016-0040 AND THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN WHO'D BEEN BEATEN BEFORE
8131-117016-0041 GET A STRETCHER AND TAKE HIM WHERE HE BELONGS HE ORDERED
8131-117016-0042 THE CAPTAIN STIRRED FINALLY SIGHING
8131-117016-0043 NO THE COPSE THEY ARE GIVING ME WE'RE COVERED GORDON
8131-117016-0044 BUT THE STONEWALL GANG IS BACKING WANE
8131-117016-0045 IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH ON THEM
8131-117016-0046 BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I HAVE GOT A YELLOW TICKET FROM SECURITY
8131-117016-0047 MURDOCK BLINKED AND DROPPED HIS EYES SLOWLY
8131-117016-0048 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAIN WILL BE REELECTED
8131-117016-0049 NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPT THE GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER
8131-117016-0050 NEVER SEE A MARTIAN ELECTION
8131-117016-0051 NO YOU'RE A FURSTER HE CAN'T LOSE
8131-117016-0052 AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THE WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WHAT THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT ROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0055 COST HIM MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE IZZIE IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE SEES IT
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT OTHER IDEAS OF THE STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
8131-117016-0058 THE CREWS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCK WAS TRAINING A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
8131-117016-0059 IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING WAS THERE
8131-117016-0060 THIS WOULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D SEEN ON EARTH
8131-117016-0061 BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAIN WAS REELECTED
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHO BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORISED PRECINCT HOUSE
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANYONE HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117017-0002 AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HAYLEY'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117017-0003 GORDON HIT THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MARSE SPEAKER LET OUT A SHRILL WHISTLE
8131-117017-0004 GUNS SUDDENLY SEEM TO BE FLOURISHING EVERYWHERE
8131-117017-0005 YOU CAN'T DO IT ME
8131-117017-0006 I'M REFORMED I AM GOING STRAIGHT
8131-117017-0007 YOU DAMNED COPSE CAN'T ONA WAS BLUBBERING
8131-117017-0008 ONE LOOK WAS ENOUGH THE WORK PAPERS HAD THE TELLTALE OVER THICKENING OF THE SIGNATURE THAT HAD SHOWED UP ON OTHER PAPERS OBVIOUSLY FORGERIES
8131-117017-0009 SOME TURNED AWAY AS GORDON AND THE OTHER COP WENT TO WORK BUT MOST OF THEM WEREN'T SQUEAMISH
8131-117017-0010 WHEN IT WAS OVER THE TWO PICKED UP THEIR WHIMPERING CAPTIVES
8131-117017-0011 JENKINS THE OTHER COP HAD BEEN HOLDING THE WALLET
8131-117017-0012 MUST HAVE BEEN MAKING A BIG CONTRACT IN SOMETHING FIFTY FIFTY
8131-117017-0013 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OVER TWO THOUSAND CREDITS IN THAT WALLET
8131-117017-0014 WHEN GORDON AND JENKINS CAME BACK MURDOCK TOSSED THE MONEY TO THEM
8131-117017-0015 WHATEVER COMES TO HAND
8131-117017-0016 LIKE THIS SOCIAL CALL GORDON ASKED HIM
8131-117017-0017 THE LITTLE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD HIS ANCIENT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD FACE TURNING SOBER NO
8131-117017-0018 YOU OWE ME SOME BILLS GOVERNOR
8131-117017-0019 SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY CREDITS

8131-117017-0021 A THOUSAND INTERESTS AT TEN PER CENT A WEEK STANDARD RIGHT
8131-117017-0022 GORDON HAD HEARD OF THE FRIENDLY INTEREST CHARGED ON THE SIDE HERE BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WRONG IZZY
8131-117017-0023 HA IZZY TURNED IT OVER AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
8131-117017-0024 NOW SHOW ME WHERE I SIGNED AN AGREEMENT SAYING I'D PAY YOU BACK
8131-117017-0025 FOR A SECOND IZZY'S FACE WENT BLANK THEN HE CHUCKLED
8131-117017-0026 HE PULLED OUT THE PILLS AND HANDED THEM OVER
8131-117017-0027 THANKS IZZY THANKS YOURSELF
8131-117017-0028 THE KID POCKETED THE MONEY FEARFULLY NODDING
8131-117017-0029 THE LITTLE GUY KNEW MARS AS FEW OTHERS DID EVIDENTLY FROM ALL SIDES
8131-117017-0030 AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COPPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN ISSY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USE THE INFORMATION WITH A BEAT SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT TO UPPER BRACKETS HE'D STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS
8131-117017-0031 THE CAPTAIN LOOKED COMPLETELY BEATEN AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM AND DROPPED ON TO THE BENCH
8131-117017-0032 GO ON EXCEPT DAMN IT
8131-117029-0000 THERE WAS A MAN COMING FROM EARTH ON THE SECOND SHIP WHO WOULD SEE HIM
8131-117029-0001 THAT LITTLE PUBLISHER WAS BACK AT THE CRUSADER AGAIN
8131-117029-0002 ONLY GORDON AND SHEOLA WERE LEFT
8131-117029-0003 CREDIT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AGAIN AND THE BUSINESSES WERE OPENED
8131-117029-0004 GORDON CAME TO A ROW OF TEMPORARY BUBBLES INDIVIDUAL DWELLINGS BUILT LIKE A DOME BUT OPAQUE FOR PRIVACY
8131-117029-0005 THEY HAVE BEEN LUCKY
8131-117029-0006 SCHOLBERG'S VOLUNTEERS WERE FAITHFUL NOW
8131-117029-0007 FATT'S PLACE WAS STILL OPEN THOUGH THE CROOKED TABLES HAD BEEN REMOVED GORDON DROPPED TO A STOOL SLIPPING OFF HIS HELMET
8131-117029-0008 HE REACHED AUTOMATICALLY FOR A GLASS OF ETHER NEEDLED BEER
8131-117029-0009 THOUGHT YE'D BE IN THE CHIPS
8131-117029-0010 THAT'S MARS GORDON ECHOED THE OTHER'S COMMENT WHY DON'T YOU PULL OFF THE PLANET FATS YOU COULD GO BACK TO EARTH I'D GUESS THE OTHER NODDED
8131-117029-0011 GUESS A MAN GETS USED TO ANYTHING HELL MAYBE I CAN HIRE SOME BUMS TO SIT AROUND AND WHOOP IT UP WHEN THE SHIPS COME IN AND BILL THIS IS A REAL OLD MARTIAN DEN OF SIN

8188-269288-0020 WELL READ IT IN PEACE SAID LINDSLEY I WON'T DISTURB YOU
8188-269288-0021 I AM GLAD IT HAS COME
8188-269288-0022 LISLIE SEATED HERSELF WITH HER BACK TO HER COMPANION AND OPENED HER OWN LETTERS

8188-269288-0027 JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT SHE AROSE WITH A SIGH TO PREPARE FOR BED
8188-269288-0028 SHE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM
8188-269288-0029 I REMEMBER SHE GOT A LETTER WHICH UPSET HER VERY MUCH AND WENT OUT
8188-269288-0030 LISLIE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND FLUNG IT OPEN SHE PUT HER HEAD OUT AND TRIED TO PEER INTO THE DARKNESS BUT THE MOON HAD ALREADY SET AND SHE COULD NOT SEE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF YARDS IN FRONT OF HER
8188-269288-0031 SHE IS A VERY QUEER ERRATIC CREATURE AND THE LETTER THERE WAS BAD NEWS IN THAT LETTER
8188-269288-0032 WHAT COULD SHE BE DOING OUT BY HERSELF
8188-269288-0033 LISLIE LEFT THE ROOM BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY GONE A DOZEN PLACES DOWN THE CORRIDOR BEFORE SHE MET ANY RETURNING
8188-269288-0034 ANNIE'S EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT HER CHEEKS WERE NO LONGER PALE AND THERE WAS A BRILLIANT COLOR IN THEM
8188-269288-0035 SHE DID NOT TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE OF LIZZIE BUT GOING INTO THE ROOM SHUT THE DOOR
8188-269288-0036 DON'T BEGIN SAID ANNIE
8188-269288-0037 DON'T BEGIN WHAT YOU MEAN
8188-269288-0038 I MEAN I DON'T WANT YOU TO BEGIN TO ASK QUESTIONS
8188-269288-0039 I WALKED UP AND DOWN AS FAST AS EVER I COULD IN ORDER TO MAKE MYSELF SLEEPY
8188-269288-0040 DON'T TALK TO ME LIZZY DON'T SAY A SINGLE WORD

8188-269288-0043 NOW DRINK THIS AT ONCE SHE SAID IN A VOICE OF AUTHORITY IF YOU REALLY WISHED TO SLEEP
8188-269288-0044 ANNA STARED VACANTLY AT THE COCOA THEN SHE UTTERED A LAUGH
8188-269288-0045 DRINK SHE SAID
8188-269288-0046 YOU WANT TO KILL ME DON'T TALK ANY MORE
8188-269288-0047 I'M SLEEPY I SHALL SLEEP
8188-269288-0048 SHE GOT INTO BED AS SHE SPOKE AND WRAPPED THE CLOTHES TIGHTLY AROUND HER
8188-269288-0049 CAN'T YOU MANAGE WITH THE CANDLE JUST FOR ONCE
8188-269288-0050 CERTAINLY CITED EASILY
8188-269288-0051 SHE TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND LIT A CANDLE WHICH HE PUT BEHIND HER SCREEN THEN PREPARED TO GET INTO BED
8188-269288-0052 ANNA'S MANNER WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS
8188-269288-0053 ANNIE DID NOT MEAN TO CONFIDE IN ANYONE THAT NIGHT AND THE KINDEST THING WAS TO LEAVE HER ALONE
8188-269288-0054 TIRED OUT LIZZLIE HERSELF DROPPED ASLEEP
8188-269288-0055 IS THAT YOU SHE CALLED OUT
8188-269288-0056 THERE WAS NO REPLY BUT THE SOUND OF HURRYING STEPS CAME QUICKER AND QUICKER AND THEN THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN
8188-269288-0057 O THIS WILL KILL ME MY HEART WILL BREAK THIS WILL KILL ME
8188-269290-0000 THE GUILD OF SAINT JOSEPH
8188-269290-0001 IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER THAT EVENING LESLIE RAN UP TO HER ROOM TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR HER VISIT TO EAST HALL

8188-269290-0010 WRAPPING A PRETTY BLUE SHAWL ROUND HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS SHE TURNED TO ANNIE
8188-269290-0011 LISLIE WAS JUST CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER WHEN EMNIE CALLED AFTER HER

8188-269290-0016 JANE HARRIOTT'S VOICE WAS HEARD IN THE PASSAGE
8188-269290-0017 AS SHE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR SHE HEARD IT BEING TURNED ON THE LOCK
8188-269290-0018 WHAT CAN THAT MEAN SHE SAID TO HERSELF

8188-269290-0032 SCARCELY LIKELY REPLIED LISLIE SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO COME TO THE MEETING
8188-269290-0033 BUT MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LIZLIE AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
8188-269290-0034 MISS LAUDERALE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHER TUTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE DIFFERENT HALLS ON A RAISED PLATFORM
8188-269290-0035 THEN A ROYAL CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE WAS ANY COLCHESTER
8188-269290-0036 THE PHYSICAL PART OF OUR TRAINING AND ALSO THE MENTAL PART ARE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED IN THIS GREAT HOUSE OF LEARNING SHE CONTINUED BUT THE SPIRITUAL PART IT SEEMS TO ME OUGHT NOW TO BE STRENGTHENED
8188-269290-0037 HEAR HERE AND ONCE AGAIN HERE
8188-269290-0038 SHE UTTERED HER STREAM REMARK STANDING UP
8188-269290-0039 MARJORIE AND EILEEN WERE CLOSE TO HER
8188-269290-0040 I WILL TALK WITH YOU BELLE ARCHISON PRESENTLY SHE SAID
8188-269290-0041 THE NAMES OF THE PROPOSED PAPERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO ME BEFORE THIS DAY WEEK
8188-269290-0042 AM I MY MOTHER'S KEEPER
8188-269290-0043 YOU ASKED SHE CONTINUED
8188-269290-0044 GOD ANSWERS TO EACH OF YOU
8188-269290-0045 THE WORLD SAYS NO I'M NOT BUT GOD SAYS YES YOU ARE
8188-269290-0046 ALL MEN ARE BROTHERS
8188-269290-0047 FOR ALL WHO SIN ALL WHO SUFFER ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RESPONSIBLE
8188-269290-0048 AFTER THE ADDRESS THE BOYS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
8188-269290-0049 IT WAS PAST TEN O'CLOCK WHEN SHE LEFT THE HOUSE
8188-269290-0050 JUST AS SHE WAS DOING SO MISSUS FRERE CAME UP
8188-269290-0051 ANNIE COLCHESTER IS YOUR ROOM FELLOW IS SHE NOT SHE SAID
8188-269290-0052 I SEE BY YOUR FACE MISS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DISTRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING ARE YOU KEEPING ANYTHING BACK
8188-269290-0053 I'M AFRAID I AM REPLIED LIZZIE DISTRESSED NOW IN HER TONE
8188-269290-0054 I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS LORDERDALE EXCEPT A VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED HERSELF
8188-269290-0055 EXCUSES MADE NO DIFFERENCE
8188-269290-0056 THE GIRL WHO BREAKS THE RULES HASS TO BE PUNISHED
8188-269290-0057 I WOULD TELL HER
8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHEN THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTERESTS AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MONTMORES OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICIALS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE CAPITAL AND CONDEMNED THE NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0004 WERE THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER IT
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW A FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME BEFORE MYSELF
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION WAKE THOSE SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UP A COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVE LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALL FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0007 HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH
8188-274364-0008 MY LORDS I HAVE NOW TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIP A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG VANE FALLING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THE MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO PYM WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY AND HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL PERMIT
8280-266249-0000 MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILWAY CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOR
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL AROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0004 THERE IS SOME NICE LOOKING PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0005 BESIDE OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RONALD LAUGHING
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ANSWERED THAT LITTLE GROUP YONDER THE YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I SUPPOSE
8280-266249-0007 WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR HERALD I SHOULD JUDGE
8280-266249-0008 YOU SON WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009 HE CERTAINLY LOOKED LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE BOY
8280-266249-0010 YOU AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRANK
8280-266249-0011 I DO INDEED THOUGH PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF THE AILMENTS
8280-266249-0012 DOUBTLESS THIS IS THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMAN'S CABIN WHERE THERE IS A LIGHT
8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT OF TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF THE DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAINS SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0017 IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND ALIMENTS
8280-266249-0018 THE FRENCH POLYTECHNICA INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS UPON THE MIND
8280-266249-0019 NOTE THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEWERS
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN A CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0021 BUT THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0022 HENCE THE RESORT TO CIDER AND BEER
8280-266249-0023 NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN
8280-266249-0024 FOR YE ARE BOUGHT WITH THE PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GODS
8280-266249-0025 WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR HOUSES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LOVING SACRIFICE WHOLLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALY
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0030 THEY'RE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0031 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN THE DIRECTION
8280-266249-0032 NO SIR HE IS NOT THERE
8280-266249-0033 THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TOO
8280-266249-0034 NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED ON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0035 HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING TO HIS STATE ROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0036 WHAT DOES IT MEAN SAID ONE
8280-266249-0037 A VENTRILOQUIST OF BOARD OF COURSE RETURNED ANOTHER LET'S FOLLOW AND SEE THE FUN
8280-266249-0038 I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REMARKED THE FIRST LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT GO ON
8280-266249-0039 THAT FELLOW NICK WARDE IS A NOTED BLACK LEG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE
8280-266249-0040 WHO ASKED THE MATE I'VE SEEN NONE UP HERE THOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THE STEERAGE
8280-266249-0041 THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH THE COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8280-266249-0042 A MAN OF GIGANTIC SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0043 LET ME GO YELLED WARDE MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIS ARMS
8280-266249-0044 I DINKS NO I DINKS I DID YOU VON LASSEN RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
8280-266249-0045 THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS ON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0046 MISTER LIILBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0047 THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSION
8280-266249-0048 THEY KEPT IT UP UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT
8280-266249-0049 THEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN HIS STATE ROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0050 AND INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STAKES WERE VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0051 THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREEN BAGS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THAT DREAD SOUND
8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WERE SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS WITH A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
8280-266249-0054 IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED WARD LOOK WHAT'S THERE LOOK
8280-266249-0055 WHAT CAN IT HA BEEN THEY ASKED EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0056 O NONSENSE WHAT FOOLS WE ARE
8280-266249-0057 IT WAS THE LAST GAME OF CARDS FOR THE TRIP
8280-266249-0058 THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0059 TO LUCY'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DAILIES WERE IN VERY STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0060 OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THE TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE
8280-266249-0061 AND HOW WONDERFULLY HE HAD ANSWERED OUR PETITIONS
8280-266249-0062 ELSIE ANSWERED PRESSING HER HANDS AFFECTIONATELY ARE WE NOT SISTERS IN CHRIST
8280-266249-0063 YOU ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD BY FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
8280-266249-0064 YOU ARE ALL ONE IN CHRIST JESUS
8280-266249-0065 WE FEEL MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE ARE ONLY THE STEWARDS OF HIS BOUNTY AND BECAUSE HE HAS SAID INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME IT IS THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE AND DELIGHT TO DO ANY THING FOR HIS PEOPLE
8461-258277-0000 IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTEENTH NIGHT
8461-258277-0001 BUT HE ANSWERED NEEDS MUST THOU HAVE ZANAB LL SAY NOW SUDDENLY THERE CAME A RAP AT THE DOOR AND THE MAID SAID WHO IS AT THE DOOR
8461-258277-0002 THE KNOCKER REPLIED KAMAH DAUGHTER OF AZARIAH THE JEW SAY ME ISALI OF CAIRO WITH YOU
8461-258277-0003 REPLIED THE BROKER'S DAUGHTER OH THOU DAUGHTER OF A DOG
8461-258277-0004 AND HAVING THUS ISLAMIZED SHE ASKED HIM TWO MEN IN THE FAITH OF AL ISLAM GIVE MARRIAGE PORTIONS TO WOMEN OR DO WOMEN DOWER MEN
8461-258277-0005 SHE THREW DOWN THE JEW'S HEAD BEFORE HIM
8461-258277-0006 THE CAUSE OF HER SLAYING HER SIRE WAS AS FOLLOWS
8461-258277-0007 THEN HE SET OUT REJOICING TO RETURN TO THE BARRACK O THE FORTY
8461-258277-0008 SO HE ATE AND FELL DOWN SENSELESS FOR THE SWEET MEATS WERE DRUGGED WITH BANG WHEREUPON THE KAZI BUNDLED HIM INTO THE SACK AND MADE OFF WITH THEM CHARGER AND CHESS AND ALL TO THE BARCO DE FORTE
8461-258277-0009 PRESENTLY HASAN SCHUMANN CAME OUT OF A CLOSET AND SAID TO HIM HAST THOU GOT THE GEAR O ALI
8461-258277-0010 SO HE TOLD HIM WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM AND ADDED IF I KNOW WHITHER THE RASCAL IS GONE AND WHERE TO FIND THE KNAVE I WILL PAY HIM OUT
8461-258277-0011 KNOWST THOU WHITHER HE WENT
8461-258277-0012 ASKED HASAN I KNOW WHERE HE IS AND OPENING THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET SHOWED HIM THE SWEETMEAT CELLAR WITHIN DRUGGED AND SENSELESS
8461-258277-0013 SO I WENT ROUND ABOUT THE HIGHWAYS OF THE CITY UNTIL I MET A SWEETMEAT SELLER AND BUYING HIS CLOTHES AND STOCK IN TRADE AND GEAR FOR TEN DINARS DID WHAT WAS DONE
8461-258277-0014 QUOTH RASHID WHOSE HEAD IS THIS
8461-258277-0015 SO ALI RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT PASSED FROM FIRST TO LAST AND THE CALIPH SAID I HAD NOT THOUGHT THOU WOULDST KILL HIM FOR THAT HE WAS A SORCERER
8461-258277-0016 HE REPLIED I HAVE FORTY LADS AND THEY ARE IN CAIRO
8461-278226-0000 AND LAURA HAD HER OWN PLANS
8461-278226-0001 SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED A SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JUVIN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMISE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-278226-0003 I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES THE PICTURES ESPECIALLY
8461-278226-0004 I REMEMBER ALL THE REUBENS AT THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
8461-278226-0005 SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH POOR GREY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AYESHA BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0006 IT WAS DRAWING TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0007 BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANY THING SHE HAD SEEN IN THE GALLERY
8461-278226-0008 PHILIP JOCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HE HIS WIFE MADE THE DISCOVERY
8461-278226-0009 HOW I WISH HE COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE PHILIP LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
8461-278226-0010 I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MORNING ROOM AT JOCELYN STROCH
8461-278226-0011 SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ARTIST PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KIRSTOOL LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
8461-278226-0012 THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
8461-278226-0013 BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARD THE WORKS OF OTHERS
8461-278226-0014 I DON'T THINK HE WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HOUSE
8461-278226-0015 YOU WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOUR PHILIP IF YOU'LL SAY YES
8461-281231-0000 HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THE UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THE WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS
8461-281231-0001 IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORKELESTONE
8461-281231-0002 AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH A FEAR OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
8461-281231-0003 WHAT ART THOU HE CRIED IN TERROR
8461-281231-0004 LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH EUREA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
8461-281231-0005 EXCLAIMED THE GENTLEMAN HO
8461-281231-0006 REMEMBEREST THOU THE MAGAZINE OF FUEL THAT IS STORED BENEATH THESE APARTMENTS
8461-281231-0007 THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID AURICA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO WOULD EXTINGUISH THEM
8461-281231-0008 MEANTIME THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
8461-281231-0009 THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY DE BRACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
8461-281231-0010 THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCE HIS WAY INWARD IN DESPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
8461-281231-0011 TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE LEADER'S EFFORTS TO STOP THEM
8461-281231-0012 THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL WRUNG WITH THE FURIOUS BLOWS
8461-281231-0013 AT LENGTH THE BRACY FELL
8461-281231-0014 TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK THY PLEASURES ON ME
8461-281231-0015 YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPARTS THEE TO KNOW
8461-281231-0016 EXCLAIMED A BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER AND PERISH
8461-281231-0017 THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAMBER
8461-281231-0018 RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH EASE THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS
8461-281231-0019 BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT FROM DE BOEUF
8461-281231-0020 AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE UUREA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
8461-281231-0021 BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND ROSE THROUGH THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTER
8461-281231-0022 AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH CONSUMED HER TYRANT
8461-281231-0023 WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORKLESTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
8461-281231-0024 HE LEFT A GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF KONIGSBURG AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ADDLESTANE WAS LAID
8461-281231-0025 DEBRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOOD
8461-281231-0026 HERE IS THE BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT AS A MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING
8461-281231-0027 SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS STRONG HORSE AND RODE OFF THROUGH THE FOREST
8461-281231-0028 DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER
8461-281231-0029 WITH THIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
8461-281231-0030 THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FRONT DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
8461-281231-0031 HE APPEALED TO DE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
8461-281231-0032 BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LYCAS THE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY
8461-281231-0033 HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONG THEM
8461-281231-0034 POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PREMIPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK AROUND AND TO MARK INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
8461-281231-0036 SHE GAZED ACCORDINGLY ON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
8461-281231-0037 AT HIS FEET WAS PLACED THE TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
8461-281231-0038 THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THE SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
