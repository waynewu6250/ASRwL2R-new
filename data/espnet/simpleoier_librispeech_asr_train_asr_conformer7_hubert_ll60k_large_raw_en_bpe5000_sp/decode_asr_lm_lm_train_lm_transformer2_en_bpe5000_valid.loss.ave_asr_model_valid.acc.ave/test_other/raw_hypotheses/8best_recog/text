1688-142285-0000 THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT THESE HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHEWING HIS GUESTS DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A BOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY IN HELSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD DONE
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS WITH SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 THIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THIS DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF HEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARD TO HELP THE MOTHER AND BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO FRIENDS CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISTER THORNTON IS NOT WONT I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY FOUND MILTON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED ANSWERED HER FATHER
1688-142285-0016 OH PAPA BY THAT TESTING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE AMERICAN POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID IT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS FRIENDS
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS CORRECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENTS WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER OFF IT CAME
1688-142285-0024 MADAM I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0025 IF I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0026 PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AT ALL
1688-142285-0027 I WON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0028 SO GOOD NIGHT CHILD
1688-142285-0029 THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HILL
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN THE BED ROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD COME INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS THE SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THIS MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERSONAL ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVEN DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOP TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL MISSY HOW ARE YE
1688-142285-0038 BETTER IF NOT BETTER IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
1688-142285-0039 NOT EXACTLY CRIED MARGARET SMILING
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED OF MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND OF BOOLAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AN I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED ROUND TO WALK LONG SIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARDS
1688-142285-0042 SO FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0043 AT LEAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
1688-142285-0044 BETSY DO YOU WISH TO DIE
1688-142285-0045 BETSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED
1688-142285-0046 NOR WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
1688-142285-0047 FOR WHAT WAS IT
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE BUT PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON
1688-142285-0049 I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THIS TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
1688-142285-0050 I COULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW
1688-142285-0051 THE SOFTNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY TURNED OFF INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
1688-142285-0053 YOU'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GROPISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0054 BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY STARTED
1688-142285-0055 GASPED BUSSY AT LAST
1688-142285-0056 BESSEY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT WAS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT YOU AND MAKE IT WHAT IT IS
1688-142285-0059 NOW I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED INTO
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU REMEMBER IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0061 I GIVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
1688-142285-0062 IT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG WOMAN
1688-142285-0063 I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I SEE NO NOT BY A BIG DEAL
1688-142285-0064 BUT WHO'S COME AT LAST AND WHO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HE'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT YOU KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT
1688-142285-0065 IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NO HARD TO WORK
1688-142285-0066 BUT THE GIRL ANY PLAYED IT THE MORE WITH MARGARET
1688-142285-0067 DON'T THINK HARDLY UPON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
1688-142285-0068 I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOWED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF ARTHUR IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0069 THE FEVERISH COLOR CAME INTO HER CHEEKS AND THE FEVERISH FLAME TO HER EYE
1688-142285-0070 AND YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL OH MY HEART
1688-142285-0071 SHE PUT HER HAND ON IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALE
1688-142285-0072 MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PULLED THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
1688-142285-0073 PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SPOKE
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED IT'S THE BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
1688-142285-0075 I SHALL COME TO MORROW SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0076 ROBERT WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
1688-142285-0077 AND SHE WAS LATE FOR TEA AT HOME
1688-142285-0078 HAVE YOU MET WITH A SWORD DEAR
1688-142285-0079 NO MAMMA THAT ANNE BUCKLEY WOULD HAVE DONE
1688-142285-0080 S'POSE I CRY SAID MISTER HALE
1688-142285-0081 EVERYTHING ELSE HAS HAD THEIR TURN AT THIS GREAT DIFFICULTY NOW LET ME TRY
1688-142285-0082 I MAY BE THE CINDERELLA TO PUT ON THAT SLIPPER AFTER ALL
1688-142285-0083 WHAT WOULD YOU DO PA HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT IT
1688-142285-0084 WELL I I WOULD APPLY TO SOME GOOD HOUSEMOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS
1688-142285-0085 VERY GOOD BUT WE MUST FIRST CATCH MY HOUSE MOTHER
1688-142285-0086 HIS MOTHER OF WHOM HE SPOKE TO US SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0087 MISTER THORNTON THE ONLY OTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HALE QUIETLY
1688-142285-0088 I MUST LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
1688-142285-0089 SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
1688-142285-0090 SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANOTHER ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
1688-142285-0091 MY DEAR SAID MISTER HALE ALARMED PRAY DON'T GO OFF ON THIS IDEA
1688-142285-0092 I AM SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
1688-142285-0093 TAKE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT
1688-142285-0094 I DON'T KNOW POSITIVELY THAT IT IS HERS EITHER BUT FROM LITTLE THINGS I HAVE GATHERED FROM HER I FANCY SO
1688-142285-0095 I CARED TOO LITTLE TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER

1998-29454-0003 HE GOT IT UP AND PUSHED HIS TREASURES AS FAR IN AS HE COULD ALONG THE ROUGH CRUMBLY SURFACE OF THE LASH AND PLASTER
1998-29454-0004 WHEN DICKIE CAME DOWN HIS AUNT SLIGHTLY SLAPPED HIM AND HE TOOK A HALFPENNY AND LIMPED OFF OBEDIENTLY

1998-29455-0037 NOR WAS IT SUNDAY ON WHICH THEY TOOK A REST AND WASHED THEIR SHIRTS ACCORDING TO MISTER BEED'S RULE OF LIFE

2033-164914-0007 AND HE ALSO IMPROVISED THE FOLLOWING DISTICHS
2033-164914-0008 WHEN NUSHAD AL ZAMAN HEARD THE FIRST IMPROVISATION SHE CALLED TO MIND HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER AND HER BROTHER AND THEIR WILLUM HOME THEN SHE WEPT AND CRIED TO THE EUNUCH AND SAID TO HIM WOE TO THEE

2033-164914-0014 BUT THE EUNUCH SAID I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE TILL THOU SHOW ME WHO IT WAS THAT RECITED THE VERSES FOR I DREAD RETURNING TO MY FATHER WITHOUT HIM
2033-164914-0015 NOW WHEN THE FIRE MAN HEARD THESE WORDS HE FEARED FOR ZAL AL MAKAN AND WEPT WITH EXCEEDING WEEPING AND SAID TO THE EUNUCH BY ALLAH IT WAS NOT I AND I KNOW HIM NOT

2033-164914-0019 THEN SAID THE EUNUCH TO ZAAL MAKAN PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY LORD
2033-164914-0020 O MY LORD CONTINUED THE EUNUCH BUT SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY

2033-164915-0000 AND ALTOGETHER THESE
2033-164915-0001 THEN SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HE GATHERED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN FELL IN A FAINTING FIT
2033-164915-0002 WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW THIS HE WONDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEWHAT TO COVER THEM WAITED TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
2033-164915-0003 AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND UZSAT AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LEFT HER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THESE VERSES
2033-164915-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANTS HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM BUT HOW HE HAD GOT FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BUYING HE HAD MADE A MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD GONE IN TO HER AND HOW THE KING THEIR SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARRKAN
2033-164915-0005 BUT NOW GO TO THY MASTER AND BRING HIM QUIETLY TO ME
2033-164915-0006 THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED A CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO ACCORDINGLY SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE STALKER TILL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRDING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
2033-164915-0007 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE STALKER GIRDED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING O WOULD I KNEW WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM
2033-164915-0008 I BELIEVE HE HATH DENOUNCED ME TO THE EUNUCH HENCE THESE PAGES AT ME AND HE HATH MADE ME AN ACCOMPLICE IN HIS CRIME

2033-164915-0011 TWAS AS I FEARED THE COMING ILL'S DISCERNING BUT UNTO ALLAH WE ARE ALL RETURNING
2033-164915-0012 THEN THE EUNUCH CRIED UPON THE PAGES SAYING TAKE THEM OFF THE ASS
2033-164915-0013 AND HE ANSWERED I AM THE CHAMBERLAIN OF THE AMIR OF DAMASCUS KING SHARRKAN SON OF OMAR BIN AL NUMAN LORD OF BAGDAD AND OF THE LAND OF KHORASAN AND I BRING TRIBUTE AND PRESENTS FROM HIM TO HIS FATHER IN BAGDAD
2033-164915-0014 SO FARE YE FORWARDS NO HARM SHALL BEFALL YOU TILL YE JOIN THIS GRAND WAZIR DANDAN
2033-164915-0015 THEN HE BADE HIM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO KING OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND THE TRIBUTES OF SYRIA
2033-164915-0016 SO IT WAS AGREED THAT WE WOULD GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARRKAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHER'S REALM
2033-164915-0017 AND AMONGST THEM WERE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE CADET ZAU AL MAKAN FOR QUOTH THEY HIS NAME BE LIGHT OF THE PLACE AND HE HATH A SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HAIS THE DELIGHT OF THE TIME BUT THEY SET OUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOR ALHIJAZ AND NONE WOTTETH WHAT IS BECOME OF THEM
2033-164916-0000 SO HE TURNED TO THE WAZIR DUNAN AND SAID TO HIM VERILY YOUR TALE IS A WONDER OF WONDERS
2033-164916-0001 KNOW O CHIEF WAZIR THAT HERE WHERE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED ME ALLAH HATH GIVEN YOU REST FROM FATIGUE AND BRINGETH YOU YOUR DESIRE AFTER THE EASIEST OF FASHIONS FOR THAT HIS ALMIGHTY WILL RESTORETH TO YOU ZAUMA KHAN AND HIS SISTER NUSHAD AL ZAMAN WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN
2033-164916-0002 WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAYNE TELL ME THE TALES OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFELL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
2033-164916-0003 ZAUMA KHAN BOWED HIS HEAD AWHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THE POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM ON THE RIGHT WAY
2033-164916-0004 THEN HE ADDED O MY UNCLE HOW SHALL I DO WITH MY BROTHER SHARVAN
2033-164916-0005 AFTER A WHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE FULL TIDE SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
2033-164916-0006 WHERE IT WAS THE SEVENTY EIGHTH NIGHT
2033-164916-0007 AND IN IT ALL REJOICED AT THE ACCESSION OF THE LIGHT OF THAT PLACE
2033-164916-0008 LASTLY THE MINISTER WENT IN AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE ZA AL MAKAN WHO ROSE TO MEET HIM SAYING WELCOME O WAZIR AND SIRE'S SONSPIER
2033-164916-0009 MOREOVER THE SULTAN COMMANDED HIS WAZIR DANDAN CALL A TEN DAYS HALT OF THE ARMY THAT HE MIGHT BE WITH HIM AND LEARN FROM HIM HOW AND WHEREFORE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN SLAIN
2033-164916-0010 THEY THEN REPAIRED TO THE HEART OF THE ENCAMPMENT AND ORDERED THE HOST TO HALT TEN DAYS
2414-128291-0000 THAT HATH HAPPENED UNTO ME
2414-128291-0001 HE ASKED HIMSELF SOMETHING WARM AND LIVING QUICKENETH ME IT MUST BE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
2414-128291-0002 WHEN HOWEVER ZATHUSTRA WAS QUITE NIGH UNTO THEM THEN DID HE HEAR PLAINLY THAT A HUMAN VOICE SPAKE IN THE MIDST OF THE CAIRN AND APPARENTLY ALL OF THEM HAD TURNED THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THE SPEAKER
2414-128291-0003 WHAT I HERE SEEK
2414-128291-0004 ANSWERED HE THE SAME THAT THOU SEEKEST THOU MISCHIEF MAKERS THAT IS TO SAY HAPPINESS UPON EARTH

2414-128291-0019 THEY ALSO ABSTAIN FROM ALL HEAVY WORDS WHICH INFLATE THE HEART
2414-128291-0020 AND THEN
2414-128291-0021 SAID ZARATHUSTRA THOU SHOULDST ALSO SEE MINE ANIMALS MINE EAGLE AND MY SERPENT ALIKE DO NOT AT PRESENT EXIST ON EARTH
2414-128291-0022 AND TALKS TO MINE ANIMALS OF THE HAPPINESS OF ANIMALS

2414-128292-0004 THUS SPAKE THAT TOO STRAIGHT TO HIS HEART AND RAN AWAY
2414-128292-0005 VERILY MY BODY HAD GROWN BIG IN THE MOUNTAINS
2414-128292-0006 NOW DID I HEAR SIX OLD FOOL'S LEGS RATTLING BEHIND ONE ANOTHER
2414-128292-0007 BUT DOTH ZATHUSTRA NEED TO BE FRIGHTENED BY A SHADOW
2414-128292-0008 ALSO METHINKETH THAT AFTER ALL IT HATH LONGER A LESS THAN MINE
2414-128292-0009 FOR WHEN THE ATUSTRA SCRUTINIZED HIM WITH THIS GLANCE HE WAS FRIGHTENED AS BY A SUDDEN APPARITION SO SLENDER SWARTHY HOLLOW AND WORN OUT DID HIS FOLLOWER APPEAR
2414-128292-0010 ASKED DOSTRA VEHEMENTLY WHAT DOEST THOU HERE

2414-128292-0016 THE DEVIL HIMSELF IS PERHAPS MINE
2414-128292-0017 SOMETIMES I MEANT TO FLY AND BEHOLD
2414-128292-0018 AND ONLY DID I HIT THE TRUTH
2414-128292-0019 HOW HAS I STILL INCLINATION
2414-128292-0020 HAVE I STILL A GOAL
2414-128292-0021 A HAVEN TOWARDS WHICH MY SAIL IS SENT
2414-128292-0022 FOR IT TOO I ASK AND SEEK AND HAVE SOUGHT BUT I HAD NOT FOUND IT
2414-128292-0023 OH ETERNAL EVERY WHERE OH ETERNAL NOWHERE OH ETERNAL IN VAIN
2414-128292-0024 THAT ART MY SHADOW
2414-128292-0025 SAID HE AT THE LAST SADLY
2414-128292-0026 THY DANGER IS NOT SMALL THOU FREE BIRD AND WANDERER
2414-128292-0027 THEY SLEEP QUIETLY THEY'LL ENJOY THEIR NEW SECURITY
2414-128292-0028 BEWARE LEST IN THE END A NARROW FAITH CAPTURE THEE A HEART RIGOROUS DELUSION
2414-128292-0029 BUT NOW EVERYTHING THAT IS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTETH THEE
2414-128292-0030 THOU HAST SOUGHT THY GOAL
2414-128292-0031 THOU POOR ROVERS AND RAMBLER THOU TIRED BUTTERFLY
2414-128292-0032 WILT THOU HAVE A REST IN HER HOME THIS EVENING
2414-159411-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAHMIN WHO WAS WALKING ON THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM
2414-159411-0001 THE BRAHMIN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THE CAGE YOU'LL EAT ME
2414-159411-0002 O FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN THE TRUTH THAT I WILL NOT
2414-159411-0003 I WOULD NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND RETURN
2414-159411-0004 THEN THE BRAMIN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARD
2414-159411-0005 SO THE BRAHMIN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A GIANT TREE AND THE BRAHMIN SAID TO IT BANNANT TREE BANNON TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0006 ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE DEPENDANT TREE
2414-159411-0007 THIS TIGER SAID THE BRAMIN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF THIS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LET HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME
2414-159411-0008 IT IS JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OH NO
2414-159411-0009 LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR THEY ARE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE
2414-159411-0010 SIR CAMEL SIR CAMEL CRIED A BRAHMAN HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0011 AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND A BULLOCK LYING BY A ROADSIDE
2414-159411-0012 IS IT FAIR THAT SHE SHOULD DO SO OR NOT
2414-159411-0013 LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR THE MEN HAVE NO PITY
2414-159411-0014 THREE OUT OF THE SIX AND GIVING JUDGMENT AGAINST A BRAHMIN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINED TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
2414-159411-0015 ON WHAT MUST I HAVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE EAGLE
2414-159411-0016 THE BRAHMIN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMBED THE ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONES
2414-159411-0017 THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID JUDGMENT OF ALL IS AGAINST YOU O BRAMIN
2414-159411-0018 AFTER THAT THEY SAW AN ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMIN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE VERDICT
2414-159411-0019 BUT THE ALLIGATORS SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MAN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KILL ME
2414-159411-0020 THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINION OF THAT SIXTH JUDGE
2414-159411-0021 NO SIXTH WAS A JACKAL
2414-159411-0022 THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKAL UNCLE JACKAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGEMENT
2414-159411-0023 SHOW ME THE PAST
2414-159411-0024 AND THE GUARD THERE THE JAKALS SAID NOW BRAHMIN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD
2414-159411-0025 EXACTLY IT WAS IT ASKED THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0026 EXACTLY HE REPLIED THE BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0027 WHERE IS THE TIGER THEN
2414-159411-0028 WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE TIGER JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON THE SIDE
2414-159411-0029 VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL AND I CANNOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY
2414-159411-0030 SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THAT BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0031 THAT SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0032 WHEN THE BRAHMIN HAD DONE THIS THE JACKALS SAID AH YOU WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL TIGER
2414-159411-0033 WHEN A GOOD BRAHMIN OPENED YOUR CASTLE IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WOULD MAKE
2414-159411-0034 PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEY FRIEND BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0035 YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY AND MIND
2414-165385-0000 THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUET AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLATTERING POCAMP BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILISED MONKEY
2414-165385-0001 THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS TENDED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMIC WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU
2609-156975-0000 THEN MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID CERTAINLY THE THING IS KNOWN
2609-156975-0001 HOWDORNE HOPHAST HODOUBT PAYS SINCE HIS GENIUS
2609-156975-0002 LET'S HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MATRON MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET'S THERE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
2609-156975-0003 THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THE BANDAGE
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHOSE TURBANT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KIERNAPATH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIANS SCRIPZONS GIVE OF THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ALTAMI COVETTES INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THEIR TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES PROSTRATE TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDO WERE THE CHIEF FACTORS IN THIS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
2609-156975-0008 THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATIONS OF THE SOJOURN IN EGYPT
2609-156975-0009 THE LATER TRADITIONS SEND TO EXTEND THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY PATHAM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATOM
2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY IN SCRIPT IN ULSTER STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHAM THE HOUSE OF RAMESES A CITY WITH THE ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES
2609-156975-0012 THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS SYRENNY WAS NATURALLY INEVITABLE
2609-156975-0013 WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM IT THE DESPOTIC ROAR OF THAT LAND
2609-156975-0014 THE MAKING OF A HOLY PATRIOT
2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES'S BIRTH OR EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
2609-156975-0016 WHERE IS MOSES JUST FINDIN RESISTIN THE GYPSIN TACT MASTER
2609-156975-0017 IS PINIONAGE ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT COMPOSING IT
2609-156975-0018 NAT TREE HE WENT TO THE LAND OF MIDIAN
2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN A PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTIANS AND FUGITIVES
2609-156975-0020 FROM ABOUT TEN THOUSAND B C
2609-156975-0021 ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOWIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
2609-156975-0022 THESE SOUND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KIDAM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN THEIR TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0024 THE SCORE OF THE WARINESS
2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUAT
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIESTS OF THE SUBTRIBE OF THE CANITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0027 NOTE THE CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF PARIS
2609-156975-0028 THERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS THE LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT UP WITH THE NORTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KINITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAWAY OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GUIDE WAS TRANSLATED BY A LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0031 DO THE EARLIEST SEA BREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0032 THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIS THAT THIS PRIEST MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0033 MOSES IN THE HOUSE OF THE MIDIAN PRIESTS WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0034 THE CRUEL FATES OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
2609-156975-0035 HIS QUEST WAS FOR A JUDTS AND STRONG GONE ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENED HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON THE POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST AND TONIAN PLAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA MINOR SILLE CALL EVERY LIFE GIVING SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
2609-156975-0038 THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCK INTRUSTED TO MOSES'S CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP IN ACTION
2609-157645-0000 EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PRESENT FOR THE ROYAL FOE TO TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
2609-157645-0001 THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGUING QUOD AT A SMOAKING IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
2609-157645-0002 SOMETIMES TOBACCO IS USED IN CHURCHES FOR DISINFECTANT OR DEODORIZING PURPOSES
2609-157645-0003 BLACKBURN ART'S VISIP OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER
2609-157645-0004 ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH NOTTINGHAM FOR A CONFIRMED MASON
2609-157645-0005 ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER DINDNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTERY AT HATTON
2609-157645-0006 PAR WAS SUCH A CONTINUOUS SMOKER THAT ANY ONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HADN'T NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF THE PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENCE
2609-157645-0007 ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITSFIELD HE HANDED MASTER PIPE AND CHANCELLOR THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING HIM PATENT
2609-157645-0008 THEM AND THEM SING ANOTHER PSALM SAID THE CURATE

2609-157645-0012 DAVID DEANE SAVOR DENIED THAT AWE PROVED THIS IRREVERENCE
2609-157645-0013 GOING TO CHURCH SAINT HALE'S IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN A QUAINT ON THE SIGNING
2609-157645-0014 WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND OUT THEY WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
2609-169640-0000 PARROTS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY THE SCEPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE C'EST FOUR OF THEM AND FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE
2609-169640-0001 AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JUST KEPT THE STEERAGEWAY ON THE SHIP
2609-169640-0002 FORTUNATELY THE CHILD WAS NOT ONLY FAT BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS THE LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS IN UNLIVELY DANCE
2609-169640-0003 I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SIP POST HE SPECTS REE IN MODERATE WEATHER
2609-169640-0004 MISTER MARBLE HE I DO B'LIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HINCOOPS BEING LIKE THE SAILORS AS ONE MIGHT SAY BERY ASLEEP
2609-169640-0005 AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE SO FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN THE BOAT
2609-169640-0006 I SING OUT SAIL HO AND CLOSE ABOVE
2609-169640-0007 HE IS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
2609-169640-0008 ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET TO OUR TWO THIS GAVE US THE MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
2609-169640-0009 AS OUR SEATS WERE ALSO LYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT
2609-169640-0010 I SOON SAW BOTH PONTZ AND GLAD ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER
2609-169640-0011 MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS ANSWER AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCALS ABACK
2609-169640-0012 THE PERFECT STILLNESS SUCCEEDED
2609-169640-0013 THE PROS DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED US FAST
2609-169640-0014 I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING PILE TOO AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
2609-169640-0015 KAIT WENT AFT RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
2609-169640-0016 THE STILLNESS THAT REIGNED ON BOTH SIDES WAS THAT OF DEATH
2609-169640-0017 THE GIANT BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME ROUND LIKE A
2609-169640-0018 THE QUESTION WAS NOT WHETHER WE COULD PASS THEM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
2609-169640-0019 THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INCIDENT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE IN THE CLOSEST ENTRANCE TO HIS ORDERS
2609-169640-0020 NOT A SOUL ON BOARD THAT JOHN WAS HURT
2609-169640-0021 ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMAN THE FOUR SIXES TWO AT THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERNMOST PROWER WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
2609-169640-0022 THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN ANGLES
2609-169640-0023 I DOUBT IF WE'D TOUCHED THE MAN IN THE NEAREST PARA
2609-169640-0024 IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD OF HER CANVAS'S BINNED FORE LEAVING THE POORER MOSTENOUS IN HER WAKE
3005-163389-0000 THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHIRBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK FROM THE NOISE
3005-163389-0001 SO SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEAR DOWN THE FENCE
3005-163389-0002 THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY UNCOMFORTABLE
3005-163389-0003 SHRBURN RUN HIS EYE SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUTGAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
3005-163389-0004 THE IRISH MAN'S A COWARD
3005-163389-0005 BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID THE MAN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARK AND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
3005-163389-0006 SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES INTO THE NIGHT WITH A HUNDRED MASKED COWARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
3005-163389-0007 SHE DIDN'T WANT TO COME
3005-163389-0008 BUT A MOB WITHOUT A MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT IS BENEATH PITIFULNESS
3005-163389-0009 NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN UP ACROSS HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS THAT
3005-163389-0010 THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AN THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AN BUCK HARKNESS HE HEALED IT AFTER THEM LOOKING INTOLERABLE CHEAP
3005-163389-0011 I CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL

3005-163389-0013 AND ONE OR TWO WOMEN BEGINNING TO SCREAM
3005-163389-0014 SO THEN THE RING MASTER HE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSE

3005-163399-0015 SO I SAYS TO MYSELF THERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I GOT TO RESK THE TRUTH
3005-163399-0016 I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT HE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE HE COMES
3005-163399-0017 CHILDREN DIDN'T YOU SAY A WORD
3005-163399-0018 I SEE I AM IN A FIX NOW
3005-163399-0019 MISSUS PHELPS HE JUMPS FOR HIM AND SAYS
3005-163399-0020 HAS HE GONE NO SAYS HER HUSBAND
3005-163399-0021 I CAN'T IMAGINE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MAKE ME DREADFUL UNEASY
3005-163399-0022 ONLY SHE SAYS I'M READY TO GO DISTRACTED

3005-163399-0024 OH DON'T DISTRESS ME ANY MORE'N I'M ALREADY DISTURBED
3005-163399-0025 WHY SILAS LOOK YONDER ON THE ROAD AIN'T THAT SOMEBODY COMING
3005-163399-0026 THE OLD GENTLEMAN STARED AND
3005-163399-0027 I HAIN'T NO IDEA WHO IS HE
3005-163399-0028 WAS TOM SAWYER
3005-163399-0029 BIG TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
3005-163399-0030 THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES ON THAT BOAT
3080-5032-0000 BUT I'M HUGELY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MY LADY
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN NOT THE WORST OF HER
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER MANNER AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
3080-5032-0003 WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AS A GARLAND
3080-5032-0004 WELL THE BEST ON'T IT IS THAT I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH WAS STRANGEST
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITH ALL AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
3080-5032-0008 TIS A STRANGE CHANCE AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS A SQUIRE OF DAME'S AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND TO SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0010 I THINK MY YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES OUT WITH HIM
3080-5032-0011 I COULD NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUT THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMEN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOUR PITS AND HAVE HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0014 BUT BESIDES I CAN GIVE YOU OTHER
3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT EXCEPT AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0016 YOU ALL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY RECEIVE IT
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANYONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS A JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMOURS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBORS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN IT UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONE'S SELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE IT WERE FIT FOR YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVED WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAD RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE BUT MUCH MORE COOLLY
3080-5032-0024 AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I KNOWN IT SINCE
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM CHEEK MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETER
3080-5032-0026 HOW KINDLY DID I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHERS IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
3080-5040-0000 WOULD IT WOULD LEAVE ME THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND THE GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD ME ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMASH
3080-5040-0003 I WONDER HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE ANY BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRAND IN A PUBLIC WEDDING TO BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL AND IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH IMPROVEMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTERS TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
3080-5040-0008 MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGON THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED
3080-5040-0009 YOU SEE I CAN GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING
3080-5040-0010 BY THE NEXT I SHALL HAVE GONE INTO KENT AND MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR INTERCOURSE VERY MUCH

3080-5040-0014 INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS COMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNEW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUDGE FOR A MOST EXCELLENT SERVANT AND FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE
3080-5040-0015 YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT INTEND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
3080-5040-0016 I DO NOT FIND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREME WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVED ME
3080-5040-0017 THEN I AM CALLED UPON
3080-5040-0018 DIRECTED FOR OUR MASTER
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHID WHERE YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MORE UPON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS THAN THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING IT
3080-5040-0021 YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE WITH THIS THAT I ESCAPE DROWNING
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WRITE BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0023 HOW WELCOME YOULL BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT HAPPINESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGHED TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT THEIR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS WHILE WE HAVE TIME
3080-5040-0027 WHILE IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
3080-5040-0028 WILL BE SO GOOD NATURED
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND IT IS THE FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU LESS WITH DISCOURSES OF THE FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER REASON OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OF HER AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO SPEAK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASE CAR WITH NINE PEAS IN IT UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PAT INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
3331-159605-0001 THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MORE MERIT
3331-159605-0002 I'VE TRIED IT AND LIKE IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAYS YES
3331-159605-0004 BUT A SPITEFUL THING I AM
3331-159605-0005 I DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 LET ME SAY HOW CAN I BEGIN
3331-159605-0007 HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAVE A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENTS OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WIFE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH PEOPLE ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO ANYONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED SPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLATTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
3331-159605-0014 POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THAT LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SIZE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BLACKIE AND BESS BUT COULD NOT RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FANNY THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DONKEY BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASSA CHARLIE'S HAND MISS MAMMY AND WALK PRETTY LIKE BILLIE AND FLOSSIE SAID THE MAID
3331-159605-0019 AT THE STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOLBOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLE HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT HERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HER AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE ROOFS ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HER FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY WITH THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0025 THANK YOU NOT
3331-159605-0026 HOW UGLY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0027 ASKED A ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS WE RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
3331-159605-0029 SO WHEN SHE MADE THE LAST BUOYANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I AM GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WHILE LIKE LEVERLY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE COULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVORITE WALK UNTIL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 WORKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL BUT IS THE NEWS WITH YOU
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS SHE'LL TELL HIM
3331-159605-0035 EITHER DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MINNIE SAYS THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PODDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBERS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAD NOT HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0038 DON'T THINK HE MEANS TO
3331-159605-0039 REALLY JULIE FAN
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT THEY DID
3331-159605-0041 BUT I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
3331-159605-0042 I JUST GAVE HIM A HINT AN HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THEN THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT SIDDY TATTLES SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHAMELAMAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT MAGGIE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0046 I'M OLD YOU KNOW AND PREFERRED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE JOHN WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WHITEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOW BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAY
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL OF THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKED TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NO I AM ONLY TIRED HAS A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR HE IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DO SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0008 THANKS HEAVEN FOR THAT
3331-159609-0009 CRIED POLLY WITH HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0010 PAUL POLLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELLY FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT A SORT OF CHOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO KISS BEFORE
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER IN ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATED THEIR RESPECTIVE VERES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID HENRY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE'S ANY THING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED ON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT EVENING FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARDS MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OF A BOOK OR SWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORES
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED IT MOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED A WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 PENNY CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF THE WORKBASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
3528-168656-0000 SHE HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE A REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN THESE NAMES IN EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR THAT SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUCIBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOLGIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THE VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF FONTRE DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0006 SHE COULD NOT SHOW THIS OBJECT TO ANY ONE
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT TO ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENT
3528-168656-0008 SOME UNIQUE CHAPLET AND SOME AUTHENTIC RELIC
3528-168656-0009 THESE LOST THEMSELVES IN CONJECTURES
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY HURRIED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT THE DANCER IS LAUGHING WITH THE SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0012 MORAL LOVE CONQUERED WITH THE COLIC
3528-168669-0000 THE PRIORESS RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE AT HER CHAIR
3528-168669-0001 WE WILL PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF A DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0002 FATHER FAUVENT
3528-168669-0003 REVEREND MOTHER DO YOU KNOW THE CHAP
3528-168669-0004 AND YOU HAVE BEEN OF THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
3528-168669-0005 THERE IS A STONE TO BE USED HEAVY
3528-168669-0006 TO SLAP OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0007 THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT IS
3528-168669-0008 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN OF IT
3528-168669-0009 A GENTLEMAN IS NEVER A MAN
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DAME BABYLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLONUS HORSES ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERLINUS HORSES NEITHER DO I
3528-168669-0011 MERIT CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS A DOCKYARD
3528-168669-0012 AND A WOMAN IS A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0013 THEN CAN YOU GET A LEVER
3528-168669-0014 THERE IS A RING OF THE STONE
3528-168669-0015 I WILL PUT THE LEVER TO IT
3528-168669-0016 THAT IS MY REVEREND MOTHER I WILL OPEN THE VAULT
3528-168669-0017 WILL THAT BE ALL THAT
3528-168669-0018 GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS A VERY REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0019 VAUVENT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
3528-168669-0020 I AM HERE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WISHED
3528-168669-0021 AND TO HOLD YOUR PEACE ABOUT EVERY THING YES RAVEN MOTHER
3528-168669-0022 WHEN THE VAULT IS BROKEN I WILL CLOSE IT AGAIN
3528-168669-0023 BUT FOR THAT WHAT REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0024 FATHER FERUVIN REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0025 YOU KNOW THAT YOUR MOTHER DIED THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0026 NO DID YOU NOT HEAR THAT BELL
3528-168669-0027 NOTHING CAN BE HEARD AT THE BOTTOM OF A GARDEN REALLY
3528-168669-0028 AND THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN YOUR DIRECTION THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0029 IT WAS NEVER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN PRAYER AH
3528-168669-0031 THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER INTO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW
3528-168669-0032 A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEATH ROOM MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0033 Y MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0034 WHAT CAN YOU SAY
3528-168669-0035 I SAY MORE OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN YOU
3528-168669-0036 REVERED MOTHER I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT I SAID MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0037 BUT I DID NOT SAY MUCH OFTEN
3528-168669-0038 IN THAT MOMENT NINE O'CLOCK STRUCK
3528-168669-0039 AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT ALL HOURS PRAISED AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR SAID THE PIOUS
3528-168669-0040 IT CUT MORE SUDDEN SHORT
3528-168669-0041 FAUCHELEVENT MOPPED HIS FOREHEADS
3528-168669-0042 IN HER LIFETIME MARGARET CRUCIFIXION MADE CONVERTS AFTER HER DEATH SHE WILL PERFORM MIRACLES SHE WILL
3528-168669-0043 FATHER FAUGUIN THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0044 SHE MAINTAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT
3528-168669-0045 SHE GAVE US OUR LAST COMMANDS
3528-168669-0046 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HER PLACE SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0047 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT THOUGHT
3528-168669-0048 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORSON WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING
3528-168669-0049 FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PIECE SHE WENT ON
3528-168669-0050 I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABOURING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THAT CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT
3528-168669-0051 FORTUNATELY THE PRISES COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT
3528-168669-0052 SHE CONTINUED FATHER FERVIN
3528-168669-0053 OH YES REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0054 SAINT TERENTIUS BISHOP OF PORTE WHERE THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER EMPTIES INTO THE SEA REQUESTED THAT ON HIS TOMB MIGHT BE ENGRAVED THE SIGN WHICH WAS PLACED ON THE GRAVES OF PARASITES IN THE HOPE THAT PASSERS BY WOULD SPIT ON HIS TOMB THIS WAS DONE
3528-168669-0055 THE DEVIL MUST BE OBEYED SO BE IT
3528-168669-0056 FOR THAT MATTER NO REVEREND FATHER
3528-168669-0057 FATHER FAUVAIN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION WILL BE INTERRED IN THE COFFIN IN WHICH SHE HAD SLEPT FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT IS JUST
3528-168669-0058 IT IS A CONTINUATION OF THEIR SLUMBER
3528-168669-0059 SO I SHALL HAVE TO NAIL UP THAT COFFIN HERE

3528-168669-0066 YOU SHALL HAVE AN IRON BAR YES BUT
3528-168669-0067 YOU WILL RAISE THAT STONE WITH THE BAR BY MEANS OF THE RING BUT
3528-168669-0068 THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED TO BE BURIED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF A CHAPEL NOT TO GO TO PROFANE EARTH TO REMAIN THERE IN DEATH WHERE SHE PRAYED WHILE LIVING SUCH WAS THE LAST WISH OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0069 SHE ASKED IT OF US THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDED
3528-168669-0070 FOR IT IS FORBIDDEN
3528-168669-0071 NO I AM A STONE IN YOUR WALLS
3528-168669-0072 THINK FATHER FERVAND IF SHE WERE TO WORK MIRACLES HERE
3528-168669-0073 WHAT A GLORY OF GOD FOR THE COMMUNITY AND MIRACLES ISSUED FROM TOMBS
3528-168669-0074 BUT REVEREND MOTHER IT'S THE AGENT OF THE SANITARY COMMISSION

3528-168669-0079 THE PRIORESS WHO WAS USUALLY SUBJECTED TO THE BARRIER OF SILENCE AND WHOSE RESERVOIR WAS OVER FULL ROSE AND EXCLAIMED WITH THE LOQUACITY OF A DEMON WHICH HAS BROKEN AWAY

3528-168669-0130 I SHALL MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES IN DESSERT DISHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WET AND FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 AND TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THAT LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM WHICH HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SUN TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOT GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM FOR THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON A COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUPS WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN IN A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGES AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUITS PASTE ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THERE ARE PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUIT AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT I MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHILE THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUASINE
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER WHEN THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERT
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023 ISSIS
3538-142836-0024 AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED
3538-142836-0025 THE SPATTTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PREVENT INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE IN A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MANS CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HER SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME GIRL SAYS THE HEAD
3538-163619-0004 AND WHEN THE KING TURNED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THE YOUTH PROMISED TO TAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF LAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY FATHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 WHAT'S MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAID CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND CAUGHT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON THEE LOVELY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NOT AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND HER GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THE HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOURS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE HOLES AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE MORNING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE DUKE
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID AND NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS MOTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN A ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTIFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME THITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF ON A CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HAND ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SYD DE LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BOYS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDER LADD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF THE PLACE SAID SINDER LAD
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID SINDA LAD
3538-163622-0014 AND THUS WE JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE BULL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID SINDER LADS
3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRUNK OF A VERY THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 TINDERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING THAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOALS SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE GIRL SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FOAL DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOLE AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDERLID
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS AND NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001 THE YOUNG KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
3538-163624-0003 SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DUSK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE WATER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WAS AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND GOT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE STRING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REGAN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKEN
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BREAD AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGURD SAYS THAT SWORD WOULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW A TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGURD SAYS I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO GRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FAFFNER AND THEN STAFFIER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFNEY'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNEY ON A STEAK AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER AND HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE RINHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND WRITE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN SHE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE COME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 LYN BRANHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUNDRED WERE BATHING BRUNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRON'S SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG TILL I AM DEAD
367-130732-0000 LOBSTERS ARE LOBSTERS
367-130732-0001 WHEN IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS THE CRAYFISH
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO TO THE PRIMARY OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOUR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED TO THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN
367-130732-0004 A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN ALL COULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD WIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER ELLE NIEBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DOMONICO

367-130732-0012 I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ON THE COAST IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUSLY AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
367-130732-0013 GOBY'S PASS WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAD NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBIES OF BEFORE THE FIRE BUT ITS PRESTIGE DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
367-130732-0015 GOBI'S CRAB STEW
367-130732-0016 TAKE THE MEATS OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT ALL THE FAT FROM THE SHELL

367-130732-0022 SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE HOP BROW HAS BEEN MAKING A SPECIALTY OF THEM
367-130732-0023 ALL THE BETTER CLASS RESTAURANTS HOWEVER WILL SERVE HIM IF YOU ORDER THEM

367-293981-0011 TO BE BRIEF HE TOOK THE MATERIALS OF WHICH HE MADE A COMPOUND MIXING THEM ALL AND BOILING THEM A GOOD WHILE BEFORE IT SEEMED TO HIM THEY HAD COME TO PERFECTION
367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE PILLSKIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED IT DOWN AND DRAINED OF VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER
367-293981-0014 IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT RETURNED SANCHO WOE BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KINDRED WHY DID YOU LET ME TASTE
367-293981-0015 SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THE KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU BY THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOU SATISFACTION AND REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRE
367-293981-0016 THEN IT IS AN INN SAID DON QUIXOTE
367-293981-0017 AN A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE SAID THE INNKEEPER
367-293981-0018 THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLANKETED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW ADVENTURER WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS SQUIRE WHO UTTERED THEM
367-293981-0019 SHE SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
367-293981-0020 SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE A BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
3764-168670-0000 THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF AN ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
3764-168670-0001 AUGUST HAD WAKED UP
3764-168670-0002 JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED HER NEAR A FIRE
3764-168670-0003 YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE I WILL COME TO FETCH YOU
3764-168670-0004 EVERYTHING WAS ARRANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
3764-168670-0005 I HAVE PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE PUT OUT
3764-168670-0006 THAT'S WHERE THIS DIFFICULTY LIES
3764-168670-0007 IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THE CHILD YOU WOULD CARRY HER OUT
3764-168670-0008 AND SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE I ASK FOR THAT
3764-168670-0009 AND FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN VALJEAN
3764-168670-0010 YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNOR WILL NOTICE IT
3764-168670-0011 JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RAVENING
3764-168670-0012 FAUCHELEVENT WENT IN
3764-168670-0013 IT IS TO MORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECT YOU
3764-168670-0014 THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR A SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THAT COMMUNITY
3764-168670-0015 THEN THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
3764-168670-0016 THAT THE PRIORESS AND THE VOCAL MASTERS INTENDED TO FULFIL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
3764-168670-0017 THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THE CELL RAISE THE STONE OF THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
3764-168670-0018 AND THEN THIS THERE WAS ANOTHER THE EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0019 WHAT IS AN EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0020 I ASKED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
3764-168670-0021 WHATT COFFIN WHAT ADMINISTRATION
3764-168670-0022 FAUCHELEVENT WHO IS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER HIS CHAIR YOU
3764-168670-0023 YOU KNOW FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IS
3764-168670-0024 AND I HAVE AND FATHER MADELEINE IS BURIED R
3764-168670-0025 YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN FATHERS MADELEINE
3764-168670-0026 IT OFFERS THE MEANS GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
3764-168670-0027 HOW LONG IS THE CONVENT SIX FEET
3764-168670-0028 IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH WHERE CHURCH
3764-168670-0029 THE CHURCH IN THE STREET THO THE CHURCH WHICH ANYONE CAN ENTER
3764-168670-0030 HAVE YOU THE KEYS TO THE TWO DOORS
3764-168670-0031 NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO A DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKERS MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET THE COTTON
3764-168670-0033 WHO NAILS UP THE COFFIN I DID
3764-168670-0034 HE SPREADS THE PAW OVER IT
3764-168670-0035 NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR COULD ENTER THE DEAD ROOM THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
3764-168670-0036 COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THAT ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN EVERYTHING IS ASLEEP
3764-168670-0037 ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
3764-168670-0038 I SHALL BE ANGRY I WILL BRING YOU SOMETHING
3764-168670-0039 YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP IN THIS COFFIN AT TWO O'CLOCK
3764-168670-0040 FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS FINGER JOINTS AND THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
3764-168670-0041 BOH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS IN A PLANK
3764-168670-0042 JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS THAN THESE
3764-168670-0043 EVERY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
3764-168670-0044 WHY DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A CURE
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMISE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE ROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK ON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0047 A MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH AND SNEEZE
3764-168670-0048 WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO HIS CAT DO COME IN
3764-168670-0049 THE OVERPRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER FROM THE AUDACIOUS
3764-168670-0050 BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIM HE GRUMBLED
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THAT COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
3764-168670-0052 AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0053 I SHALL FOLLOW THIS IS MY BUSINESS
3764-168670-0054 THE HORSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKERS MEN KNOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0055 THE PRIEST SAYS THEIR PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WOULD EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER
3764-168670-0057 THAT IS SETTLED MISTER FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL GO WELL
3764-168671-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAIN PUT OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEARS
3764-168671-0001 THIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING EYES
3764-168671-0002 A MORNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST ON HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
3764-168671-0003 BESIDE IT CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABOURER WHO LIMPED ALONG
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING IN SUMMER AND AT NIGHT AND WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY UPON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES
3764-168671-0006 DAMPINESS WAS INVADING IT THE FLOWERS WERE DESERTING IT
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VOJERA IT HINTED AT POVERTY PER LA CHAISE IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHEIS IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0009 THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN INTO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENCE IN OUR SIGHT
3764-168671-0010 IT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE HER DUTY
3764-168671-0011 THE NUNS HAD COMMITTED NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
3764-168671-0012 IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY OR INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0013 MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE AND BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES
3764-168671-0014 THE PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPAL
3764-168671-0015 FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED DOWN BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0016 JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE COMFORTABLE TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0017 WHAT SEEMED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESTIAN
3764-168671-0019 HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM ADVANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
3764-168671-0020 THE PERMISSION TO INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF NEIGHBOURING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0022 MY MAN REPLIED THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0023 THE GRAVE DIGGERS YES
3764-168671-0024 YOU I'
3764-168671-0025 FATHER MESTIEN IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
3764-168671-0026 FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS AND A GRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE
3764-168671-0027 IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIGGERS DO DIE SOMETIMES
3764-168671-0028 YOU HAD HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STAMMER
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER BASTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LANOIR IS HERE'S A JUG OF RED WINE
3764-168671-0031 AND YOU ARE A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
3764-168671-0032 ARE YOU NOT COMRADE WE WILL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
3764-168671-0033 THE MAN SAID
3764-168671-0034 WE LIMPED MORE OUT OF ANXIETY THAN FROM INFIRMITY
3764-168671-0035 THE GRAVE DIGGER WALKED UPON IN FRONT OF HIM
3764-168671-0036 FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED CREVELLER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE WALKER HE MUTTERED
3764-168671-0038 BUT SIR FATHER MASTIAN IS DEAD
3764-168671-0039 THE MAN REPLIED CLEARLY
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTEBOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MESTRINE'S TURN FATHER MESTHIERNE DIED
3764-168671-0041 STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT HE IS MADE
3764-168671-0042 YOU ARE A PEASANT I I AM A PARISIAN
3764-168671-0043 FAUCHELEVENT SAID I AM LOST
3764-168671-0044 THERE WAS ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUN'S CORNER
3764-168671-0045 AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TRYING A PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEEL AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE CRETINNIUM TOWN HALL
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSEES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0049 SO YOU ARE NOT A GRAVE DIGGER NOW
3764-168671-0050 RETURNED FAUCHELEVEN CLUTCHING AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS
3764-168671-0051 HERE A REMARK APPEARS NECESSARY
3764-168671-0052 FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON THAT POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053 THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH THE SUPERIOR SMILE
3764-168671-0054 ONE MUST MEET
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING I WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASKED FOR SOMETHING WHAT
3997-180294-0002 WELL DO IT FOR ME I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR RED
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS I DO
3997-180294-0005 THEN GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECOLLECT ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST CORDIAL OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MEN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF A MYSTERY VEIL
3997-180294-0010 WITH HIM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
3997-180294-0011 THEY MOVED BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY THE PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0013 THEY KNOW NOT WHAT TO GIVE
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABORERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVE IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0015 THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LIVE SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE HAS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAISONS
3997-180294-0018 WHEN I CAME HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAIETY
3997-180294-0019 THIS WOMAN BECOMES THE MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 HOW WHAT
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED TO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT ON THE VAUDEVILLE
3997-180294-0023 COME DURING THE THIRD HAND TRACT
3997-180294-0024 THE BOXES FLEW ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY IN THE STAGE BOX
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF A THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0027 DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I WOULD BE
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF A BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 YOU CAN GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0030 OR AT HOME
3997-180294-0031 YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ANSWER
3997-180294-0032 BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING ME
3997-180294-0033 NONE THE LESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THAT EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0000 I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM SEEING PARIS
3997-180297-0001 YOU IS IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MAY HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE
3997-180297-0003 DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT HER ATTENTIVELY
3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR PRINCE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME BACK AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE SLIGHTEST HARM
3997-180297-0007 IS THAT REASON THE ONLY REASON
3997-180297-0008 IF THERE WAS ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
3997-180297-0009 AND HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
3997-180297-0010 I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I COULD GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0011 OH GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
3997-180297-0012 I EXCLAIMED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MEN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
3997-180297-0014 SURELY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRES AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND RUINING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017 WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEM AND LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER DO THEY GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH WAS NOT LUCRATIVE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME AND COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER DETECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0021 I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE THAT HE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVED AND USED WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON A SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0024 MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
3997-180297-0025 MARGUERITE DREW HER LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID
3997-180297-0026 HERE IT IS I HAD BROUGHT IT BACK
3997-180297-0027 I TORE A LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME
3997-180297-0028 LOOK HERE PRUDENCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS SAID MARGUERITE
3997-180297-0029 HE WANTS YOU TO FORGIVE
3997-180297-0030 ONE HAS TO AND HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT THEN
3997-180297-0031 I EMBRACED MARGUERITE WHILE SHE WAS ALMOST STIFLED
3997-182399-0000 OLD MISTER BAZZARD GRINNED
3997-182399-0001 THIS SOUNDED LIKE ANY STORY
3997-182399-0002 HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK HEADED COUSIN OF OLD MISSUS BUZZARD VERY CURIOUS INDEED
3997-182399-0003 ANYWAY THEY WOULD FIND OUT

4198-12281-0005 LORD GOD DAMN ME HE POTUM
4198-12281-0006 LET HIM BE CARRIED TO THE PRISON FOR TROUBLING THE DIVINE SERVICE
4198-12281-0007 WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS ARE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN THE ADVENT AND ALL THE WINTER
4198-12281-0008 HARK YOU MY MASTERS YOU THAT LOVE THE WINE COPSE'S BODY FOLLOW ME FOR SAINT ANTHONY BURN ME AS FREELY AS A FAGGOT THEY GET LEAVE TO TASTE ONE DROP OF THE LIQUOR THAT WILL NOT NOW COME AND FIGHT FOR RELIEF OF THE VINE
4198-12281-0009 TO OTHERS AGAIN HE UNJOINTED THE SPINDELS OR KNUCKLES OF THE NECK DISFIGURED THEIR CHAPS GHASHED THEIR FACES MADE THEIR CHEEKS HANG FLAPPING ON THEIR CHIN AND SO SWINGED AND BELAMMED THEM THAT THEY FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM LIKE HAY BEFORE HIM
4198-12281-0010 TO SOME WITH THEIR SMART SOUS ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDDRIFT WAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOME PUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
4198-12281-0011 BEFORE THAT IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER ONE SAW
4198-12281-0012 O THE HOLY LADY NITTICH SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTUS O OUR LADY OF SUCCOURS SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP
4198-12281-0013 SOME DIED WITHOUT SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE WITHOUT DYING SOME DIED IN SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE IN WRITING
4198-12281-0014 CAN YOU TELL WITH WHAT INSTRUMENTS I DID IT
4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEANWHILE FRIAR JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHAR BY THE ADHERENCE OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH CIVIL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SHARDURUS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
4198-61336-0003 TIGLATH PALLISER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE EURENTIAN ARMY IN KOUMAC
4198-61336-0004 A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF ITS ROMANTIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING CARDORUS WHO LEAPED FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST EURUTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0007 THE SIFTI MATTI ILIU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHAWDORUS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TIGLATH BELIEZER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THAT WESTERN LAND WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0010 ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATTA ILIU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE HEBREWES CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA
4198-61336-0012 ITS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEAR OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 JEHOS THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARD HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHELIAM
4198-61336-0015 THAT USURPER HELD SWAY AT SUMERIA FOR ONLY A MONTH
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MANUHEIM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0017 TEGLATH PALLIZER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTHEAST
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOT PUT IN THE SWARD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS JURATU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLATH POLIZER RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0021 MENEHEIM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PECAHIAH
4198-61336-0022 JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT HER INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0023 HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR ITS IDOLATRIES AND CALLED
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YE ME AND YE SHALL LIVE HAD YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL
4198-61336-0025 THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES MUST PERISH
4198-61336-0026 ISRAEL WAS ALSO DEALT
4198-61336-0027 HE SWEPT FROM ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0028 THE PHILISTINES AND ARABIANS OF THE DESERT WAS ALSO SUBDUED
4198-61336-0029 WE INVADED BABYLONIA
4198-61336-0030 UGENZER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITOL SCIPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0000 AS I FELT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAR I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAVE LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME ERROR
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GAVE ME THE LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BENNELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR IF HE GOES TO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0005 I ASK NO FARTHER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO BETTER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FIGURE TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0008 I BEGGED HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM I HAD EVER TAKEN
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GEORGIO DU CORTONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0010 GIORGIO CAME FOR THEM HIS HEAD
4294-14317-0011 I WISH TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUC ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDINE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LANDI WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGELLIO
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THE NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTOR'S CRAFT
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PIECE I BADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-14317-0016 AMONGST ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE NEW SCULPTOR
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEIS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS PLEASANT RESOLVE IN HEART I REACHED MY HOME
4294-32859-0000 WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DROPPED HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE IS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDLIN AND RHETCH'S PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND ILL TELL YOU THE STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT BABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 AND HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE ONE WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BROTHERS
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU OUR SWORD HE QUOTH
4294-35475-0003 IN YOUTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN'S SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET UP JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRIID HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SPEAK HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST REND ME TO PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH PEARLY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER IT IS THE OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US FROM THE OGRES MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEELS AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER ON THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS VICTIM
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEY
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWED TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THESE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THAT OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT THE FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT'S TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVERRIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTAWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR AND INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-35475-0024 AMONGST THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT ETHEL RIED HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE ISOUT
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED HIS FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BATLIGHT SOULS
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE RECEIVED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF NIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM HIS FATHER
4294-9934-0008 ITS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS YEARS OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON ELBOWED IN ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARCUS
4294-9934-0012 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US SAID COURFEYRAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT ARE YE GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0014 SILVER COLD HERE IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 THAT SHALL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 NO IT'S NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DID YOU KNOW GERMAN NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PAID WORK FOR ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHESDEALER WAS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO A WATCHMAKER'S
4294-9934-0022 HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FIFTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0023 HILLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD PRESENTED THIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE SEVEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR AN HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN THE SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT SHE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE FATHER
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE BEGAN TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRESSED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAYS THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THIS QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SMILE
4350-10919-0006 THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALMUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN THE PRESENCE OF INDICATION OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
4350-10919-0009 YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED A CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKE BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED WHY IT IS
4350-10919-0012 OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT AT TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABROAD ASK THE FAMILY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION FOR LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0015 THIS FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLED UP REMINISCENCES
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT SHE ADDED
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET ME GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 AH TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THE FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS CAME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 THEN THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 SHE ANSWERED HIM ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBSTACLE IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOUVE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFF
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I AM FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATER WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTIONS SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO REPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND MAGGIE PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THAT EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-9170-0001 THIS IS EVIDENTLY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WOULD VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONCLUSION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY A MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005 THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS POSITIVE VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO THE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A GENERAL WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THE ARMY THAN IN ANY THING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT COULD BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD A SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THIS SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS WORSE THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THAT STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY THE STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO EXTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0017 BUT JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEARED ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DID SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSOR OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO WERE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022 AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THE TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF THIRTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THEIR RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICER TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE FAMILY
4350-9170-0028 BUT IT IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY TO ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE WAS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER TO NEIGHBOURING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE PARTY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICES SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED ON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN NATIONAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF A SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY ARE MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBOURS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOUR WHICH THE ARMY USED TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF THE LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 THE GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THE SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT I MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045 I HAVE EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT TO THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBERS THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER KNOWN
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THAT STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TOO IS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THAT GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NUMBERS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH THE ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF A STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBOURS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN COULD FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFECT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES IN BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAY YOU KNEW SOMETHING
4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CARAC AND SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002 KNOW WHO NEEDS THE JOB AND THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS
4852-28311-0003 O K HE SAYS
4852-28311-0004 BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT AT EM STREET
4852-28311-0006 WELL HE DEMANDED I DID
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED BENEATH HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 THINK YOU REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREET WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT SMITH WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BITCH AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED ON HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE CARPET
4852-28311-0013 OF SHUCKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER BICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN IN TWO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK ON THE BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON TO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND BLUE CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLY AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL SHE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID A LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTRE THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN A MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0025 WHERE THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARHORN WOKE HIM FROM THE DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOWS AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE TILL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE A LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0003 HEAVY HANDED HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0004 MISSUS WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLES OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR AND WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0007 KIT BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0008 CHRIS SWALLOWED AND THE VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
4852-28312-0009 YES SIR
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A GIRL WHO NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0011 HES A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE
4852-28312-0012 JAMIE HARRIS'S NAME IS HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE LIFE WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL OF THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEHIND
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE JUST GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALTUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE THAPHIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018 THE HALL SEEMED OVERLY STILL
4852-28312-0019 THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED AROUND
4852-28312-0020 THE WIDE WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHERE IS THE WAY
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKETACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023 THE WAREHOUSE WAS STILL THERE
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN ANY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPS LIT STREETS
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD FOR HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
4852-28312-0027 THE COURTYARD WAS SPECIALLY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING THE SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS LANDED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0029 A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED A HALT BESIDE THE FLANGED COURTYARD
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLING OFF TO THE STABLE
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOWS HAS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28319-0000 AND LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
4852-28319-0001 HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOETHLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28319-0002 CHRIS THEREUPON THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BULL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHOULD ALLIE DO FIRST
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY THEN THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSE I CHANGED AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK
4852-28319-0007 MISTER WAGER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0008 THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER GRIGGER SAID START AT ONCE
4852-28319-0009 THE CONVERSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH HER FINAL WORDS
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT LESS HIGH
4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR FOOT ONE THE RETURN
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURES SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE AT CURVED UP POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0014 THEN ALL AT ONCE A IDEA CAME TO CHRIS
4852-28319-0015 IF HE WERE TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED STONE FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0017 BUT WHAT DID ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
4852-28319-0018 SMITH GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY IT RESUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF A CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON RAYING BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM
4852-28319-0021 DEATH CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY
4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED IN THE PROPER TIME
4852-28319-0023 MISTER WALKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKE AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCION FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO GIRL
4852-28319-0025 IT WAS AS IF THEIR STIFFNESS MELTED
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES THE WOODEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND THE FACE
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES OPENED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED LET THE BOUQUET FALL
4852-28330-0000 WE WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THAT DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY OLIVER JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AN I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
4852-28330-0004 THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TIHITI
4852-28330-0005 WE HAVE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON THERE
4852-28330-0006 CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0007 CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY CLEAN AND PENETRATING
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINNEL WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE ROSE WITH EARNESTNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING ON HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY WHAT I DO
4852-28330-0012 MY SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY
4852-28330-0013 HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN AN REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM
4852-28330-0014 WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU
4852-28330-0015 A SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY YOU SIR
4852-28330-0017 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED WITH ITS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0018 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE FOOT WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0019 CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME HE UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0020 WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THIS TIME SIR CHRIS OUGHT TO ASK
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT
4852-28330-0022 I SHALL SEE THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER BOOKER AND CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTIONABLY ACCOUNTED FOR
4852-28330-0025 THEIR CONVERSATION HAS TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
533-1066-0000 AND CHURCHYARDS YAWN
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE WOULD BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
533-1066-0002 I'M SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
533-1066-0003 FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL IN THEIR LODGE
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0005 MISS INNIS HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TO NIGHT
533-1066-0006 I HAVE DONE I SAID HAPPILY
533-1066-0007 I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU CAN GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL
533-1066-0008 THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF COULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT
533-1066-0009 SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN HE SAID
533-1066-0010 PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
533-1066-0011 LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST AND I WENT UPSTAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
533-1066-0012 THEY WERE TALKING COFICENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
533-1066-0013 THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTER TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0014 SHE ASKED NO QUESTIONS
533-1066-0015 ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM MISTER STUART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE
533-1066-0016 I' HARDLY KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED
533-1066-0017 THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHEN WE CAME TO A HALT
533-1066-0018 I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNY SIDE SEEMED A CHEERFUL SPOT
533-1066-0019 IN SPITE OF MYSELF I TOOK MY BREATH IN SHARPLY
533-1066-0020 HE WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES
533-1066-0021 A DOCTOR KEPT A KEEN LOOKOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED
533-1066-0022 THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF IMPLICITY
533-1066-0023 THE DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING THEM UP
533-1066-0024 I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT HERE AND LOOKED DOWN
533-131556-0000 BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS WHICH MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY GO
533-131556-0001 FOR NONE COULD ENDURE ME AS HE HATH DONE OH
533-131556-0002 THIS WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
533-131556-0004 I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD SO MINUTELY
533-131556-0005 THEY HAD AWAKENED THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK
533-131556-0006 I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTERS AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT
533-131556-0007 UPON PERUSING THIS SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIPS
533-131556-0008 YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND SHELL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT
533-131556-0009 WE'LL OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE

533-131556-0012 I ENJOY A MOONLAND RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESORTS
533-131556-0013 SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER CHEST AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
533-131556-0014 I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING TO SAY
533-131556-0015 YES YET
533-131556-0016 SUPPOSE THEY DO
533-131556-0017 SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW IT
533-131556-0018 I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT WAS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
533-131556-0019 IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL RATHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR ADEMPTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
533-131556-0020 I SHALL NEVER TELL HIM

533-131556-0022 AND MILICENT WILL YOU TAKE HER
533-131556-0023 I WOULD NOT FOR MUCH THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF THE RELATION

533-131562-0002 THE KEY OF MY VESTK IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
533-131562-0003 NOW THEN SNEERED HE YOU MUST HAVE A CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY
533-131562-0004 AND PUTTING THE KEYS INTO HIS POCKET HE WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
533-131562-0005 THAT AN ALL REPLIED THE MASTER AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
533-131562-0006 MISSUS HUNTINGDON THEN WENT UP STAIRS
533-131562-0007 MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE'S VERY DEAD FOR SPITE

533-131562-0013 NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMED BUT IT'S BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
533-131562-0014 HERE BENSON ENTERED THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENTLY TRIUMPHING AT MY DESPAIR
533-131562-0015 I KNOW IT DAY AFTER DAY SUCH FEELINGS WILL RETURN UPON ME
533-131562-0016 I TRY TO LOOK TO HIM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT IT WOULD CLEAVE TO THE DUST
533-131564-0000 VAGUE HOPE I FEAR

533-131564-0018 THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNEXION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMSBY AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENUOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON THE OTHER MAN'S SHOULDERS

533-131564-0027 AFTER THIS THEY WILL REPAIR TO THEIR COUNTRY HOME
5442-32873-0000 CAPTAIN LAKE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE THE LONDON DANDIE NOW
5442-32873-0001 THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND A WILD LURE IN THIS YELLOW EYES RACHEL SAT DOWN
5442-32873-0002 A SLAVE ONLY TOOK A SLAVE
5442-32873-0003 OH FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL IS THE DREAM
5442-32873-0004 OH FRIGHTFUL TRIFLE
5442-32873-0005 STANLEY STANLEY IT WOULD BE MERCY TO KILL ME SHE BROKE DOWN AGAIN
5442-32873-0006 BRIGHT AND NATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH HIS BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF A SAGE HER PILLOW SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
5442-32873-0007 WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TORTOT BOTTLE OF EAU COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
5442-32873-0008 THERE WAS NOTHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE SHARP FEATURE DURING THE PROCESS
5442-32873-0009 THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY INTO HER ROOM
5442-32873-0010 AS SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS
5442-32873-0011 RACHAEL LEAK ANGEL LAKE WHAT ARE YOU NOW
5442-32873-0012 I'LL STAY HERE IT IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-32873-0013 HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGERTT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0014 LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKINS'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WILDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOLL CART FOR MIKE BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOG CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
5442-32873-0015 BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LINE WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARDS THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGHAM
5442-32873-0016 HERE WERE THE FLOW OF SOULS AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELLED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
5442-32873-0017 LOSE NO TIME AN I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A CRUMB
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STUCK HOME HIS GREASY WIDE AWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOG CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSES HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD DAY TAMAR
5442-41168-0000 THE COUNT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT UP TO TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY CORPSE SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR OTTO AND BALLOT
5442-41168-0004 WE SHED OUR BLOOD FROM OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NOT CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE IS NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 VOTES PLEASE MISSUS
5442-41168-0007 HE EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOVE FLEROS SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLOROFF'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS OF WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE BAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED A SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JURED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN LAUGHED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0014 SODYY IVANOVITCH FROWNED
5442-41168-0015 IT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN DECISION HE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND INTO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0017 A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSIONS NINETY EIGHT AGAINST
5442-41168-0018 RANG OUT THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
5442-41168-0019 AND THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO KNOTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX
5442-41168-0020 AND THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERED
5442-41168-0021 IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THAT NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE YOU
5442-41168-0024 BUT THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
5442-41168-0025 WE WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTION
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNETKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT FLOOV TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMEN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZKSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE ROOFS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID AROUND HIM
5442-41169-0002 WHO'S SUCH A BLACKGUARD
5442-41169-0003 I HAVE TOLD HER SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
5442-41169-0004 THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY FAIR CHAMPAGNE
5442-41169-0006 LAST YEAR AT OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NICOLAY IVANOVITCH'S
5442-41169-0007 OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION SO IT MUST BE
5442-41169-0008 WHY WHAT IS THEY TO UNDERSTAND
5442-41169-0009 THERE HAS NO MEANING IN IT AT ALL
5442-41169-0010 THAT TOO ONE MUST KEEP UP CONNECTIONS
5442-41169-0011 THAT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF A SORT
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH IT'S ONE'S OWN INTERESTS
5442-41169-0013 THEY ARE PROPRIETORS OF A SOT BUT WE ARE THE LANDOWNERS
5442-41169-0014 THEN IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE A TREE THAT'S STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THAT VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND HOW IS YOUR MAN DOING
5442-41169-0017 BUT ONE'S WORK IS THROWN IN TO NOTHING
5442-41169-0018 OH WELL ONE DOES AND WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0019 AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS AT THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'D BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES IT
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASIEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'LL CUT DOWN THE LIME TREE
5442-41169-0023 HERE WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BACH
5442-41169-0024 YOU'RE MARRIED I HAVE HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER
5442-41169-0025 YES ITS RATHER STRANGE HE WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THE LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WIDE MOUSTACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OURS FOR TIMBER
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT WHICH HAD STRUCK HIM
5442-41169-0029 THERE'S A CLASS'S INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES SOME GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A RETURN AT A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATHS PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HERONN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANER
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD APPEAR HOWEVER AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPORTUNITY
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS BUT HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED HEART TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTHILUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION THOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HIS ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMANN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATIUS AND THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENOL
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SCIENCE AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELT CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THAT SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICHKO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENAL'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSIMOCHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SON THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HARMON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES IN TIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISED ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMYTAS THE LIEGE CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLUS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LOG PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSANAU IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FROM THAT FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAYS THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERONN
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENOL HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
5484-24317-0025 THE OLD LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HERMAND LISTENED TO THE AIR IN SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENO ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRATEZ HERMANN'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMEANOUR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 BUT WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MAN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMAND'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU HAD STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNAS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAN VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0000 NOT THE SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMAND PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS SHE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURES HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET THE SUDDEN END AS A BOOM FROM THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FAITH
5484-24318-0007 IF HE PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMANN WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AN ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTILLUS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THIS MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24318-0010 YET IT WAS NOT ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST EASE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE VISITORS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERRID IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHOULD CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS AND PHILIPPA SILENCED HER WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF A MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALASTRA THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND I LOVED YOU ALWAYS
5484-24318-0021 DAPHNE CRIED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMANN WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHOULD NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORKER MYRTUS
5484-24318-0024 WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL INDEED AWAITS YOU
5484-24318-0025 AND A FOOL BLINDED ALSO IN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRING THAT BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL AND PALLIATE NOTHING
5484-24318-0027 SORAKAIUS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF ON A WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMINETZ THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT DEPART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THRUPPED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND SHE WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS JUST
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERMON
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATULUS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HERIMONN
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE A CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOR TO MYRTELUS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THE NOBLE FEASTEL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMPS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THE GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST
5764-299665-0001 WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF OR MYSELF
5764-299665-0002 WHETHER ANY PRAYER IS EVER ANSWERED
5764-299665-0003 WHY DID HE CREATE A INTELLECTUAL INFERIOR
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE A DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0005 ARE THE LAWYERS UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0006 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS WHICH HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOWED FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0008 IS THAT GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0009 DID THIS GOD HOLD THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0010 DID HE ILLA TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0011 COULD WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DIVVORE HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE FEEDS ON A LIFE
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NERVE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF THE MICROBE
5764-299665-0015 FEAR BUILDS THE ALTARS AND OFFERS THE SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0016 FEAR ERECTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF THE MAN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0017 LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THO HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0018 CAN I SAY THAT HE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
5764-299665-0019 CAN WE SAY THAT THIS MERCY ENDURED FOR EVER
5764-299665-0020 DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANO HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0021 WAS THAT GOODNESS WAS THERE WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0022 OUGHT A SUPERIOR RACE TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THE INFERIOR
5764-299665-0023 MOST WOMEN CLING TO THE SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0024 IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY MANAGE ANOTHER
5764-299665-0025 IS THIS POWER
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES INTO EXPERIENCE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COME UP TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0028 HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND KNOWS THAT IT WAS THE WRONG ROAD
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPED IT WITH HIS DIMPLING HAND
5764-299665-0030 THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAD TAUGHT THIS CHILD A LESSON
5764-299665-0031 IT HAS A RESULT
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS EXOTIC
5764-299665-0033 WE LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATION
5764-299665-0034 I ARE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
5764-299665-0035 THESE ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MORAL
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD FRIENDS
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAD SAID CONSCIENCE WAS BORN OF LOVE
5764-299665-0038 AS THE PEOPLE ADVANCE THE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0039 MY IMAGINATION IS CULTIVATED
5764-299665-0040 A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF OTHER
5764-299665-0041 THE SENSE OF BEAUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
5764-299665-0042 THE MAN JUDGES HIMSELF
5764-299665-0043 IN ALL THIS THERE'S NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0044 WHO HAS DECEIVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HES CHRISTIANITY DUN GOUD
5764-299665-0046 WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL WERE MAN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN MORE WITHOUT RELIGION
5764-299665-0049 COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0050 WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DO FOR US
5764-299665-0051 THEY HATED FAILURE
5764-299665-0052 THEY MUFFLED ALL THEIR BELLS OF GLADNESS
5764-299665-0053 THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED COURSE
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WICKED
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE OF HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THERE
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
5764-299665-0058 HAS THIS BIBLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED BUT IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES HAS FAILED
5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCES OF INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
5764-299665-0061 RELIGION HATH NEVER MADE MEN FREE
5764-299665-0062 IT HAS NEVER MADE ONE MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
5764-299665-0063 ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEARER VIRTUOUS AND NEARER HONEST THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0064 CAN WE CURE DISEASE BY A SUPPLICATION
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR ERROR AS ALMS
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER SHALL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT ITS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE GAINED THE STONES
5764-299665-0068 THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A BASEMENTS
5764-299665-0069 IF WE BUILD WE SHALL BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM
5764-299665-0070 I HAD A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNERSTONES
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST WORD IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNERSTONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM THE END TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR COULD BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DIVINE BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0075 I SAYS WHAT I THINK
5764-299665-0076 EVERY EVENT HIS PARENTS
5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HATH NOT HAPPENED COULD NOT
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHAINED RICE AND THEIR CAMP BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
5764-299665-0079 YOU NOW KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0080 WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE PATH THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELED
5764-299665-0082 WE KNEW THE FOOTSTEPS OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORD
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE THE REPORTERS FAILED
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND UPON THE LAW ON LUCK AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE BY FRAUDS AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0087 FAILURE SEEMS TO BE A TRADEMARK OF NATURE WHY
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PRODUCED WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTIONS AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
5764-299665-0089 MUST THE WORLD FOREVER REMAINED THE VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE A BURDEN AND CARES WHY
5764-299665-0091 PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEFINITE
5764-299665-0092 LOVE CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
5764-299665-0093 THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY TALK FOR EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0094 THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION
5764-299665-0095 THAT FREES WOMEN
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME WILL BE KINDLESS
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FAULTS AND BARRIERS OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE
6070-63485-0000 THERE DONE FATHER SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOW KEY TO THE CHOUETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE

6070-63485-0017 HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS OF HIS SELF STYLED FAN PAINTER

6070-86744-0006 SO BE IT THEN REPLIED THE COUNT AND EXTENDING HIS HAND TOWARDS THE CALENDAR SUSPENDED NEAR THE CHIMNEYPIECE HE SAID TO DAY IS THE TWENTY FIRST OF FEBRUARY AND DRAWING OUT HIS WATCH ADDED IT IS EXACTLY HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK NOW PROMISE ME TO REMEMBER THIS AND EXPECT ME THE TWENTY FIRST OF MAY AT THE SAME HOUR IN THE FORENOON
6070-86744-0007 I RESIDE IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE BUT OCCUPY A PAVILION AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF A COURTYARD AND TILE IS SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN BUILDING
6070-86744-0008 NOW THEN SAID THE COUNT RETURNING HIS TABLETS TO HIS POCKETS MAKE YOURSELF PERFECTLY EASY THE HAND OF YOUR TIME PIECE WILL NOT BE MORE ACCURATE IN MARKING THE TIME THAN MYSELF
6070-86744-0009 IT DEPENDS WHEN DO YOU LEAVE
6070-86744-0010 FOR FRANCE NO FOR VENICE I SHOULD REMAIN IN ITALY FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO
6070-86744-0011 THEN WE SHALL NOT MEET IN PARADISE
6070-86744-0012 I FEAR I SHALL NOT HAVE THIS HONOUR
6070-86744-0013 BUT SINCE WE MUST PART SAID THE COUNT HOLDING OUT A HAND TO EACH OF THE YOUNG MEN ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU BOTH A SAFE AND PLEASANT JOURNEY
6070-86744-0014 WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED ALBERT OF FRANCES WHEN THEY HAD RETURNED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS YOU SEEM MORE THAN COMMONLY THOUGHTFUL
6070-86744-0015 I WILL CONFESS TO YOU ALBERT REPLIED FRANZ THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLEDS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0016 DID YOU EVER KNOW HIM PREVIOUSLY TO COMING HITHER
6070-86744-0017 UPON MY HONOUR BUT LISTEN TO ME
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY ON A ALMOST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAM AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YACHT SEEN IN THE DISTANT HORIZON DRIVING UNDER FULL SAIL TOWARD PORTO VECCHIO
6070-86744-0019 AND HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86744-0020 BUT SAID CHARLES THE CORSICAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSEL
6070-86744-0021 WHY SURELY THE THING SEEMS TO ME SIMPLE ENOUGH
6070-86744-0022 TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DOES HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT ARE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINGTURED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY
6070-86744-0023 CERTAINLY THESE WERE QUESTIONS THAT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANSWERED
6070-86744-0024 MY DEAR FRANTZ REPLIED ALBERT WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FELT THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO DELIVER HIM
6070-86744-0025 WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT WAS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY IS HE A NATIVE
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESS HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SENOR VAMPA WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASE AND UNCONCERN I DO NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ROBERT'S SIDE
6070-86744-0028 WELL SAID FANNY WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT FOR YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND MY POWERS OF REFUTATION
6070-86744-0029 NOW MY DEAR FRANZ LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
6070-86745-0000 THEN SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GAIT SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND COURT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS IN WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0002 AT A QUARTER TO TEN A VALET ENTERED HE COMPOSED WITH THE LITTLE GROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASSEUR ALSO
6070-86745-0003 WAIT THEN DURING THIS DAY TELL ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISHED
6070-86745-0004 VERY WELL IN HALF PAST TEN
6070-86745-0005 IS THE COUNTESS UP
6070-86745-0006 THIS VALET LEFT THE ROOM
6070-86745-0007 GOOD MORNING LUCIEN GOOD MORNING SAID HERBERT YOUR PUNCTUALITY REALLY ALARMS ME
6070-86745-0008 YOU WHOM I EXPECTED LAST YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN AND THE TIME FIXED WAS HALF PAST
6070-86745-0009 NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW DO NOT CONFOUND MY PLANS
6070-86745-0010 YES HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGE IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTH
6070-86745-0011 IT IS FOR THAT REASON YOU SEE ME SO EARLIER
6070-86745-0012 I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO HAVE A RIDE OF AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 PESTS I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM YOU WOULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE
6070-86745-0014 BECAUSE THAT DOES NOT CONCERN THE HOME BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
6070-86745-0015 NOW WHAT ABOUT THE PAPERS
6070-86745-0016 IN THAT ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAID THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE
6070-86745-0018 COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIO
6070-86745-0019 WITH YOUR TALENTS SHE WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP A VOLUME FROM THE TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
6128-63240-0001 THAT HAS AN UNFLATERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
6128-63240-0002 SHE IS WILLING TO RISK
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM A VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORKADAY ASPECT
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING THE SMALL RED STONE
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN UPON A BRONZE MEDAL
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOOLDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF A COTTON FIELD
6128-63240-0009 AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT GRAVELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPERS AND ROARING RADICALS
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT NO MURDER
6128-63240-0012 HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LOONER WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6128-63240-0013 SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE BUT IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LATTER
6128-63240-0014 HAVE YOU IN EUROPE
6128-63240-0015 NO IT HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES IT I WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LEAH
6128-63240-0018 ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS YOU WERE
6128-63240-0019 AND MISSUS LEA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0020 I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR
6128-63240-0021 BECAUSE OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BUSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0022 THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT TO ANY FORMS
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LANEY'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND DIM SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO THE THEATRE PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LANEY'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSLOW THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BOEOTTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDERNESS HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNU'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002 RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHICH MADE HER TRAGIC
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANYONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THE HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN REAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH A OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0009 OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYBODY BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO MAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HIS LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0012 HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTING
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE HAZER RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF HATH THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THIS VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE LADIES AT BEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT THE BALLOT
6128-63244-0002 SHE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER ENORMOUS SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
6128-63244-0004 OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE FOR A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0005 ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FAZENDER WHO LIVED AT RUXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINGERS SUPPOSED AND THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0007 SHE WISHED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE
6128-63244-0008 THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT HE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0009 CHARLIE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WIDE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT I CARED MUCH THE MOST
6128-63244-0010 OLIVE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MISSUS BARRINGER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF A QUESTION
6128-63244-0011 IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE THAT SHRINKING
6128-63244-0012 OUR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE INTELLIGENCE
6128-63244-0013 RAISE THIS STANDARD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME YOUR THOUSAND NAMES
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CURRANTS MISSUS FERVENDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0015 SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSION OF HIS RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0016 I WON TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREATEST REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THEIR SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
6128-63244-0018 THE UNHAPPINESS OF ENGLAND
6128-63244-0019 THEY WERE HIS SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THE DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT AND JUST REVOLUTION IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTAL BLOOD STAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0021 THERE WOULD BE THE NAMES OF WOMEN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE MISTS OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY AS SUCCESS
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BIRD'S EYE OPENED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEM ALREADY A MARTYR
6128-63244-0024 OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG UNREWARDED WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OR AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MUCH CREASES AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
6432-63722-0000 BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YOU FIGURE ON DOIN SOME DETECTING AND GIVING UP FISHIN
6432-63722-0001 AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST OF AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
6432-63722-0002 I AM GOING OFF FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING I MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
6432-63722-0003 GET READY SHAG YAS A COLONEL
6432-63722-0004 AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HAD HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH A DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
6432-63722-0005 PINKUS AND DONOVAN HAVEN'T THEY CAROL YE
6432-63722-0006 CAROL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CRAWL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
6432-63722-0007 WERE YOU GOING TO WORK ON THAT CASE COLONEL
6432-63722-0008 BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH THAT COLONEL THAN THAT CAT
6432-63722-0009 PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED GENERAL ASHLEY
6432-63722-0010 WE'VE GOT OUR MAN THAT'S ALL WE WANT
6432-63722-0011 YOU'RE ON A DARCY CASE THEY TELL ME IN A WAY YES
6432-63722-0012 I'M WORKING IN THE INTERESTS OF A YOUNG MAN
6432-63722-0013 IT'S JES ONE OF THEM COINCIDENCES LIKE
6432-63722-0014 BUSTED HIS HEAD ON WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE OF A PAIR
6432-63722-0015 GAD THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0016 THE VERY PEA I WAS GOING TO BUY
6432-63722-0017 LOOK HERE COLONEL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THIS
6432-63722-0018 AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DID WAS THE COOL ANSWER
6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGER PHUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63722-0020 NOW I'M AFRAID I WON'T AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN
6432-63722-0021 PHUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED SHERE ALI
6432-63722-0022 ANYHOW HE AND FOD DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL IT SEEMS
6432-63722-0023 NEIGHBORS OFTEN HEARD THEM SCRAPING A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
6432-63722-0024 TOWARDS DUSK A MAN WENT IN TO BUY A LAMP
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH A HEAD BUSTED IN AND THE HEAVY CANDLESTICK NEAR IT
6432-63722-0026 SOON HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
6432-63722-0027 MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOES TALKING IN THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBOURS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0028 AND A WATCH HAVE YOU IT YES IT'S HERE
6432-63722-0029 THAT'S A WATCH ANNOUNCED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE REACHING IN FOR IT GOING YET SEE
6432-63722-0030 YOU'RE NOT AS SQUEAMISH AS ALL THAT ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE WAS IN A DEAD MAN'S HANDS AND A WOMAN'S
6432-63722-0031 AND DONALM'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SCEPTICAL
6432-63722-0032 YES IT MAY HAVE HAD SOME ROUGH EDGES ON IT
6432-63722-0033 AS I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
6432-63722-0034 IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THEM A BIT
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WINDS IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO REMOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT OUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL
6432-63722-0038 AND DONNAN TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
6432-63722-0039 ASK THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE YES
6432-63722-0040 DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF ON IT WHENEVER YOU DO WHY NOT
6432-63722-0041 SIMPLY BECAUSE I WATCH

6432-63722-0043 ALL RIGHT BE THERE AND A SECOND
6432-63722-0044 SINGA FOUT WAS THE PANTING ANSWER
6432-63722-0045 I WANT TO TALK OVER DOROTHY'S CASE WITH YOU THE COLONEL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD THOUGHT HAD TALKED AGAIN AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
6432-63722-0046 WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM THE NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0047 RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FOOT PROPOSITION
6432-63722-0048 AT BEST HE WILL GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0049 AND YOU I DON'T WANT IT NEITHER
6432-63722-0050 BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW YOU KNOW
6432-63722-0051 BUT I NEED DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING OUT FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK

6432-63722-0053 IN FACT I HAVE A FEELING THAT I SHALL LAND MY FISH
6432-63722-0054 I'D RECOMMEND HIM TO YOU INSTEAD OF BLACKBURN THANKS LAPPED KENNETH
6432-63722-0055 WHAT IS IT PERHAPS CAN HELP YOU

6432-63722-0059 AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW IT
6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYING THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
6432-63723-0001 AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO A CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
6432-63723-0002 THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONI INQUIRED KENNETH
6432-63723-0003 NO I WASN'T THINK OF THAT
6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR THE DAY
6432-63723-0005 WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN
6432-63723-0006 IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE LEFT HIM
6432-63723-0007 IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATED GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT THE LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0009 THE JOURNAL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
6432-63723-0010 AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS VERY UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED
6432-63723-0011 HE WONDERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012 SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE CAN STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0013 MISS LARCH MADE NO DEFENCE
6432-63723-0014 LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGE AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELING WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL FEE
6432-63723-0016 NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE WILL PAY ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0017 AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO KEEP IT UP
6432-63723-0018 STILL I WILL LIKE TO KNOW
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD BE BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELLER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0020 IT HAD A DOUBLE POPULATION SO TO SPEAK
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALL ROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN THE DINING ROOM OR CAFE
6432-63723-0022 LARCH HIMSELF WAS THE PECULIAR CHARACTER
6432-63723-0023 IN THE SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
6432-63723-0024 AND IT WAS THE MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RACHFORD HAD MARRIED
6432-63723-0025 TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER HE WHISPERED MONEY
6432-63723-0026 BUT IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE
6432-63723-0027 SHE ALSO SOUGHT AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
6432-63723-0028 AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRIGHT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
6432-63723-0029 AND IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
6432-63723-0030 AND IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
6432-63723-0031 IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN A CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL
6432-63723-0032 MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW NANCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING TO BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
6432-63723-0033 DON'T HURRY IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0034 I AM GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT IT WOULD TAKE TIME
6432-63723-0035 IT'S HARD FOR MISS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BURNING UP LIKE A MAJOR
6432-63723-0036 SO KING GOT BAIT WHO PUT IT UP
6432-63723-0037 IT WAS HIM LARCH
6432-63723-0038 THEY TOOK ANNIE AWAY A WHILE AGO
6432-63723-0039 BUT HIS ARE PRETTY UNCERTAIN SHOES TO BE AND JUST THE SAME
6432-63723-0040 ONLY THAT I I DARCY HESITATED AND GREW RED
6432-63723-0041 GOOD EVENING COLONEL HE CALLED GENIALLY WILL YOU JOIN ME IN A WELSH REGIMENT
6432-63723-0042 THINK YOU NO
6432-63723-0043 I'M AFRAID MY DIGESTION ISN'T QUITE UP TO THIS AS I'VE HAD TO CUT OUT MY FISHING OF LATE
6432-63723-0044 NOW AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE DOOR ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER
6432-63723-0045 THE STOPPED CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE ANY THEORY
6432-63723-0046 THERE WERE THREE OF THEM THE CENTRE FIGURE BEING THAT OF HARRY KING AS HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOXICATED

6432-63723-0048 I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTURED TONE HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO USE YET OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE USE OF LATE
6432-63723-0049 I SAID WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED THE OTHER WEVE MISSED YOU
6432-63723-0050 I SAID I WERE GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY THOUGH WITH AN EFFORT
6432-63723-0051 WHY POLONIUS ONE ASKED
6432-63723-0052 BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT HE IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
6432-63723-0053 THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE THE SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
6432-63723-0054 IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN A JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
6432-63723-0055 I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WAS MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
6432-63723-0056 THAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELOR
6432-63723-0057 NOW HARRY KING HAS IT CRIED COLONEL ASHLEY
6938-70848-0000 ONLY THE SUN CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY AT NOON
6938-70848-0001 THE COLDS AND RHEUMATISM OF A RAINY MONTHS VANISHED
6938-70848-0002 ASKED A WORKER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YONKERS
6938-70848-0003 WILL DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US ONE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARM IN A SLING
6938-70848-0004 HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER ME BY THE DEVILS
6938-70848-0005 WHO ARE YOU TO DESTROY THIS LEGAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS LENIN A GERMAN
6938-70848-0006 WHO ARE YOU A COUNTER REVOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATIVE THE BELOVED ADAM
6938-70848-0007 YOU CALL YOURSELVES THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA
6938-70848-0008 THE PISANS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS
6938-70848-0009 WE KNOW WHAT THE PEASANTS SAY AREN'T THEY WORKING MEN LIKE OURSELVES
6938-70848-0010 THIS MAN HAD SPECIALLY WELCOMED THE CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PEASANTS
6938-70848-0011 THIS LAST FOR THE YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
6938-70848-0012 WHEREUPON THE OLD EXECUTOR COMMITTEE LEFT THE HALL
6938-70848-0013 DOWN WITH HIM THEY SCREAMED
6938-70848-0014 FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN WITH THE BOLSHEVIKA
6938-70848-0015 UPON MY RETURN I'VE VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANY ONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
6938-70848-0016 MEANWHILE A QUESTION OF THE STRATUS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
6938-70848-0017 BY DECLINING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO BLOCK THE ELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LAST SOCIAL REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
6938-70848-0020 THIS CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO BREAK WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
6938-70848-0021 FOLLOWED HIM OLENIN LISTENED TOO NOW WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
6938-70848-0022 THE FIRST AGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALIST AND THE LANDOWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CLOTHING RELATED
6938-70848-0023 THE DUMESS AND ZAM STOOFS WERE DROPPED
6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED
6938-70848-0025 HE SPOKE OF THE RUM CONVENTION
6938-70848-0026 THESE VILLAGES WILL SAVE US IN THE END
6938-70848-0027 BUT THE PRESENT MOMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IS INVINCIBLE
6938-70848-0028 THE WORLD OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN THE HALL
6938-70848-0029 A NEW HUMANITY WILL BE BORN IN THIS WAR
6938-70848-0030 I GREET YOU WITH THE CHRISTENING OF A NEW CHRISTIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM
7018-75788-0000 THEN I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED IN HIS SKULL AND HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
7018-75788-0001 BEHOLD A SHIP IS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THE DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
7018-75788-0002 HEARING THIS I WAS SORE TROUBLED REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERING FROM THE APE KIND
7018-75788-0003 ON THIS HE BROUGHT ME A COTTON BAG AND GIVING IT TO ME SAID TAKE THIS BAG AND FILL IT WITH PEBBLES FROM THE BEACH AND GO FORTH WITH A COMPANY OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO WHOM I WILL GIVE A CHARGE RESPECTING THEE
7018-75788-0004 DO AS THEY DO AND BELIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FOLLOW THY RETURN VOYAGE TO THY NATIVE LAND
7018-75788-0005 THEN HE CARRIED ME TO THE BEACH WHERE I FILLED MY BAG WITH PEBBLES LARGE AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLK ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH CARRYING A BAG LIKE MINE FILLED WITH PEBBLES
7018-75788-0006 TO THESE HE COMMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO HIS CARE AND SAYING THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY GET HIS DAILY BREAD AND YOU WILL EARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
7018-75788-0007 NOW SLEEPING UNDER THESE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES WHEREUPON MY COMPANION BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE FOLK
7018-75788-0008 WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF TO DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
7018-75788-0009 WHEN IT WAS THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINTH NIGHT
7018-75788-0010 AND CEASED NO SAILING TILL WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT BUSSORAH
7018-75788-0011 THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGHDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTER AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FOREGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STORE HOUSES
7018-75788-0012 AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GREAT PROFIT I HAD MADE
7018-75788-0013 NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING MAHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL CREATURES BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND WISHED HIM A GOOD DAY
7018-75788-0014 HERE I FOUND A GREAT SHIP READY FOR SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD WITH THEM GOODS OF PRICE SO I EMBARKED MY VALES THEREIN
7018-75788-0015 HAPPILY AMONGST YOU IS ONE RIGHTEOUS WHOSE PRAYER THE LORD WILL ACCEPT
7018-75788-0016 PRESENTLY THE SHIPS STRUCK THE MOUNTAIN AND BROKE UP AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD OF HER WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75788-0017 BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS COLOR AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE SAILORS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
7018-75788-0018 EACH THAT DIED I WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTHES AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE TILL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT A LITTLE PROVISION LEFT I WHO WAS WONT TO HAVE SO MUCH

7018-75789-0001 THEN SIGN FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND CORMORINE ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIP'S STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD MAKE ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
7018-75789-0002 LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE OF THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS A NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
7018-75789-0003 I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED A RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILE THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT IN MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0005 WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO THE ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
7018-75789-0006 BUT I WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THAT RIVER
7018-75789-0007 WHEN THEY SAW I UNDERSTOOD THEM NOT AND GAVE THEM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER

7018-75789-0010 WHEN IT WAS THE FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY SECOND NIGHT
7018-75789-0011 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMEN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HAD TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING THAT HE MAY ACQUAINT HIM WITH HIS ADVENTURES
7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND HE PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0013 SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OFF WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND

7018-75789-0017 HE ASKED ME WHENCE I CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER

7018-75789-0019 HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THIS AND AS FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS OPINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST EYE WITNESSED
7018-75789-0020 PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRYMAKINGS AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED
7018-75789-0021 SUCH THEN O MY BROTHERS IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL ME IN MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TO TOMORROW INSHALLAH
7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WOND'ROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS A FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OFT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD THE SEAMEN
7018-75789-0026 KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE AND ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH AND AM MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED TO SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLIMBED TO THE MASTHEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING AT HIS BEARD
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IT IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT THEY WHOSO COME HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS THE SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
7018-75789-0030 THE SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NAUGHT MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED IN THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO BLATTERBATH'S GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPORTING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 A JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY ASSISTANCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A RE ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DONNING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AND EXCITED MURMUR A DEATHLIKE HUSH
7105-2330-0007 THE FORE MAN DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE
7105-2330-0008 THE JURY FIND THEIR PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISH TO ADD A WRITER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A VI ELECTION IS PENDING IN A PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS ON HAND
7105-2330-0010 AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE POLL A JUNIOR COUNCIL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
7105-2330-0011 FIVE HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF
7105-2330-0012 OUR MAJORITY THE LAST TIME WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN
7105-2330-0013 SEVEN FIFTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTER BUFF IS OUT BEFORE THE POLE OPENS
7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RED RAPPA'S INN TO NIGHT
7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRIO LONG REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
7105-2330-0017 HE EXCLAIMED YOU WON'T GO
7105-2330-0018 HE SAYS HE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY THEM OUT AND HE'S NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW
7105-2330-0019 SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A RELIEF PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ESTIMATES
7105-2330-0020 ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BAN
7105-2330-0021 PAUL OPENEDS IN FIVE MINUTES
7105-2330-0022 IS PLADDERBUFF OUT YET
7105-2330-0023 IN HEAVENS NAME WHY
7105-2330-0024 THE CHIEF ORGANIZER RANG ON
7105-2330-0025 IT IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
7105-2330-0026 CAN'T YOU GET A STRIKE PERMIT ASK THE ORGANIZER
7105-2330-0027 I'LL TRY SAID THE OLD SECRETARY AND WENT TO THE TELEPHONE
7105-2330-0028 EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTING WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WE'LL VOTE THE OTHER WAY
7105-2330-0029 A TELEGRAM HAS BROUGHT IN
7105-2330-0030 IT WAS FROM THE CENTRAL COMEBY ROOMS AT NEMESIS
7105-2330-0031 WITHOUT A BAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BANDS
7105-2330-0032 ONE QUARTER PAST TEN HALF PAST
7105-2330-0033 HAD YOU ANY BAND INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY NATURE TO PLAY
7105-2330-0034 DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANIZER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS AND THOSE SORT OF THINGS
7105-2330-0035 THE WARDERS HAD A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THE MEN THEMSELVES
7105-2330-0036 LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID HIS CHIEF ORGANIZER
7105-2330-0037 THE POPULAR SONGS OF THE MOMENT REPLIED THE AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT TO THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONER STRODE FORWARD TO FREEDOM
7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF THE SON HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HULL
7105-2330-0040 THE SEAT IS LOST AFTER ALL BY A NARROW MATURITY
7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENCE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTERBAFF FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
7105-2340-0000 WITH THAT NOTORIOUS FAILINGS OF HIS HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON ONE WANTED IN ONE'S HOUSE
7105-2340-0001 WELL THE FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID THE HUSBAND OR THE DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE ESTATE
7105-2340-0002 BESIDES CYNICISM APART HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIS FILLING
7105-2340-0003 WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY NOT FAIRLY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVE NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THE THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY
7105-2340-0004 WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRED PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTEREFFECS OF A POLO ACCIDENT
7105-2340-0005 A WILFRED FIGENCOTE HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONORS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRED HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK
7105-2340-0006 AND THE INVITATION WAS AN UNPLEASANT ONE
7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOL DAYS ONWARD HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF CLEPHOMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION
7105-2340-0008 THE SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEON COT TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THEIR CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRED SAYING HE IS PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS
7105-2340-0009 SIGNED WILFRED PIGEONCO
7105-2340-0010 I SUPPOSE HE WAS BRINGING US A PRESENT FOR THE SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS
7105-2340-0011 HER TALK FLITTED NERVOUSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER
7105-2340-0012 IN A DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER THEIR NERVOUSNESS AND AWKWARDNESS INCREASED
7105-2340-0013 OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETER SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUEST THERE THEY ALL ARE
7105-2340-0014 SUCH NICE USEFUL GIFTS A FEW DIMPLICATES OF COURSE
7105-2340-0015 SEVEN CREAM BUGS PUT IN PETER
7105-2340-0016 I FEEL THAT WE MUST LIVE ON CREAM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
7105-2340-0017 OF COURSE SOME OF THEM WILL BE CHANGED
7105-2340-0018 I PUT IT DOWN BY THE CLARET JUG SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER
7105-2340-0019 VIGILANCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY CROWNED BY A SENSE OF VICTORY
7105-2340-0020 AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOODNIGHT TO THEIR VISITOR MISSUS PETER EXPRESSED HER CONVICTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN SOMETHING
7105-2340-0021 HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I'M HANGED IF HE CAN CARRY ONE OFF
7105-2340-0022 WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO
7105-2340-0023 WILFRID WAS LATE IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS
7105-2340-0024 IT'S AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE THE THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU
7105-2340-0025 IT WAS A LITTLE PRESENT FROM MY MOTHER AND MYSELF FOR HER SILVER WEDDING
7105-2340-0026 I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND YOU SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT RATHER AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING YOU
7105-2340-0027 THEY SNATCHER HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THESE MANY YEARS
7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNESTINE PAGE ANDCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPASE OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
7105-2340-0029 HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED BLINDLY AND DESPERATELY AT ONE ANOTHER
7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE KEEP A DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE ARE AT BREAKFAST
7105-2340-0031 SHE AROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS
7105-2340-0032 THE PIGEON COCKS HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION
7105-2340-0033 PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES AND A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
7105-2340-0034 MISSUS PETER TURNED TO HER GUEST WITH A CONFIDENTIAL COYNESS
7105-2340-0035 PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS A TRANSCENDENT FAMILY GOOD LORD
7105-2340-0036 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A SCEPTOMANIA LIKE COUSIN SNATCHER
7105-2340-0037 GRAVE LITTLE WOMAN SAID PETER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT
7902-96591-0000 I'M FROM THAT CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST
7902-96591-0001 DIDN'T CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO COME
7902-96591-0002 AND WHEN YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
7902-96591-0003 I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME AND I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE
7902-96591-0004 THAT MY FATHER SIR RIGDON GRAHAM HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE
7902-96591-0005 HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YOU MUST NOT TELL
7902-96591-0006 PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHEY WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARK LITTLE AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RASTROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 AND THIS COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA PARTICULARLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I'LL SOON SHOW EM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD STOP AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GO BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THAT WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE
7902-96591-0018 YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE THE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0019 NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WICKED IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN TWO PIECES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HAND WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE AND THE HAND WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
7902-96592-0000 SURE YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES FATHER

7902-96592-0004 TELL THEM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR AWAY TO NIGHT
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHIE REITSTROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER NAME HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEAL THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 BUT WHY DID ANDY CALL MISTER GURR FATHER
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS A INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0010 AND I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSED
7902-96592-0011 NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING ON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL WAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAIN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM AND JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 WREN WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM THIS SURPRISE
7902-96592-0016 HULLOO HE SAID WHO ARE YOU

7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR THE WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE CHIMNEYS PRESENTED ITSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT A LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATED SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASCENDING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK INTO THE SHEATH
7902-96592-0032 NO I CAN'T PART WITH THAT HA HA SAID THE BOY JEERINGLY

7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THAT CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISON VILLAGE SHE WENT TO WAVERLEY WHERE SHE WAS HOUNDED CONTINUALLY

7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPARDS RED MOCKERS AND BUD PENCE WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUANTRELL
7975-280076-0002 THE RAID WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BLOODSHED JUDGE MC LEAN THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FATALLY
7975-280076-0003 NO WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGERS BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAD INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION

7975-280076-0007 YOU MIGHT USE THIS LETTER IN YOUR OWN WAY
7975-280076-0008 I WILL GIVE YOU THIS OUTLINE OR SKETCH OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND ACTIONS AT THE TIME OF CERTAIN ROBBERIES WITH WHICH I AM CHARGED
7975-280076-0009 AT THE TIME OF THE GALLOTON BANK ROBBERING I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM PLEZ TAILOR AND RECTOR
7975-280076-0010 THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SHERIFF BARCLEY AND FIFTY OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
7975-280076-0011 I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS AND FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY
7975-280076-0012 I THEN WENT TO ARKANSAS AND WENT TO SAINT CLAIR COUNTY ABOUT THE FIRST OF MAY
7975-280076-0013 AND WENT TO KANSAS WHERE OUR CATTLE WERE IN WOODSON COUNTY AT COLONEL RIDGE'S
7975-280076-0014 DURING THE SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS BUT AS THERE WAS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED THE SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE I WAS
7975-280076-0015 I WENT TO INDEPENDENCE AND FROM THERE TO A S WEBBS
7975-280076-0016 THERE I TOOK DINNER AND THEN WENT TO DOCTOR L W T WEMAN'S
7975-280076-0017 OUR BUSINESS THERE WAS TO SEE E P WEST HE WAS NOT AT HOME AND THE FAMILY WILL REMEMBER THAT WE WERE THERE
7975-280076-0018 WE CROSSED THE BRIDGE STAYED IN THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING WE RODE UP THROUGH THE CITY
7975-280076-0019 I MET SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AMONG THEM WAS BOB HUDS
7975-280076-0020 WE WERE NOT ON GOOD TERMS AT THE TIME NOR HAVE WE FOR SEVERAL YEARS
7975-280076-0021 POOR JACK HE HAS BEEN HUNTED DOWN AND SHOT LIKE A WILD BEAST AND NEVER WAS A BOY MORE INNOCENT
7975-280076-0022 DOCTOR L L LEWIS WAS HIS PHYSICIAN
7975-280076-0023 THERE WERE FIFTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS THERE WHO WILL TESTIFY IN ANY COURT THAT JOHN AND I ARE THERE
7975-280076-0024 HELVIN FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WERE ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND EITHER OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE ABOVE FOR JOHN AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MISTER SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND WAS IN THIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MISTER AND MISS FICKLE AFTER THE SERVICE
7975-280076-0025 ABOUT THE LAST OF SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE I ARRIVED IN CARROLL PARISH LOUISIANA
7975-280076-0026 I STAYED THERE UNTIL THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
7975-280076-0027 I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THE TIME I WAS AT NEESIO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAY
7975-280076-0028 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY AT ADEN IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY
7975-280084-0000 I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED WE SHOULD NOT SHOOT ONE
7975-280084-0001 WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY WOOD BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT INTO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
7975-280084-0002 WHEN THEY CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
7975-280084-0003 J S ALLAN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN ROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
7975-280084-0004 GET YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY'RE ROBBING THE CAMP
7975-280084-0005 AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS AT THE BRIDGE THAT HE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
7975-280084-0006 ALMOST THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT IN THE BANK
7975-280084-0007 CHADWELL WOODS AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
7975-280084-0008 IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN THOSE
7975-280084-0009 MEANTIME THE STREETS WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY HOT
7975-280084-0010 EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOOTERS INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7975-280084-0011 DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UP STAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREETS
7975-280084-0012 CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED ROLLER'S MARE
7975-280084-0013 WHAT KEPT YO SO LONG I ASKED PITTS
7975-280084-0014 AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE A BANK I TAKE THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0015 WHERE'S THE MONEY OUTSIDE THIS SAFE BOB ASKED
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL FITZ CHASED THEM WITH A BULLET
7975-280084-0017 THE FIRST ONE MISSED HIM BUT THE SECOND WENT OVER HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
7975-280085-0000 THAT NIGHT IT STARTED A RAIN AND WE WORE OUT OUR HORSES
7975-280085-0001 FRIDAY WE MOVED TOWARD WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMPED BETWEEN ELYSIA AND GERMAN LAKE
7975-280085-0002 BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARM HOUSE CLOSE TO MANCATO
7975-280085-0003 THAT DAY A MAN NAMED DUNNING DISCOVERED US AND WE TOOK HIM PRISONERS
7975-280085-0004 FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE AGREED NOT TO IT
7975-280085-0005 NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POST HASTE TO MANCADO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
7975-280085-0006 THE WHISTLE IN THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS THE SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
7975-280085-0007 HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH THIS PILLAR ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
7975-280085-0008 BUT THEY SOON AFTER GOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM BROKE HIS WALKING STICK WITH A SHOT
7975-280085-0009 WE WERE IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG SAWED HORSES WHEN THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE ANIMAL AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
7975-280085-0010 SIX STEPS TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T O WALT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J SEAVERSON
7975-280085-0011 FORMING IN LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE OF THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ARABS WERE DISCOVERED
7975-280085-0012 MAKE FOR THE HORSES I SAYS EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
7975-280085-0013 THERE IS NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHARGE EM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN
7975-280085-0014 I GOT UP AS A SIGNAL FOR THE CHARGE AND FIRED ONE VOLLEY
7975-280085-0015 ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUNS LEVELED ON BOB IN SPITE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS A FLAG OF TRUCE
7975-280085-0016 SHERIFF GLISPIN OF WATAWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
7975-280085-0017 INCLUDING THOSE RECEIVED IN AND ON THE WAY FROM NORTHVILLE I HAD ELEVEN WOUNDS
7975-280085-0018 AND SHERIFF GLINSPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTECTORATE THAT MINNESOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
8131-117016-0000 OH CAPTAIN MURDOCK
8131-117016-0001 BUT MARSPORT HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO KILL OFF
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MAR'S LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MEN
8131-117016-0003 THE STONEWALL GANG NUMBERS PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DARELXING FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORIES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF A MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THOUGH NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAVE PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0007 CAPTAIN MURDOCK WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND NOW WAS ASKING FOR MORE MAN
8131-117016-0008 THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET EM FOR HIM
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OFF MIXED WITH A VAGUE RELIEF
8131-117016-0010 I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN IT THE WAY WE WOULD ON EARTH
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS ANY ONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT
8131-117016-0012 THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THE STONE WALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON
8131-117016-0013 HE PICKED OUT THREE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FIVE WILL COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TO NIGHT PICK ANY ROUTE THAT'S OPEN O K NOW LET'S GO
8131-117016-0015 BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCK'S EYES FELL UPON HIM EARTH COP
8131-117016-0016 TWO YEARS GORDON MUTTERED
8131-117016-0017 TO A SECOND GORDON CURSED HIMSELF
8131-117016-0018 HE BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT SECURITY AND
8131-117016-0019 NOBODY HAD TRIED TO GO IN TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHORA BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREETS THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE CITIZEN WHO WAS DYING OF LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THE FINELY TURNED CLUB ON HIS HANDS
8131-117016-0024 GORDON'S EYES POPPED TO THAT
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWED THE SENTIMENT HIS OLD CLUB WAS MOVING NOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER TWO COPS HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
8131-117016-0027 HE DROPPED HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEYS
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPPIES STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0029 TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL THE WAGONS
8131-117016-0030 THEY'RE NOT USING WAGONS MURDOCK TOLD HIM LINE THEM UP
8131-117016-0031 WHEN THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED CAREFULLY
8131-117016-0032 MURDOCK INDICTED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS CLEAR AS GORDON'S FELT
8131-117016-0034 I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU REMEMBER HE TOLD THE MAN
8131-117016-0035 UNCLE THEY'D KILL ME I DON'T KNOW
8131-117016-0036 MURDOCK TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND TURNED TO THE WRETCHED TOFTS
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL FIND YOU
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER THO
8131-117016-0039 MURDOCKS SENT ONE OF THE MEN TO PICK UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD
8131-117016-0040 AND A THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN WHO'D BEEN BEATEN BEFORE
8131-117016-0041 GOT A STRETCHER AND TAKE HIM WHEREVER HE BELONGS HE ORDERED
8131-117016-0042 BUT THE CAPTAIN STIRRED QUIETLY SIGHING
8131-117016-0043 NOW THE COPSE THEY'RE GIVING ME WE'RE COVERED GORDON
8131-117016-0044 BUT THE STONEWALL GANG IS BACKING WAINS
8131-117016-0045 BUT ITS GOING TO BE TOUGH ON THEM
8131-117016-0046 BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE GOT A YELLOW TICKET TO SECURITY
8131-117016-0047 MURDOCH BLINKED HE DROPPED HIS EYES SLOWLY
8131-117016-0048 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAIN WILL BE RE ELECTTED
8131-117016-0049 NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AN THOSE IN POWER
8131-117016-0050 EVER SEE A MODERN ELECTION
8131-117016-0051 NO YOU'RE A FISTER HE CAN'T LOSE
8131-117016-0052 AN THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH THEIR DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WHAT THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE SPARE RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0055 COST MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE IZZY IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE THINKS IT
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEAS ON THE STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
8131-117016-0058 THE GROUPS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCK WAS TRAINING A NEW SQUAD EVERY DAY
8131-117016-0059 IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING IS HERE
8131-117016-0060 THIS SHOULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D SEEN ON EARTH
8131-117016-0061 BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAIN WAS REE ELECTED
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHORED BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORISED PRECINCT HOUSE
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANY HE HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117017-0002 AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HAYEY'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117017-0003 GORDON HIT THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MARS SPEEDER LET OUT A SHRILL WHISTLE
8131-117017-0004 GUNS SUDDENLY CEASED TO BE FLOURISHING EVERYWHERE
8131-117017-0005 YOU CAN'T DO IT OF ME
8131-117017-0006 I'M WARNED I'M GOING STRAIGHT
8131-117017-0007 YOU DAMNED COPSE CAN'T ON YOU WAS BLUBBERING
8131-117017-0008 ONE LOOK WAS ENOUGH THE WORK PAPERS HAD THE TELLTALE OVER THICKENING OF THE SIGNATURE THAT HAD SHOWED ON OTHER PAPERS OBVIOUSLY FORGERIES
8131-117017-0009 SOME TURNED AWAY AS GORDON AND THE OTHER COB WENT TO WORK BUT MOST OF THEM WEREN'T SQUEAMISH
8131-117017-0010 WHEN IT WAS OVER THE TWO PICKED UP HER WHIMPERING CAPTIVE
8131-117017-0011 JENKINS THE OTHER COB HAD BEEN HOLDING THE WALLET
8131-117017-0012 MUST HAVE BEEN MAKING A BIG CONTACT OF SOMETHING FIFTY FIFTY
8131-117017-0013 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OVER TWO THOUSAND CREDIT IN THE WALLET
8131-117017-0014 WHEN GORDON AND JENKS CAME BACK MURDOCK TOSSED THE MONEY TO THEM SPLIT IT
8131-117017-0015 WHATEVER COMES TO HAND GO
8131-117017-0016 AT THE SOCIAL CALL GORDON ASKED HIM

8131-117017-0027 THANKS IZZIE THANKS YES
8131-117017-0028 THE SKID POCKETED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY NODDING
8131-117017-0029 THE LITTLE GUY KNEW MARS AS FEW OTHERS DO APPARENTLY FROM ALL SIDES
8131-117017-0030 AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COOPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN ISSY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USE THE INFORMATION WITH A BEAT SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT TO THE UPPER BRACKETS HE'D STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS
8131-117017-0031 THE CAPTAIN LOOKED COMPLETELY BEATEN AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM AND DROPPED UPON TO THE BENCH
8131-117017-0032 GO ON GET DAMN IT

8188-269288-0028 SHE WENT ROUND THE ROOM
8188-269288-0029 NOW I REMEMBER SHE GOT A LETTER THAT UPSET HER VERY MUCH AND WENT OUT
8188-269288-0030 LESLIE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND FLUNG IT OPEN SHE PUT HER HEAD OUT AND TRIED TO PEER INTO THE DARKNESS BUT THE MOON HAD ALREADY SET AND SHE COULD NOT SEE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF YARDS IN FRONT OF HER

8188-269290-0033 BUT MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LISLEY AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
8188-269290-0034 MISS LAUDERDALE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHER TUTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE DIFFERENT HALLS ON THE RAISED PLATFORM
8188-269290-0035 THEN A ROLL CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE WAS ON COLCHESTER
8188-269290-0036 THE PHYSICAL PART OF YOUR TRAINING AND ALSO THE MENTAL PART ARE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED IN THIS GREAT HOUSE OF LEARNING SHE CONTINUED AND THE SPIRITUAL PART IT SEEMS TO ME OUGHT NOW TO BE STRENGTHENED

8188-269290-0048 AFTER THE ADDRESSES THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
8188-269290-0049 IT WAS ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK WHEN SHE LEFT THE HALL
8188-269290-0050 JUST AS SHE IS DOING SO MISS FRERE CAME UP
8188-269290-0051 ANNE COLCHESTER IS YOUR ROOMFELLOW IS SHE NOT SHE SAID
8188-269290-0052 I SEE BY YOUR FACE MISSUS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DISTRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING YOU KEEPING ANYTHING BACK
8188-269290-0053 I AM AFRAID I AM REPLIED LIZZIE DISTRESSED NOW IN HER TURN
8188-269290-0054 I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS LORDALE EXCEPT A VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED HERSELF
8188-269290-0055 THE EXCUSES MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
8188-269290-0056 THAT GIRL WHO BREAKS THE RULES HAS TO BE PUNISHED
8188-269290-0057 I'LL TELL HER
8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN HIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHILE THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE TO HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MONTORRES OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICIALS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE CRIMINAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0004 WHAT THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER IT
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW OF FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME BEFORE MYSELF
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION AWAKE THESE SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UP A COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVE LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALL FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0007 HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE CONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE CORNWEALTH
8188-274364-0008 MY LORDS I HAVE NOW SERVED YOUR LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG VANE FALLING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THE MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO PIM WHO NOW PRODUCED A PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THE DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF OUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT
8280-266249-0000 OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF FRIENDS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR COULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STREAMED OUT OF THE HARBOR
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LAMP HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0004 THERE ARE SUCH NICE LOOKING PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0005 BESIDES OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RANNAD LAUGHING
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ANSWERED THAT LITTLE GROUP YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILD I SUPPOSE
8280-266249-0007 AND WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF A HERALD I SHOULD JUDGE
8280-266249-0008 DO YOU SON WAS A SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009 HE SURELY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE BOY
8280-266249-0010 SUPPOSE YOU AND SHE SHAKE HANDS FRANK
8280-266249-0011 I DO INDEED THOUGH PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR AILMENTS
8280-266249-0012 DOUBTLESS THAT IS A CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THIS GENTLEMAN'S CABIN WHERE THERE'S A LIGHT
8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT THE SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT OF TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF A DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARMS WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE TO DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0017 IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENT
8280-266249-0018 THAT THE FRENCH POLYTECHNICA INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECT ON THE MIND
8280-266249-0019 NOTICE THE MULTITUDE OF WOODEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEWERS
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN OF A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0021 AND THEY SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0022 HINT A RESORT TO CIDER AND BEER
8280-266249-0023 NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE YOUR OWN
8280-266249-0024 FOR YE ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GODS
8280-266249-0025 WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR WIVES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE FULLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF HIS INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALY
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE TO THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND NOT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THE GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0030 THEY'RE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THE YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0031 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY WAS AT ONCE TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION
8280-266249-0032 NOW SIR HE IS NOT HERE
8280-266249-0033 AND THE DOOR SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TOO
8280-266249-0034 NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0035 HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING A LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING TO HIS STATEROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0036 WHAT DOES IT MEAN ASKED ONE
8280-266249-0037 A VENTRILOQUISTING BOARD OF COURSE RETURNED ANOTHER LET'S FOLLOW AND SEE THE FUN
8280-266249-0038 I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REMARKED THE FIRST LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT COME
8280-266249-0039 THAT FELLOW NICK WARD WAS A NOTED BLACK LEG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE
8280-266249-0040 WHO ASKED THE MATE I'VE SEEN NOBODY UP HERE THOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THE STEERAGE
8280-266249-0041 THEY HEARD IT IN SILENCE WITH A COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8280-266249-0042 A MAN OF GIANT SIZE OF HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0043 LET ME GO YELLED WARDER MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIS ARMS
8280-266249-0044 I DINKS NO I DINKS I DID YOU VON LESSION RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
8280-266249-0045 THE ROMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0046 MISTER LISBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0047 BUT THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSION
8280-266249-0048 I KEPT IT UP TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT
8280-266249-0049 THEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN HIS STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD MAKE IT UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0050 AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STAKES WAS VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0051 THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND THEN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREEN BACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THIS DREAD SOUND
8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SATE DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS WITH A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
8280-266249-0054 IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED WARDE LOOK WHAT'S THERE LOOK YOURSELF
8280-266249-0055 WHAT CAN IT HAVE BEEN THEY ASK EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0056 OH NONSENSE WHAT FOOLS THEY ARE
8280-266249-0057 THAT WAS THE LAST GAME OF CARDS FOR THAT TRIP
8280-266249-0058 THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0059 TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DAILIES WERE IN VERY STRAIT AND CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0060 OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARES UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE

8280-266249-0062 ELSIE ANSWERED PRESSING HER HAND AFFECTIONATELY ARE WE NOT SISTERS OF CHRIST

8461-278226-0001 SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED A SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WEAR THE NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JUBIN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTORIZE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-278226-0003 I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES IN MODERN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
8461-278226-0004 I REMEMBER ALL THE REUBENS IN THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
8461-278226-0005 SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH PEARL GREY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AYESHA BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0006 HE WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF HIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0007 BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN IN A GALLERY
8461-278226-0008 PHILIP JOCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HIS WIFE MADE A DISCOVERY
8461-278226-0009 HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE FOR PHILIP LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
8461-278226-0010 I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MOURNING ROOM AT JOCELYN STROC
8461-278226-0011 SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH COUNTESS PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KIRSTOLL LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
8461-278226-0012 THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF ON THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
8461-278226-0013 BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY IS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARDS THE WORKS OF OTHERS
8461-278226-0014 I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HOUSE
8461-278226-0015 YOU WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOUR PHILIP IF YOU LL SAY YES
8461-281231-0000 HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK NIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THE WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS
8461-281231-0001 IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORKELE STONE
8461-281231-0002 AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH FEARS OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
8461-281231-0003 WHY ART THOU HE EXCLAIMED IN TERROR
8461-281231-0004 LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH EURES WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
8461-281231-0005 EXCLAIMED THE NORMAN WHO
8461-281231-0006 REMEMBEREST THOU THE MAGAZINE OF FUEL WHICH IS STORED BENEATH THESE APARTMENTS WOMAN
8461-281231-0007 THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID EURICA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD ON THOSE WHO WOULD EXTINGUISH THEM
8461-281231-0008 MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF A CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
8461-281231-0009 THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY THE BRACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WAS AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
8461-281231-0010 THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCED HIS WAY INWARDS IN DESPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
8461-281231-0011 TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE LEADER'S EFFORT TO STOP THEM
8461-281231-0012 THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE ROMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL WRUNG WITH FURIOUS BLOWS
8461-281231-0013 AT LENGTH DE BRAY FELL
8461-281231-0014 TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK MY PLEASURE ON ME
8461-281231-0015 YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS THEE TO SAY
8461-281231-0016 EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER AND
8461-281231-0017 THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THAT CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAMBER
8461-281231-0018 RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH EASE THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURTHEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS
8461-281231-0019 BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED WITH THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT FRONT DE BOEUF
8461-281231-0020 AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE EUREA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
8461-281231-0021 BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND AROSE THROUGH THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTER
8461-281231-0022 AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED THE TYRANT
8461-281231-0023 WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORKLESTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
8461-281231-0024 HE LEFT A GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF KOENIGSBURG AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTER OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ADDLESTANE WAS LAID
8461-281231-0025 DEBRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOODS
8461-281231-0026 HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT A MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING
8461-281231-0027 SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS GRAND WAR HORSE AND RODE OFF THROUGH THE FOREST
8461-281231-0028 DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORK STOOD MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER REBECCA
8461-281231-0029 AND WITH THIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS FATHER'S LIBERATION
8461-281231-0030 THE TEMPLAR HAS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FROM DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
8461-281231-0031 HE APPEALED TO THE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST A MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
8461-281231-0032 BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LYCAS THE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON A VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY
8461-281231-0033 HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLAR AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
8461-281231-0034 SIR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK ROUND AND TO MAKE INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
8461-281231-0036 SHE GAZED EXCEEDINGLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
8461-281231-0037 AT HIS FEET WAS PLACED A TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
8461-281231-0038 THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE ARE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THEIR SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
