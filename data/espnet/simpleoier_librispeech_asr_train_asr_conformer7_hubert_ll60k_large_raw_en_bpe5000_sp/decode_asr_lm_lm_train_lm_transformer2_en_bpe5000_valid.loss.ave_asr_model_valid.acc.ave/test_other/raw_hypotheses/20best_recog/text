1688-142285-0000 THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANTON
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUESTS DOWN STAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHILE MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME AS SILLY
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF RATHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHIPBOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HELLSTONE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT YOU HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AND SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0008 HIS FATHERS DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAVE TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP MY MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARD IMMEDIATELY AND MISTER THORNTON IT IS NOT WONT I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0014 AS THEY LEFT MILTON
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINTED ASK HER FATHER
1688-142285-0016 O PAPA BY THE TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0017 AND WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM OF BEING RICH
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER DID THAT
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT HIS WORDS
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S DRAWING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRULY MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER THAT IT CAME
1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT FORTUNATELY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0025 OR I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0026 PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AN ALL
1688-142285-0027 I DON'T SET HIM UP TO A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0028 BUT GOOD NIGHT FATHER
1688-142285-0029 THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG AROUND MISSUS HALE
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN HER BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME BACK CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CALLED A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORNE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THEIR MILAN LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO HAVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND A VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND PAUSED TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0037 WELL BITSY HOW ARE YOU
1688-142285-0038 BETTER IS NOT BETTER IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
1688-142285-0039 NOT EXACTLY REPLIED GILBERT SMILING
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED OF MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND OF BOULAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FURTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED AROUND TO WALK ALONG SIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
1688-142285-0042 AS FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0043 AT LAST SHE SAID IN THE LOW VOICE
1688-142285-0044 BESSY DO NOT WISH TO DIE
1688-142285-0045 BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE SPOKE
1688-142285-0046 BUT WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
1688-142285-0047 BUT WHAT WAS IT IT
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE AS PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON
1688-142285-0049 I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FROM THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
1688-142285-0050 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I LIVE WITH YOU NOW
1688-142285-0051 THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS HE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY WENT UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
1688-142285-0053 YOU'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GROLLISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0054 BUT NEVERTHELESS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
1688-142285-0055 GASPED HESSY AT LAST
1688-142285-0056 ESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT'S OR MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER WHO GIVE IT TO YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS
1688-142285-0059 NOW I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED FOR
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN ALL I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0061 I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AN NO MORE
1688-142285-0062 THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG GIRL
1688-142285-0063 YOU DON'T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY A BIG DEAL
1688-142285-0064 BUT WHO'S COME AT LAST AND WHO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HE'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT WE KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT
1688-142285-0065 IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HOW TO WORK
1688-142285-0066 BUT THE GIRL AS HE PLAYED IT THE MORE WITH MARGARET
1688-142285-0067 DON'T THINK HARDLY ON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE'S
1688-142285-0068 I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOULED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF ARTHUR IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0069 THE FEVERISH COLOR CAME INTO HER CHEEK AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYE
1688-142285-0070 BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL ALL MY HEART
1688-142285-0071 SHE PUT HER HAND TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY
1688-142285-0072 MOTHER HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
1688-142285-0073 PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROSE HERSELF AND SAID
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL BUT JUST SAY THAT
1688-142285-0075 I'VE COME TO MORROW SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0076 MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
1688-142285-0077 SHE WAS LATE FOR TEA TO HOME
1688-142285-0078 HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERVANT TOO

1688-142285-0088 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ASKED

2033-164914-0015 NOW WHEN THE FIREMAN HEARD THESE WORDS HE FEARED FOR ZAL AL MAKAN AND WEPT WITH EXCEEDING WEEPING AND SAID TO THE EUNUCH BY ALLAH IT WAS NOT I I KNOW HIM NOT

2033-164915-0000 AND ALSO THOSE
2033-164915-0001 THEN SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HE GATHERED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THEIR TWAIN FELL DOWN IN A FAINTING FIT
2033-164915-0002 WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW THIS CAUSE HE WONDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEWHAT TO COVER THEM WAITED TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
2033-164915-0003 AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND UZAT AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LEFT HER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THE VERSES
2033-164915-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANTS HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM BUT HOW HE HAD GOT FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BUYING HOW HE HAD MADE A MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD GONE IN TO HER AND HOW THE KING THAT SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARRKAN
2033-164915-0005 BUT NOW GO TO THAT MASTER AND BRING HIM QUICKLY TO ME
2033-164915-0006 THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED A CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE STOCKER UNTIL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRDING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
2033-164915-0007 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHILE THE STALKER GIRDED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING O WOULD I KNEW WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM
2033-164915-0008 I BELIEVE HE HATH DENOUNCED ME TO THE EUNUCH HENCE THESE PAGES AT ABOUT ME AND HE HATH MADE ME AN ACCOMPLICE IN THIS CRIME

2033-164915-0011 TWAS AS I FEARED THE COMING EVILS DISCERNING BUT UNTO ALLAH WE ARE ALL RETURNING
2033-164915-0012 THEN THE EUNUCH CRIED UPON THEIR PAGES SAYING TAKE HIM OFF THE ASS
2033-164915-0013 AND HE ANSWERED I AM THE CHAMBERLAIN OF THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS KING SHARRKAN SON OF OMAR BIN AL NUMAN LORD OF BAGDAD AND OF THE LANDS OF KHORASAN AND I BRING TRIBUTE AND PRESENTS FROM HIM TO HIS FATHER IN BAGDAD
2033-164915-0014 SO FARE YE FORWARDS NO HARM SHALL BEFALL YOU TILL YOU JOIN HIS GRAND WAZIR DANAN
2033-164915-0015 THEN HE BADE HIM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO HIM OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND THE TRIBUTE OF SYRIA
2033-164915-0016 SO IT WAS AGREED THAT WE GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARCAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHER'S REALM

2033-164916-0002 WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREATER JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAYNE TELL ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFELL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
2033-164916-0003 ZAUMA KHAN BOWED HIS HEAD A WHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELLED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM ON THE RIGHT WAY
2033-164916-0004 THEN HE ADDED O MY UNCLE HOW SHALL I DO WITH MY BROTHER SHAHRKAN
2033-164916-0005 AFTER A WHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE POOL TIRED SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY

2033-164916-0007 AND IN IT ALL REJOICED AT THE ACCESSION OF THE LADY OF THE PLACE
2033-164916-0008 LASTLY THE MINISTER WENT IN AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE ZAR AL MAKAN WHO ROSE TO MEET HIM SAYING WELCOME O WAZIR AND SIRE'S SONSPIER
2033-164916-0009 MOREOVER THE SULTAN COMMANDED HIS WAZIR DENDAN CALL A TEN DAYS HALT OF THE ARMY THAT HE MIGHT BE PRIVATE WITH HIM AND LEARN FROM HIM HOW AND WHEREFORE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN SLAIN

2414-128291-0000 WHAT HATH HAPPENED UNTO HER
2414-128291-0001 HE ASKED HIMSELF SOMETHING WARM AND MOVING QUICKENETH ME IT MUST BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
2414-128291-0002 WHEN HOWEVER ZATHUSTRA WAS QUITE NIGH UNTO THEM THEN DID HE HEAR PLAINLY THAT A HUMAN VOICE SPAKE IN THE MIDST OF THE CAIN AND APPARENTLY ALL OF THEM HAD TURNED THEIR HEADS TOWARD THE SPEAKER

2414-128291-0019 THEY ALSO ABSTAIN FROM ALL HEAVY THOUGHTS WHICH INFLATE THE MIND
2414-128291-0020 THAT
2414-128291-0021 SAID ZARATHUSTRA THOU SHOULD'ST ALSO SEE MINE ANIMALS MINE EAGLE AND MY SERPENT THEIR LIKE DO NOT AT PRESENT EXIST ON EARTH
2414-128291-0022 AND TOOK TO MINE ANIMALS OF THE HAPPINESS OF ANIMALS

2414-128292-0004 THUS SPAKE THE TOO STRATE TO HIS HEART AND RAN AWAY
2414-128292-0005 VERILY MY FOLLY HAD GROWN GOOD IN THE MOUNTAINS
2414-128292-0006 NOW DO I HEAR SIX OLD FOOL'S EGGS RATTLING BEHIND ONE ANOTHER
2414-128292-0007 BUT DOTH ZATHUSTRA CEASE TO BE FRIGHTENED BY HIS SHADOW
2414-128292-0008 ALSO METHINKETH THAT AFTER ALL IT HATH LONGER OR LESS THAN MIND
2414-128292-0009 FOR WHEN THEIR ATUSTRA SCRUTINIZED HIM WITH ITS GLANCE HE WAS FRIGHTENED AS BY A SUDDEN APPARITION SO SLENDER SWARTHY HOLLOW AND WORN OUT DID HIS FOLLOWER APPEAR
2414-128292-0010 ASKED ZITUSTRA VEHEMENTLY WHAT DOEST THOU HERE

2414-128292-0015 WHEN THE DEVIL CASTETH HIS SKIN DOTH NOT HIS NAME ALSO FALL AWAY IT IS ALSO TAKEN
2414-128292-0016 THE DEVIL HIMSELF IS PERHAPS IGNORANT
2414-128292-0017 SOMETIMES HE MEANT TO LIE AND BEHOLD
2414-128292-0018 THEN ONLY DID I ADMIT THE TRUTH
2414-128292-0019 WHY HAVE I STILL INCLINATIONS
2414-128292-0020 HAVE I STILL A LITTLE
2414-128292-0021 A HAVEN TOWARDS WHICH MY SOUL IS SET
2414-128292-0022 FOR IT TOO I ASK AND SEEK AND HAVE SOUGHT BUT HAD NOT FOUND IT
2414-128292-0023 O ETERNAL EVERYWHERE WHERE O ETERNAL NOWHERE O ETERNAL IN VAIN
2414-128292-0024 THOU ART MY SHADOWS
2414-128292-0025 SAID HE AT LAST AS SADLY
2414-128292-0026 THY DANGER IS NOT SMALL THOU FREE SPIRIT AND WATCHER
2414-128292-0027 THEY SLEEP QUIETLY THEY ENJOY OF THEIR NEW SECURITY
2414-128292-0028 BEWARE LEST IN THE END A NARROW FAITH CAPTUREED THEE A HARD RIGOROUS DELUSION
2414-128292-0029 FOR NOW EVERYTHING THAT IS NARROW AND CONFUSED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTETH THEE
2414-128292-0030 THOU HAST LOST THY GIRL
2414-128292-0031 THOU POOR ROVER AND RAMBLER' THOU TIRED BUTTERFLY
2414-128292-0032 WILT THOU HAVE A REST OR A HOME THIS EVENING
2414-159411-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAHMIN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME INTO AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM
2414-159411-0001 THE BRAHMIN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF MY CAGE YOU WILL EAT ME
2414-159411-0002 O FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN ALL TRUTH THAT I WILL NOT
2414-159411-0003 I WILL NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL BUT LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND RETURN
2414-159411-0004 THEN THE BRAHMIN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO THAN A TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARD
2414-159411-0005 SO THE BRAHMIN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A BANDANT TREE AND THE BRAHMIN SAID TO IT BANNON TREE BANNON TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0006 ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE BANANT TREE
2414-159411-0007 THIS TIGER SAID THE BRAMIN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF A CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LEFT HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME
2414-159411-0008 IT IS JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO FOR NO
2414-159411-0009 LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MEN ARE THE UNGRATEFUL RACE
2414-159411-0010 AND SIR CAMEL SIR CAMEL CRIED THE BRAHMAN HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0011 AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND A BULLOCK LYING BY THE ROAD
2414-159411-0012 IS IT FAIR THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NOTHING
2414-159411-0013 AND LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MEN HAVE NO PITY
2414-159411-0014 THREE OUT OF THE SIX AND GIVE JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMIN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINED TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
2414-159411-0015 ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT AGAINST THE EAGLE
2414-159411-0016 THE BRAHMAIN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONES
2414-159411-0017 THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID JUDGMENT OF ALL AS AGAINST YOU O BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0018 AFTER THIS THEY SAW AN ALLIGATION AND THE BRAHMIN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE VERDICT
2414-159411-0019 BUT THE ALLIGATORS SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OUT OF THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KILL ME
2414-159411-0020 THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINION OF THE SIXTH JUDGES
2414-159411-0021 KNOW THE SIXTH WAS A JACKAL
2414-159411-0022 THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKAL UNCLE JACKA SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0023 SHOW ME THE PICTURE
2414-159411-0024 THEN THE GUARD THERE THE JACKALS SAID NOW BRAHMIN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD
2414-159411-0025 EXACTLY SIR WAS IT ASKED THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0026 EXACTLY HERE SAID THE BRAMIN
2414-159411-0027 WHERE WAS HIS TIGER THEN
2414-159411-0028 WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE TIGER JUMPING IN THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON THIS SIDE
2414-159411-0029 VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE JACKAL BUT I CANNOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY
2414-159411-0030 SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE BRAHEMIN
2414-159411-0031 THEN SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE JACK
2414-159411-0032 WHEN THE BRAHMIN HAD DONE THIS THE JACKAL SAID OH YOU WICKED AN UNGRATEFUL TIGER
2414-159411-0033 WHEN A GOOD BRAHMIN OPENED YOUR CARRIAGE DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WILL MAKE
2414-159411-0034 PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEY LORD BRAHMAN
2414-159411-0035 YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY AND BEHIND THIS
2414-165385-0000 THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUET AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLATTERING PACOMB BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILISED MONKEY
2414-165385-0001 THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS SENTENCED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THE FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMIC WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU
2609-156975-0000 AND THE MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN
2609-156975-0001 HOWDORNE HOPHAST HADOUBT PATS SINCE HIS GENIUS
2609-156975-0002 LET'S HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MATRON MIGHT AND IN THAT CASE LET'S DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
2609-156975-0003 THE ELECTRIC BACKGROUND OF THE BONDAGE
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHOSE TURBANT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KEIMERATPATH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST PABLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIANS AND SCRIPZONS GIVE OF THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF SOME DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY A PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ALTAMI CORVETTES INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES PROSPERED TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDO WERE THE CHIEF FACTORS IN ITS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
2609-156975-0008 THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATION OF OUR SOJOURN IN EGYPT
2609-156975-0009 THE LATER TRADITIONS AND TO EXTEND THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY PATHAM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATUM
2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY IN SCRIPT AND ULCER STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHAM THE HOUSE OF RAMESES A CITY WITH THE ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES
2609-156975-0012 THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS SERRENNY WAS NATURALLY INEVITABLE
2609-156975-0013 WAS ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM IT THE DESPOTIC ROAR OF THAT LANDY DAY
2609-156975-0014 THE MAKING OF A CIVIL PATRIOT
2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES'S BIRTH IN AN EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
2609-156975-0016 WHERE'S MOSES JUST FINDIN RESISTIN THE GYPSIN TACKS MASTER
2609-156975-0017 IS THE PENIONAGE ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
2609-156975-0018 NIGHT'REE HE WENT TO THE LAND O MIDIAN
2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN A PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPT AND FUGITIVES
2609-156975-0020 FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND G C
2609-156975-0021 AT THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
2609-156975-0022 THESE SAME WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KIDOM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHEN HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN THAT TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0024 THIS SCORE OF THE WEARINESS
2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSE A PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUETTE
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIEST OF THE SUBTRIBE OF THE KINNITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOUSE AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0027 NOTICE THE CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL IDEA OF MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS THE LEADER AND DELIVERER OF THE PEOPLE
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAINLY OF THEM WENT UP WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KINITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAMWAY OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GUIDE WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0031 DO THE EARLIEST SEA BREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0032 THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST'S MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0033 MOSES OF THE HOME OF THE MIDIAN PRIESTS WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0034 THE CRUEL STATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
2609-156975-0035 HIS QUEST WAS FOR A JUTS AND STRONG GOWN ABLE TO DEVOUR THE OPPRESSED
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENS THE SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON A POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST ANTONAEAN PLAIN OF CENTRAL ASIA MINOR SYRIL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVEN SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
2609-156975-0038 THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESSES AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES'S CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTION
2609-157645-0000 EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION IS TO MAKE THINGS PRESENT FOR THE ROYAL FOE OF TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
2609-157645-0001 THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGUISING QUOD AT A SMOAN IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
2609-157645-0002 SOMETIMES TOBACCO IS USED IN CHURCH FOR DISINFECTANT OR DEORIDIZING PURPOSES
2609-157645-0003 BLACKBURN ART'S BISSIP OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER
2609-157645-0004 ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH DININGHAM FOR A CONFIRMER MASON
2609-157645-0005 ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER DIZNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTRY AT HATTON
2609-157645-0006 PAUL WAS SUCH A CONTINUOUS SMOKER THAT ANYONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HADN'T NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF A PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENCE
2609-157645-0007 ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITSFIELD HE HANDED MASTER PIPE AND CHASTLEER THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING EM PATIENT
2609-157645-0008 THEM HAVE THEM SING ANOTHER PSALM SAID THE CURATE
2609-157645-0009 THERE HAVE SIR REPLIED THE CLERK
2609-157645-0010 THEN LET THEM SING THE HUNDRED AND NINETEENTHS REPLIED THE CURATE
2609-157645-0011 SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AS MANY TOBACCO PIPES AS TO THE MAN OF OFFICES
2609-157645-0012 DAVID DEANE SAVOR DENIED OUT AWE PROVED THIS IRREVERENCE
2609-157645-0013 GOING TO CHURCH SAINT HAINE'S IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN A QUAINT IN THE SIGNING EXPERIENCE
2609-157645-0014 WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOMS THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
2609-169640-0000 PARROTS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY THE SCEPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE SEA'S FOUR OF THEM FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE
2609-169640-0001 AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JUST KEPT STEERAGE WAY OF THE SHIP
2609-169640-0002 FORTUNATELY THE JOHN WAS NOT ONLY FAT BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS THE LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS TO UNLIVELY DANCE
2609-169640-0003 I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SIP PO'S HE SPECTS EE IN MODERATE WEATHER
2609-169640-0004 MISTER MARVEL HE I DO B'LIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HINCOOPS BEIN LIKE THE SAILORS AS ONE MIGHT SAY FERRY ASLEEP
2609-169640-0005 AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE WITHIN FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN THE BOAT
2609-169640-0006 I SING OUT SAIL HO AND CLOSE ONBOARD
2609-169640-0007 HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT HAD TO BE DONE
2609-169640-0008 ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET TO OR TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
2609-169640-0009 AS OUR SEATS WERE ALL FLYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME A LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT
2609-169640-0010 I SOON SAW BOTH PONTZ AND GREAT ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER
2609-169640-0011 MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS ANSWER AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCAL'S ABACK
2609-169640-0012 A BREAKFAST STILLNESS SUCCEEDED
2609-169640-0013 THE PROWARDS DID NOT ALTER THEIR COURSE BUT NEARED US FAST
2609-169640-0014 I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING PIPES TOO AS THEY WERE CAST ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
2609-169640-0015 KAVE WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
2609-169640-0016 THE STILLNESS THAT REIGNED ON BOTH SIDES SEEMED LIKE THAT OF DEATH
2609-169640-0017 THE GIANT BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY AND CAME ROUND LIKE A DART
2609-169640-0018 THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER WE COULD PASS THEM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GET NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
2609-169640-0019 THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INCIDENT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE IN THE CLOSEST DISTANCE TO HIS ORDERS
2609-169640-0020 NOT A SOUL ON BOARD A JOHN WAS HURT
2609-169640-0021 ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMEN THE FOUR SIXES TWO AT THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERNMOST PROW A WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
2609-169640-0022 THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS WITH ANGUISH
2609-169640-0023 I DOUBT IF WE'D TOUCH THE MAN IN THE NEAREST PARALLEL
2609-169640-0024 IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD OF HER CANVAS'S BINNED FORE LEAVING THE POORER MOSTCENOUS IN THE WAKE
3005-163389-0000 THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHIRBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK ABOUT THE NOISE
3005-163389-0001 SOME SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEARING DOWN THE FENCE
3005-163389-0002 THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY AND UNHAPPY
3005-163389-0003 SHERBURN RAN HIS EYE SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUTGAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
3005-163389-0004 AN AVERAGE MAN'S A COWARD
3005-163389-0005 BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE MAN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARK AND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY COULD DO
3005-163389-0006 SO WE ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH A HUNDRED MASKED COWARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
3005-163389-0007 YOU DIDN'T WANT TO COME IN
3005-163389-0008 BUT A MOB WITHOUT ANY MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT IS BENEATH PITIFULNESS AND
3005-163389-0009 THEN LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN UP ACROSS HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS THIS
3005-163389-0010 THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AND THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AND JACK HARKNESS HE HEALED IT AFTER THEM LOOKING INTOLERABLE CHEAP
3005-163389-0011 HERE CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
3005-163389-0012 THEY ARGUED AND TRIED TO KEEP HIM OUT BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE WHOLE SHOW COMED TO A STANDSTILL
3005-163389-0013 THAT ONE OR TWO WOMEN BEGAN TO SCREAM
3005-163389-0014 SO THEN THE RING MASTER HAD MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSE
3005-163389-0015 IT WARN'T FUNNY TO ME IF I WAS ALL OF A TREMBLE TO SEE HIS DANGER
3005-163389-0016 AND THE HORSE A GOING LIKE A HOUSE A FIRE TOO
3005-163389-0017 HE SHED THEM SO THICK THEY KIND OF CLOGGED UP THE AIR AND ALTOGETHER HE SHED SEVENTEEN SORTS
3005-163389-0018 I IT WAS ONE OF HIS OWN MEN
3005-163390-0000 AND BUT NEVER MIND THE REST OF HIS OUTFIT IT WAS JIST WILD AND IT WAS AWFUL FUNNY
3005-163390-0001 THE PEOPLE MOST KILLED THEMSELVES LAUGHING AND WHEN A KING GOT DONE CAPERING AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HAWED TILL HE COME BACK AND DONE IT OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM DO IT ANOTHER TIME
3005-163390-0002 AND TWENTY PEOPLE SINGS OUT

3005-163391-0018 BLAMED IF HE DIDN'T ENQUIRE ABOUT EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN THAT BLESSED TOWN AND ALL ABOUT THE WILKES'S AND ABOUT PETER'S BUSINESS WHICH WAS A TANNER AND ABOUT GEORGE'S WHICH WAS A CARPENTER AND ABOUT HARVEY'S WHICH WAS A DISSENTERING MINISTER AND SO ON AND SO ON THEN HE SAYS

3005-163391-0022 NOW HUSTLE BACK RIGHT OFF AND FETCH THE DUKE UP HERE AND THE OLD CARPET BAGS

3005-163391-0026 THEN ONE OF THEM IS KIND OF SOFT AND GENTLE
3005-163399-0000 PHELPS WAS ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONE HORSE COTTON PLANTATIONS AND THEY ALL LOOK A LIKE
3005-163399-0001 I WENT ACROSS AND CLIMBED OVER THE BACK STILE BY THE ASHHOPPER AND STARTED FOR THE KITCHEN
3005-163399-0002 AY OUT WID A YAS'M FORE I THOUGHT
3005-163399-0003 SO THEN SHE STARTED FOR THAT HOUSE LEADING ME BY THE HAND AND THE CHILDREN TAGGING AFTER

3005-163399-0012 I HAD MY MIND ON THE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME I WANTED TO GET THEM OUT OF ONE SIDE AND PUMP THEM A LITTLE AND FIND OUT WHO I WAS
3005-163399-0013 PRETTY SOON SHE MADE THE COLD CHILL STREAM ALL DOWN MY BACK BECAUSE SHE SAYS
3005-163399-0014 I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEAD I'T GOT TO THROW UP MY HAND
3005-163399-0015 SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I GOT TO WRESK THE TRUTH
3005-163399-0016 I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE SHE COMES
3005-163399-0017 CHILDREN DON'T DO SAY A WORD
3005-163399-0018 I HEAR I WAS IN A FIX NOW
3005-163399-0019 MISSUS PHELPS SHE JUMPS FOR HER AND SAYS
3005-163399-0020 HAS YOU COME NO SAYS HER HUSBAND
3005-163399-0021 I CAN'T IMAGINE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MIGHT SAY IT MAKES ME DREADFUL UNEASY
3005-163399-0022 UNEASY SHE SAYS I I'M READY TO GO DISTRACTED
3005-163399-0023 HE MUST HA COME AND YOU'VE MISSED HIM ALONG THE ROAD
3005-163399-0024 OH DON'T DISTRESS ME ANY MORE'N I'M ALREADY DISTRESST
3005-163399-0025 WHY SILAS LOOK YONDER UP THE ROAD AIN'T THAT SOMEBODY COMEIN
3005-163399-0026 THE OLD GENTLEMAN STARED AND AS
3005-163399-0027 I HAIN'T NO IDEA WHO IS IS IT
3005-163399-0028 THERE IS TOM SAWYER
3005-163399-0029 BING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AN COMFORTABLE AN IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
3005-163399-0030 THEN I SAID TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SAWYER COMES DOWN ON THE BOAT
3080-5032-0000 BUT I AM HUGELY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ME LADY
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN BUT THE WORST OF
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUMOUR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR
3080-5032-0003 WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND YOUR GARLAND
3080-5032-0004 WELL THE BEST ON'T IS THAT I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS THE KNIGHT
3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH A OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGEST
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN ON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITH ALL AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS AS IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
3080-5032-0008 TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AN I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS A SQUIRE OF DRANE'S AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND TO SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0010 I KNOW MY YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH HIM
3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUT THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY THAT I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK ANXIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAVE HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR DAUGHTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0014 BUT AND BESIDES I CAN GIVE YOU OTHERS
3080-5032-0015 I AM THERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0016 YOU WILL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN THAT HE WAS
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH ME I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY ESCAPE IT
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMOURS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITH WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBOURS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GRAVE FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU SHE SHOULD HAVE IT
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU CANNOT
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY FRIEND COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE BUT MUCH MORE SOLEMNLY
3080-5032-0024 AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I WRITTEN IT SINCE
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM CHEEK MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE BUT I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETERS
3080-5032-0026 HOW KINDLY DO I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHERS IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE WHY HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
3080-5040-0000 WOULD IT WOULD BELIEVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AN DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS WERE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMASH
3080-5040-0003 I WONDER HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHILE SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE EITHER BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDES IN A PUBLIC WEDDING TO BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL FOR IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WOULD NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTERS TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
3080-5040-0008 MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGONE THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF THE SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED

3080-5040-0014 INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS COMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND AM ABLE TO JUDGE FOR A MOST EXCELLENT SERVANT AND FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE
3080-5040-0015 BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
3080-5040-0016 I DO NOT SEE IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVED ME
3080-5040-0017 YET I AM CALLED UPON
3080-5040-0018 I DIRECTED FOR YOUR MASTER
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHID WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE OF ME
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIVE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS THAN THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING IT
3080-5040-0021 YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE AFTER THIS THAT I ESCAPE DROWNING
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WROTE BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS IN MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0023 HOW WELCOME YOU MIGHT BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DISGUISE AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGHED TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS WOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS IF WE HAVE TIME
3080-5040-0027 WHILE IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THAT KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
3080-5040-0028 WILL YOU BE SO GOOD NATURED TOO
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND TAKES THE FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THUS WITH DISCOURSES OF THE FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM WHENCE
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER OCCASION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAS LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OF HER AIM
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE THEM AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THAT ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASE CART WITH NINE PEAS IN IT UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PATAL INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
3331-159605-0001 THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MORE CREDIT I
3331-159605-0002 I'VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF TO NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE WHAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES
3331-159605-0004 WHAT A FATEFUL THING I AM
3331-159605-0005 I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME WHY I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
3331-159605-0006 LET YOU SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN
3331-159605-0007 HE HAD KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAD A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS WHICH USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN HE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE OR FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 IT HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLATTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WILL CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON TO WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
3331-159605-0014 POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SIDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THEIR LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED BILLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BACKY AND BESS BUT COULD NOT RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR ANNE THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DOG BUT YOU SEE POLLY IS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASSA CHARLIE'S HAND MISS MAMMIE AND WALK PRETTY LIKE BILLY AND FLOSSIE SAID THE MATE
3331-159605-0019 AT THE STREET CORNERS A BLACK EYED SCHOOLBOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE WAS FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST AS SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE ROTHS ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRANKNESS WAS SO AMIABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FORDS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSES AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0025 THANK YOU TOO
3331-159605-0026 HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE ASKED IN GREAT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP TO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS RESOLVED TO SETTLE THAT MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
3331-159605-0029 SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BUOYANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED WITH ME ANNOYED
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WILD LIKE LEVERLI
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE BUT SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVOURITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFTTOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0033 WORKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL AND'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS SHE'LL CHILL
3331-159605-0035 UTTERLY DONE UP AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0036 MINNIE SAYS THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PODDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RABBITS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS NOT HE PROPOSED IT
3331-159605-0038 BUT DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO
3331-159605-0039 TRULY JULIE FANE
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DOES
3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY TO IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
3331-159605-0042 THEY JUST GAVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO I THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT SIDDY TATTLER SAY
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A CHANGLAMAN MADE NO FUSS
3331-159605-0045 BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GLAD THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0046 I'M ODD YOU KNOW AND OUGHT TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO AWAKEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR A ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS COULD NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE DAYS
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THOSE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKED TO HEAR
3331-159609-0005 NO I' AM ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME I CAN
3331-159609-0007 I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0008 THANK HIM FOR THAT
3331-159609-0009 CRIED POLLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER EYES
3331-159609-0010 POOR POLLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAS NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELL TALE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKINGLY HAD I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BETTER
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENSE OF HER OWN LOVER IN ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATED THEIR RESPECTIVE VERS WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARION BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0016 SAID MAGGIE TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO JOHN JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BAD THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED ON HER
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINTER FROM THIS LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SIDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE A HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THE CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OF A BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHOWS
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER BUT THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT HER IN UTTER DARKNESS
3331-159609-0024 FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOYS THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORKBASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE REAL AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
3528-168656-0000 I HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO WRITE IN THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR THAT SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSCEBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOLGIRL WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MASTERS FROWN
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH BROKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF FONTRAVAL DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0006 SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HIS OBJECT TO ANYONE
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF MOMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENT
3528-168656-0008 SOME UNIQUE CHAPLET SOME AUTHENTIC RELIC OF
3528-168656-0009 THEY PLACED THEMSELVES IN CONJECTURES
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO THEIR CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT THE DANCER IS FLYING WITH A SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0012 MORAL LOVE COMFORTED BY THE COLIC
3528-168669-0000 THE PRIORESS RETURNED AND SEATED HIMSELF ONCE MORE ON HER CHAIR
3528-168669-0001 WE WILL PRESENT A STANOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0002 FATHER FAUXENT
3528-168669-0003 A REVEREND MOTHER DO YOU KNOW THE CHAPEL
3528-168669-0004 AND YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIME
3528-168669-0005 THERE IS A STONE TO BE RAISED VERY
3528-168669-0006 WAS THE SLAP OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0007 ON THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT YES
3528-168669-0008 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE THREE MEN FOR IT
3528-168669-0009 A GIRL IS NEVER A MAN
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DAM BABYLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MERLINUS HORSES ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MERLANUS HORSES NEITHER DO I
3528-168669-0011 MERIT CONSISTS IN THINKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCKYARD
3528-168669-0012 BUT A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0013 AN CAN YOU GET A LEVER
3528-168669-0014 THERE IS A RING WITH THE STONE
3528-168669-0015 I WILL TAKE THE LEVER THROUGH IT
3528-168669-0016 THAT IS A GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I WILL OPEN THE VAULT
3528-168669-0017 WILL THAT BE SO NO
3528-168669-0018 GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS VERY REVEREND WOMAN
3528-168669-0019 FAAUVENT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
3528-168669-0020 I AM HERE TO DO THINGS YOU WISH
3528-168669-0021 AND TO HOLD YOUR PEACE ABOUT EVERY THING YES HEAVEN MOTHER
3528-168669-0022 WHEN THE WORLD IS OPEN I WILL CLOSE IT AGAIN
3528-168669-0023 BUT BEFORE THAT WHAT REVEREND MOTHERS
3528-168669-0024 FATHER FLOUVIN REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0025 YOU KNOW THAT A WIFE DIED THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0026 NO DID I NOT HEAR THE BELL
3528-168669-0027 NOTHING CAN BE HEARD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDENS REALLY
3528-168669-0028 AND THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN THEIR DIRECTION THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0029 IT WAS MISTER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN MEN CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER AH
3528-168669-0031 THEY MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW
3528-168669-0032 A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOMS MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0033 HE GOT MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0034 WHAT DO THEY SAY
3528-168669-0035 I SAYS MORE OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT
3528-168669-0036 REVEREND MARY I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT I SAID MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0037 BUT THEY DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0038 AT THAT MOMENT NINE O'CLOCK STRUCK ONE
3528-168669-0039 AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT ALL HOURS PRAISED AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR SAID THE PRURESS
3528-168669-0040 IT CUT MORE ALMOST SHORT
3528-168669-0041 FAUCHELEVENT MOPPED THE FOREHEAD
3528-168669-0042 IN HER LIFETIME MOTHER CRUCIFIXION MADE CONVERTS AFTER HER DEATH SHE WILL REFORM MIRACLES SHE WILL
3528-168669-0043 FATHER HAUVIN THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0044 SHE RESTRAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT
3528-168669-0045 SHE GAVE THIS HER LAST COMMANDS
3528-168669-0046 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HERCEL SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0047 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT LETTER
3528-168669-0048 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORISON WITH WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING
3528-168669-0049 FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE BUT WENT ON
3528-168669-0050 I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABORING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUITS
3528-168669-0051 FORTUNATELY THE PRIORESS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR THEM
3528-168669-0052 SHE CONTINUED FATHER FERVEN
3528-168669-0053 YES REVEREND MARGARET
3528-168669-0054 SAINT TERENTIUS BISHOP OF PORT WHERE THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER EMPTIES INTO THE SEA REQUESTED THAT ON HIS TOMB MIGHT BE ENGRAVED THE SIGN WHICH WAS PLACED ON THE GRAVES OF PARASITES IN THE HOPE THAT PASSERS BY WOULD SPIT UPON HIS TOMB THIS WAS DONE

3528-168669-0068 THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED TO BE BURIED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL NOT TO GO TO PROFANE EARTH TO REMAIN THERE IN DEATH WHICH SHE PRAYED WHILE LIVING SUCH WAS THE LAST WISH OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0069 SHE ASK IT OF US THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDED US
3528-168669-0070 BUT IT IS FORBIDDEN IT
3528-168669-0071 YOU I AM A STONE IN YOUR WALLS

3528-168669-0130 I WILL MAKE THAT MY PERSONAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT AND DISHES
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENCE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED TO BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THOSE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THIS LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THAT SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN THE SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANES
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN NINETY
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WOULD THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010 A REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP SHOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN A STOVE OR OVEN OR A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON TIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTE ARE OF THE SAME CHARACTER AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THERE PRESERVES OF A HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN OH THREE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHERE THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN OR EIGHT
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFECTION TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER AND THEY WILL NOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED TO FANCIFUL DESSERTS
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON THE STEMS
3538-142836-0023 OF ISIS
3538-142836-0024 AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES HAD SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025 THE SPATTLE IS USUALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWERS WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT IN THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FAR WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003 KISS THE GIRL SAID THE HEAD
3538-163619-0004 AND WHEN THE COUNT ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005 THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET OUT FROM THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006 AT LENGTH THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET TO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY BROTHER SEEING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE HOUSE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010 SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON THEE UGLY FISHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEY NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THIS GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SAVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FALLS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LADIES CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT I HAVE HAD SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD COME OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005 THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME COMPLIMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT OF THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTIFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007 COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME COUSIN AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHEN THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN A CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE STOOD WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SYD A LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDER LAD SET OUT UPON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID SINDER LADS
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID SINDO LAD
3538-163622-0014 AND SO THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL AGAIN ASKED DIDST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING IT IS WHITE SAID SINDER LAD
3538-163622-0017 HE LOOKS LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018 SINDOLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHY WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE PHAL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED THE BULL SEEST THOU NOTHING
3538-163622-0022 KNOW THEN SAID THE FOAL DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT'S A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDALAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS YOUNG
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD PRINCE WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME DOWN AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
3538-163624-0003 SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOUR ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THEIR HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN TWO DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT TO HIM
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT THAT THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008 SO REGAN MAKE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS SON AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN
3538-163624-0010 SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD COULD DO
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ACROSS AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THREW THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0013 SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF THAT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN THEM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0015 DIE THOU FAFNER AND THEN STAFNER DIED
3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFFNA'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0017 SO SIGURD PUT THE THOUGHT OF FAFNER ON A STEAK AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0018 THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE WOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HIYNFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU CAMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST WONDERFUL LADY
3538-163624-0022 THEN SIGURD RAN AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0023 LIN BRENHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAMES IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUNDRAN WERE BATHING BRUNHELD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRAN'S SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0025 BUT HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT SHE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
367-130732-0000 LOBSTERS AND LOBSTERS TOO
367-130732-0001 WHEN IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER WHILE IT IS A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION IN ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMARY OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME INTO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOUR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE NOTHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN
367-130732-0004 A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN ALL SHOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT THE MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD WIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER ALE NEUBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DOMONICO

367-130732-0012 I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COAST IT IS PREPARED SOMEWHERE SO DELICIOUSLY AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
367-130732-0013 GOBY'S FACE WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBRIES OF BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PRESTIGE DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
367-130732-0015 GOBYE'S CRAB STEW
367-130732-0016 MAKE THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT ALL THE FAT FROM THE SHELL

367-130732-0022 SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE HOLLBROW HAS BEEN MAKING A SPECIALITY OF THEM
367-130732-0023 ALL THE BETTER CLASS RESTAURANTS HOWEVER WILL SERVE THEM IF YOU OFFER THEM
367-130732-0024 THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR EIGHT PEOPLE AND IT IS WELL WORTH TRYING IF WE ARE GIVING A DINNER OF IMPORTANCE

367-293981-0010 SANCHO GOT UP WITH PAIN ENOUGH IN HIS BONES AND WENT AFTER THE INNKEEPER IN THE DARK AND MEETING THE OFFICER WHO WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIS ENEMY HE SAID TO HIM SENOR WHOEVER YOU ARE DO US THE FAVOR AND KINDNESS TO GIVE US A LITTLE ROSEMARY OIL SALT AND WINE FOR IT IS WONTED TO CURE ONE OF OUR BEST KNIGHTS ERRANT ON EARTH WHO LIES ON YONDER BED WOUNDED BY THE HAND OF THE ENCHANTED MOOR THAT IS IN THIS INN
367-293981-0011 TO BE BRIEF HE TOOK THE MATERIALS OF WHICH HE MADE A COMPOUND MIXING THEM ALL AND BOILING THEM A GOOD WHILE IT UNTIL IT SEEMED TO THEM THEY HAD COME TO PERFECTION
367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE PISTON WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED IT DOWN AND DRAINED UP VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER
367-293981-0014 IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT RETURNED SANCHO WOE BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KINDRED WHY DID YOU LET ME TASTE THAT
367-293981-0015 SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THIS KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU IN THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOU SATISFACTION AND REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRE
367-293981-0016 YET THIS IS AN INN SAID DON QUIXOTE
367-293981-0017 AS A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE SAID THE INNKEEPER
367-293981-0018 THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLANKETED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW IDEA WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS SQUIRE WHO UTTERED THEM
367-293981-0019 THEY SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
367-293981-0020 SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK IT NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THAT BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
3764-168670-0000 THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLIN GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
3764-168670-0001 COSETTE WHO HAD WAKED UP
3764-168670-0002 JEAN VALJEAN HAD RAISED HER NEAR THE FIRE
3764-168670-0003 YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT THAT LADY'S HOUSE I SHALL COME TO FETCH YOU
3764-168670-0004 EVERYTHING IS RANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
3764-168670-0005 I HAVE PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE CALLED OUT
3764-168670-0006 THAT'S WHERE THAT DIFFICULTY LIES
3764-168670-0007 IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH HER CHILD YOU WILL CARRY HER OUT
3764-168670-0008 AND SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE I ANSWERS FOR THAT
3764-168670-0009 FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED OUT MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN VALJEAN
3764-168670-0010 YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELEINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE YOU
3764-168670-0011 JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RAVENNA
3764-168670-0012 FAUCHELEVENT WENT ON HE
3764-168670-0013 IT IS TO MORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU INTO THE PRIORESS EXPECTS YOU
3764-168670-0014 THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR A SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE UNION
3764-168670-0015 IT THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
3764-168670-0016 THAT THE PRAYERESS AND THE VOCAL MOTHERS INTENDED TO FULFIL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
3764-168670-0017 THEN HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THE CELL RAISE THE STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
3764-168670-0018 AND THEN THAT THERE IS ANOTHER THE EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0019 WHAT IS THAT UGLY COFFIN
3764-168670-0020 THEN ASKED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
3764-168670-0021 WHAT COFFIN WHAT ADMINISTRATION IS
3764-168670-0022 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER HIS CHAIR DO
3764-168670-0023 YOU KNOW FAUCHELEVENT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID MOTHER THE CRUCIFIXION IS DEAD
3764-168670-0024 AND I ADD AND FATHER MADELEINE WAS BURIED R
3764-168670-0025 YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN FATHER MADELEINES
3764-168670-0026 THIS OFFERS THE MEANS GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
3764-168670-0027 HOW LONG IS THE COFFIN SIX PEOPLE
3764-168670-0028 IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH WHEN CHURCH
3764-168670-0029 THE CHURCH IN THE STREET BUT THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
3764-168670-0030 HAVE YOU A KEYS TO THOSE TWO DOORS
3764-168670-0031 NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY OF THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKERS THEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET THE COFFIN
3764-168670-0033 WHO NAILS UP THE COFFIN AND DO
3764-168670-0034 WHO SPREADS THE PAD OVER IT
3764-168670-0035 NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER A DEAD ROOM THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
3764-168670-0036 COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THAT ROOM TO NIGHT WHERE EVERY ONE IS ASLEEP
3764-168670-0037 ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THE
3764-168670-0038 I SHALL BE HUNGRY IF I WILL BRING YOU SOMETHING
3764-168670-0039 YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP IN THE COFFIN AT EIGHT O'CLOCK
3764-168670-0040 FAUCHELEVENT RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS HEAD JOINTS BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
3764-168670-0041 BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS THROUGH A PLANK
3764-168670-0042 JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAITS FROM THIS
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE SCALE
3764-168670-0044 WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF THAT CURE
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY HAUNTS
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK ON LOOSELY AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0047 A MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEGE
3764-168670-0048 WHO IS THERE WHO IS NOT SAID TO A CAT DO COME IN
3764-168670-0049 THE OVERPRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THERE ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
3764-168670-0050 BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COOL CALMNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU ARE CERTAIN OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
3764-168670-0052 AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE BUT I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0053 I SHALL HOLD THAT IS MY BUSINESS
3764-168670-0054 THE HOUSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN NOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0055 THE PRIEST SAYS MY PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SO
3764-168670-0057 THAT IS SETTLED FATHER FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL DO WELL
3764-168671-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAIN PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND HEADS
3764-168671-0001 THAT HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
3764-168671-0002 A MORNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED IT
3764-168671-0003 BEHIND THIS CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABOURER WHO LIMPED ALONG
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING AND SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN A CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES IN THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES
3764-168671-0006 DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT THAT FLOWERS WERE DESERTING IT
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VOUGERINS IT HINTED AT POVERTY PER LA CHAISE IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PERE LA CHAISE IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING A FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0009 THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN INTO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN EFFECTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENSE IN OUR SIGHT
3764-168671-0010 IT IS ONE OF THE PLANTS WHICH RESEMBLE A DUTY
3764-168671-0011 THE NUNS HAD COMMITTED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN COUNTENANCES
3764-168671-0012 IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE THAT IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0013 MAKE AS MANY WALLS AS YOU PLEASE MEN BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES
3764-168671-0014 A PRINCESS IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPLE
3764-168671-0015 FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTING FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0016 JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE PITIFUL TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0017 WHAT REMAINED REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESHEN
3764-168671-0019 HE DO WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
3764-168671-0020 THE PERMISSION FOR INTERMENT SHOULD BE EXHIBITED
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED HIS MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0022 THE MAN REPLIED THE GRAVEDIGER
3764-168671-0023 THE GRAVE DIGGER IS
3764-168671-0024 YOU I YOU
3764-168671-0025 FATHER MESTINDNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
3764-168671-0026 FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS BUT A GRAVE DIGGER MUST DIE
3764-168671-0027 IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIGGERS CANNOT DIE THEMSELVES
3764-168671-0028 HE HAD HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STAMMER OH
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER MESTIEN IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER ELNOIR IS HERE'S A JUG OF RED WINE
3764-168671-0031 BUT YOU'RE A JOLLY FELLOW NOW
3764-168671-0032 ARE YOU THE COMRADE WE'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENTLY
3764-168671-0033 THE MAN I REPLIED
3764-168671-0034 IT LIMPED MORE OUT OF ANXIETY THAN FROM INFIRMITY
3764-168671-0035 THE GRAVE DIGGER WALKED OUT IN FRONT OF HIM
3764-168671-0036 FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED GRIVLIER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A MISERABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER HE MUTTERED
3764-168671-0038 MY SIR FATHER MATHIER IS DEAD
3764-168671-0039 THE MAN REPLIED COLDLY
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTEBOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MESSIANNE'S TURN FATHER MESTHIERNE DIED
3764-168671-0041 STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT IT IS MADE OF
3764-168671-0042 YOU ARE A PIRATE I AM A PARISIAN
3764-168671-0043 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT I AND LOST
3764-168671-0044 THERE WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTINCT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUNS CORNER
3764-168671-0045 AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNED A PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS WHITE AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE CORTINNIUM TOWN HALL
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES TO CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0049 SO YOU ARE NOW A GRAVE DIGGER THEN
3764-168671-0050 RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS WAS
3764-168671-0051 HERE A REMARK BECOME NECESSARY
3764-168671-0052 FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH CAUSED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053 BUT THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE
3764-168671-0054 BUT ONE MUST EAT
3997-180294-0000 THE DOG COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR NOTHING WHAT
3997-180294-0002 WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THOSE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR NOW
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO IT
3997-180294-0005 YOU GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF A HAPPIER
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING A SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COURSE OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST IN LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL HIS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VEIL
3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BATTLE HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
3997-180294-0011 THEY HAVE BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE WITH A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0013 THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF THEY GIVE
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABOURERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAS SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0015 THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOOK SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSE TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAISIN
3997-180294-0018 WHEN I HAD REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAIETY
3997-180294-0019 THAT WOMAN BECOMES A MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0020 WHERE WHY
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST DAY
3997-180294-0022 WHERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT THE VAUDEVILLE
3997-180294-0023 COME DURING THE THIRD ET TRACT
3997-180294-0024 THE BOXES FULL ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY HIS STAGE BOX
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FOURTH ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0027 DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LIVED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING IT ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0029 YOU SHOULD GO TO BED SHE CRIED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0030 WHO AT HOME
3997-180294-0031 DO YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK
3997-180294-0032 BECAUSE SHE DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
3997-180294-0033 NONE THE LESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY GLADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0000 I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDERS YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
3997-180297-0001 YOU'RE IN THE WAY MARGUERITE AND HOW
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE GOT A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE
3997-180297-0003 DURING THIS REMARKS MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY
3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU DO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME BY SAYING NO
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM WATCH AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
3997-180297-0007 IS THAT ONLY THE ONLY REASON
3997-180297-0008 IF THERE WERE NO OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
3997-180297-0009 HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE ONE GREAT DEAL
3997-180297-0010 I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS OF SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0011 WELL GOOD HEAVEN'S THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
3997-180297-0012 I TURNED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRES HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FARTHER
3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIGNS AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND IN RUINING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016 WE NO LONGER BELONGT TO OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017 WE STAND FIRST IN HER SELF ESTEEM LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER DO THEY GIVE US ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGES FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE'S OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0021 I FELT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH HE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVED I KNEW WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION DREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0024 MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW YOU WOULD KILL ME
3997-180297-0025 MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID I
3997-180297-0026 HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT UP
3997-180297-0027 I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND WHICH GAVE IT ME
3997-180297-0028 LOOK HERE PRUDENCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID VIRGINIA
3997-180297-0029 HE WANTS YOU TO FULFIL HIM
3997-180297-0030 ONE HAS TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT THAT THEN
3997-180297-0031 I EMBRACED MARGUERITE UNTIL SHE WAS ALMOST STIFLED AND
3997-182399-0000 OLD MISTER BUZZARD GRINNING
3997-182399-0001 THIS SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER STONE

4198-12281-0005 LORD GOD DAMME HE POTEM
4198-12281-0006 LET HIM BE CARRIED TO PRISON FOR TROUBLING THE DIVINE JUSTICE
4198-12281-0007 WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN THE ADVENT AND OF THE WINTER
4198-12281-0008 HARK YOU MY MASTERS YOU THAT LOVE THE WINE COP'S BODY FOLLOW ME FOR SAINT ANTHONY BURN ME AS FREELY AS A FAGGOT THEY GET LEAVE TO TASTE ONE DROP OF THE LIQUEUR THAT WILL NOT NOW COME AND FIGHT FOR RELIEF OF THE WINE
4198-12281-0009 TO OTHERS AGAIN HE UNJOINTED THE SPINDELLS OR KNUCKLES OF THE NECK DISFIGURED THEIR CHAPS GHASHED THEIR FACES MADE THEIR CHEEKS HANG FLAPPING ON THEIR CHIN AND SO SWINGED AND BELAMMED THEM THAT THEY FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM LIKE HAY BEFORE HIM ALL
4198-12281-0010 TO SOME WITH THEIR SMART SOUS ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THE MIDRIFTS WAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOME PUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
4198-12281-0011 BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE SPECTACLE THAT EVER MAN SAW
4198-12281-0012 OH THE HOLY LADY NITIS SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTUS O OUR LADY OF SUCCOURS SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP
4198-12281-0013 SOME DIED WITHOUT SPEAKING OTHERS DIED WITHOUT DYING SOME DIED IN SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE IN DYING
4198-12281-0014 CAN YOU TELL WITH WHAT INSTRUMENTS THEY HAD IT
4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEAN TIME FRIAR JOHN WITH THIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVORED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF USHER BY THE ADHERENCE OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0001 AT THIS BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SHAD DURUS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
4198-61336-0003 TIGLATH PELISER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE EURENTIAN ARMY IN CUMAK
4198-61336-0004 THE FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF ITS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING SUDORUS WHO LEAPT FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST YORUTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0007 THE SIFTI MATTI ILIU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT CHARDORAS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0008 TIGLATH THE BELIZER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERN FRONT WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0010 ARPAD WAS CAPTURED AND MATTH ILIU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE BISHOPS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ASSYRIA
4198-61336-0012 ITS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF AFFAIRS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0013 JEHO AS THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARD HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHELLAM
4198-61336-0015 THIS USURPER HELD SWAY AT SUMERIA FOR ONLY A MOMENT
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MENNHEIM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0017 TEGLATH PALLISER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTHEAST
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE WAS NOT PUT TO THE SWARD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS URRITU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLATH PELLIZER RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0021 MINUHEIM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PAGAHIAH
4198-61336-0022 JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS AND ISRAEL TO ASSERT ITS INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0023 HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FROM ITS IDOLATRIES AND CRIED
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YE ME AND YE SHALL LIVE HAVE YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS THIRTY YEARS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL
4198-61336-0025 THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES SHALL NOT PERISH
4198-61336-0026 ISRAELS WAS ALSO DEALT WITH
4198-61336-0027 HE SWUNG THROUGH ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0028 THE PHILISTINES AND THE ARABIANS OF A DESERT WERE ALSO SUBDUED
4198-61336-0029 HE INVADED BABY BABYLONIA
4198-61336-0030 UGENZER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITOL SAPPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0000 AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WISHED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND PLAIN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAD ARRANGED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME ERROR
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME MY LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BENNIELO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR IF HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0005 I ASK NO GREATER REWARD FOR MY LABORS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORKS
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FAVORS TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0008 I BEGGED HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SIMPLE PERSON WHOM I HAD EVER TAKEN IN
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GEORGIO DELLA CORTONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0010 GIORGIO CAME FOR THEM HIS WEALTH
4294-14317-0011 I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGUISE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIOLANDI WITH HIM
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARCHELLO
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH WERE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTOR'S CRAFT
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THAT PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-14317-0016 AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE LITTLE SCULPTOR
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS IN THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN HEART I LEFT MY HOME
4294-32859-0000 WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDILY
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LACE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDALINE AND RETCH'S PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I TELL YOU THE STORY
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLES AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLE
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE LINE WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY AND FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE GOES
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN'S SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WOMAN CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET OR JANGLING
4294-35475-0005 I COULD BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRIED HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO IMPATIENT TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY I CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST REND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH LIMBY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THAT OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT IN SAVE US FROM THE OGRE'S MIGHT
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FOOT COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO KEEP THEE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GIVE THE FLY ITS FREEDOM
4294-35475-0015 THE FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEY HOLE
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING MORNING UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS A SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH AN OPENING
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING ROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE AND CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF THEM CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MIGHT WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGHBORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND KINGS TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0025 BUT ETHELRIT HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-35475-0026 SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE VIOULT
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT BUT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
4294-9934-0001 HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FANCY MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND THAT HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOUL
4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS QUICK EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINS HIM
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FIRST
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM A FATHER
4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE APPREHENSIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS MATTERS OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0010 BUT THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY
4294-9934-0011 REQUESTING COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012 OR WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAC
4294-9934-0013 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW YET
4294-9934-0014 SILVER GOLD WHERE IT IS
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN BE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS
4294-9934-0016 THAT COULD BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0017 OH IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0018 DO YOU KNOW GERMAN YOU NO
4294-9934-0019 IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT I CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0020 THE CLOTHESES DEALER WAS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0021 HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR HIS CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S
4294-9934-0022 HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE POUNDS
4294-9934-0023 HELLO I HAS FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0024 THE LANDLORD DIRECTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0025 I HAVE TEN MINUTES LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0026 THEY WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SEVEN HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE TWENTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0029 AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FINGERS LEFT
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE WIFE
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE STOPPED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISAPPOINTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY
4350-10919-0003 WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR TALE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPES SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0005 AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH THE SIGH
4350-10919-0006 THE VERY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS OF MALUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS DISEASE WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
4350-10919-0009 YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCED AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE YASKI BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON
4350-10919-0011 WHO ASKED AH IT IS
4350-10919-0012 OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN THREE MINUTES
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW AFTER A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH IN LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0015 OF THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS AND REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES
4350-10919-0017 AND NOW THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE A MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019 OH TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO A DOOR
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PAGE ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DATES PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT THROUGH THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AS HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024 WE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME MOTHER BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS'S THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRATED GOD DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAYS TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THEIR DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ASHORE THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN HIS NEED
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DARK HAD GONE
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND ELSIE PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARFUL
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING ORDER
4350-9170-0001 BUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTEREST OF THE GROUPS
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES AND
4350-9170-0005 THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY EXISTENCE
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON OR SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THAT ARMY
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWERS
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT WAS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010 INDEED INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSITION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS WE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF A STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLING AND CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF THE LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0017 FOR THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DYSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE DEPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONGRESS
4350-9170-0022 SO IT HAS REALLY BEEN
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THAT POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON SINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUIDES AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER ORDERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE EYE
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF HIS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY TO ITS NEIGHBOUR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THAT INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE OF THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH A STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO A NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THAT MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN PERSONAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORIUM OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF BUSINESS ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS IN OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBOURS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE PARTY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE'S SOCIAL LIFE MEAN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS A MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE WAS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRACTICALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MADE THEM
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT MAY BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046 AS FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THE NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO IS NONE WHATEVER NOW
4350-9170-0049 IF FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0051 THIS REGIMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBOURS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHICH MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFEAT AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBOURS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO THE MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WILL IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND HABIT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH TO THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GOOD INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000 SAYS YOU KNOW SOMETHING
4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR JACK AND SPARKS PLUG
4852-28311-0002 NO WHO NEEDS THE JOB BUT THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS
4852-28311-0003 O K HE
4852-28311-0004 OH WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN EMING STREET
4852-28311-0006 WELL HE ADMITTED I WOULD
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ASKED BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008 THINKING HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUST EDGED INTO THE STREET WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011 BITCH AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED IN HIM
4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE TABLE
4852-28311-0013 THE SHUCKS
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILLS ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT DOWN INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARDS THE BACK OF THE BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON TO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWERING AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THE JOBS
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED IT
4852-28311-0020 AT A FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ONLY CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTRE THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GRAND GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023 FOR THE NAMES STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY MAN GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER ASK
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOKE IN FROM HIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHOP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOME ONE SHOULD ANSWER A BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH A ONE WINDOW IN THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0003 HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS REACHED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0004 MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT SMITH COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN TO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE FROM THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0007 TOM BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0008 PHILIP SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
4852-28312-0009 YES SO HE SAID
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOBS
4852-28312-0011 AND HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE
4852-28312-0012 JAKIE HARRIS'S NAME IS HE REALLY NEEDS A JOB
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE BATH WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSIBLE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THAT IT MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE KING'S GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALTUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARDS THE ATAPHIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018 THE ROOM SEEMED OVERY STILL
4852-28312-0019 THEN IN THAT SECOND SHE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28312-0020 THE BROAD BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHEN IS THE FREEWAY
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE BLACK WALLS AND SMOKE STACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023 THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THEIR
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS KEITH WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRICAL SIGNS NO LAMPLIT STREETS
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS IN WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
4852-28312-0027 A COURTYARD WAS SPARELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A WIDE AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0029 A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE CLANGED COURTYARD
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF THROUGH THE STABLE
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO HAVE TO SEE
4852-28319-0000 THE LEARNING OF THAT MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
4852-28319-0001 HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOST HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28319-0002 CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL OF THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOTTLE WITH A GOLD FISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHOULD ALL THAT DO FIRST
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU'VE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY THAT IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T STAND BACK
4852-28319-0007 MISTER WALKER WAITED PATIENTLY BEHIND HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0008 THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER QUIGGER SAID START AT ONCE
4852-28319-0009 THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER OR FASTER
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED TOWARD THE FINAL WORDS
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT SINCE BY
4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR TWO ONE THE RETURN
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE BY CURVED UP POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0014 THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME INTO CHRIS
4852-28319-0015 IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE LET THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED A CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0017 BUT HOW DID I CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
4852-28319-0018 CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE OUT TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIR CASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY HE RESUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE THEM INCREASED IN STORM
4852-28319-0021 DUST CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE THAT TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY
4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED THE PROPER TIME
4852-28319-0023 MISTER BROOKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKE AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCION FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF HIS NEGRO BOY
4852-28319-0025 HE WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES THE WIDEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THAT COAT AND OH THE FACE
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED LET A BOUQUET FALL
4852-28330-0000 THEY RAN DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER FINNER WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED FROM THE HELM BY ALBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'D KEEP MY EYES OPEN
4852-28330-0004 THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAITI
4852-28330-0005 WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE OFF THERE
4852-28330-0006 CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED HE HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0007 CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATIVE
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINNELL WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD HERE
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT BE NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD OF HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR I CANNOT SAY THAT I DO
4852-28330-0012 THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE AND MOTHER OR FAMILY
4852-28330-0013 HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT FRED STANDING BEFORE HIM
4852-28330-0014 WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THAT RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE
4852-28330-0015 THIS SHIP AND ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY HER SIR
4852-28330-0017 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASE IN ITS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0018 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THAT COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0019 CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME SHE HAD UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0020 WHAT MIGHT BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS OUGHT TO ASK
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW
4852-28330-0022 I SHALL SAY THAT WE ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE LEFT MISTER WICKER AND CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTIONOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR
4852-28330-0025 THERE CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
533-1066-0000 WE CHURCHYARDS YAN
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR WOOD
533-1066-0002 I'M SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KILLING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
533-1066-0003 FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE ARE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL IN THE LODGE
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOCTED PURE MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0005 MISS INANS HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UPSTAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TO NIGHT
533-1066-0006 I HAVE ONE I SAID HAPPILY
533-1066-0007 I MEAN HE INSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL
533-1066-0008 THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACELESS NIGHT
533-1066-0009 SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCCUR SAID
533-1066-0010 PUT ON THICK SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
533-1066-0011 LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF A JUST WHEN I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
533-1066-0012 THEY WERE TALKING COHERENTLY TOGETHER AND WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
533-1066-0013 THERE WAS A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0014 I ASKED NO
533-1066-0015 ONCE ONLY NOBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STUART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE
533-1066-0016 I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I ANSWERED
533-1066-0017 THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHEN WE FINALLY CAME INTO A HALT
533-1066-0018 I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A CURIOUS SPOT
533-1066-0019 IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN QUICKLY
533-1066-0020 IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPATES
533-1066-0021 THE OFFICER KEPT A KEEN LOOKOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED
533-1066-0022 THERE'S ONE THING SURE AND I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY
533-1066-0023 A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT PIGGING THEM UP
533-1066-0024 I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED ON
533-131556-0000 BUT HOW AM I TO GET THROUGH THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY GO
533-131556-0001 FOR NONE COULD ENDURE ME AS HE HAS DONE YOU
533-131556-0002 THE WAR STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING WHICH SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
533-131556-0004 I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD THEM SO SECRETLY
533-131556-0005 THEY HAD OVERTAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH THE BOOK
533-131556-0006 I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT PRESUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT
533-131556-0007 UPON PERUSING THIS SHE HAD TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP
533-131556-0008 YOU CAN GO MILICENT AND SHE'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT
533-131556-0009 HE'LL OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE
533-131556-0010 HUMPH YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS
533-131556-0011 IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS HE REPLIED I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE
533-131556-0012 I ENJOY A MOONLIGHT RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THE DRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESORTS
533-131556-0013 SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER LIPS AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
533-131556-0014 I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS IN A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
533-131556-0015 HERE YES
533-131556-0016 AND SUPPOSE I DO
533-131556-0017 SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT STIR
533-131556-0018 I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE CRIED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
533-131556-0019 IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL RATHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR ADETTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
533-131556-0020 I SHALL NOT LET HIM
533-131556-0021 GIVE ME NO THANKS IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKES THAT I REFRAIN
533-131556-0022 AND MILICENT WILL YOU HELP HER
533-131556-0023 I WOULD NOT FOR MUCH THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF HER RELIGION
533-131556-0024 YOU USE SHARP WORDS MISSUS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU
533-131556-0025 HOW DARE YOU MENTION HIS NAME TO YOU
533-131562-0000 IT SEEMS VERY INTERESTING LOVE SAYS HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO WHERE I STOOD WRINGING MY HANDS IN SILENT RAGE AND ANGUISH BUT IT'S RATHER LONG I'LL LOOK AT IT SOME OTHER TIME AND MEANWHILE I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KISS MY DEAR WHAT KISS
533-131562-0001 THE KEYS OF YOUR CABINET DESK DRAWER AND WHATEVER ELSE WE POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
533-131562-0002 THE KEY OF MY VEST IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHER WERE ATTACHED TO IT
533-131562-0003 NOW THEN SNEERED HE WE MIGHT HAVE A CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY
533-131562-0004 AND PUTTING THE KEYS INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO A LIBRARY
533-131562-0005 THAT AND ALL CRIED THE MASTER AND THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
533-131562-0006 MISTER HUNTINGDON AGAIN WENT UPSTAIRS
533-131562-0007 MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE'S A VERY DEVIL FOR A SPITE
533-131562-0008 I WOULDN'T SAY I'D BROKEN IT DID I RETURNED HE
533-131562-0009 I SHALL PUT YOU UP AND A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE FOR YOUR OWN PRIVATE EXPENSES AND YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ANY MORE ABOUT MY CONCERNS I SHALL LOOK OUT FOR A STEWARD MY DEAR I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO THE TEMPTATION
533-131562-0010 AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GRAEBS MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO UP ON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN
533-131562-0011 WHAT GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE YOU MADE ON MISTER HUNTINGDON
533-131562-0012 HAVE I CONTENTED TO DEFRAUD YOU
533-131562-0013 NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS THAT IT'S BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
533-131562-0014 HERE BENSON ENTERED AT THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENTLY TRIUMPHING IN MY DESPAIR
533-131562-0015 I KNOW THAT DAY AFTERDAY SUCH FEELINGS WILL RETURN UPON ME
533-131562-0016 I TRY TO LOOK TO HIM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT HE WILL CLEAVE TO THE DUST
533-131564-0000 VAIN HOPE I SAY
533-131564-0001 MISTER AND MISSUS HATTERSLEY HAVE BEEN STAYING AT THE GROVE A FORTNIGHT AND AS MISTER HARGRAVE IS STILL ABSENT AND THE WEATHER WAS REMARKABLY FINE I NEVER PASSED A DAY WITHOUT SEEING MY TWO FRIENDS MILICENT AND ESTHER EITHER THERE OR HERE
533-131564-0002 NO INSTEAD YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT HIM HOME
533-131564-0003 I CAN'T YOU DON'T WANT HIM DO
533-131564-0004 IT IS THE RESOLUTION YOU HAVE FORMED LONG AGO
533-131564-0005 WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF A LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS THOUGH WE CAN'T SUSPECT HIM
533-131564-0006 NO I'D RATHER BE LIKE HIMSELF THAN AS I AM
533-131564-0007 NEVER MIND MY PLAN SPEAKING SAID I IT IS FROM THE BEST OF MOTIVES

533-131564-0014 WHAT COULD YOU MAKE OF ME AND THE CHILDREN TO BE SURE THAT WORR HEARD TO DEATH BETWEEN THEM
533-131564-0015 I KNOW YOU ARE BLESS THEM
533-131564-0016 HE FOLLOWED ME FROM THE LIBRARY
533-131564-0017 I SOUGHT OUT AND PUT INTO HIS HANDS TWO OF MILICENT'S LETTERS ONE DATED FROM LONDON AND WRITTEN DURING ONE OF HIS WILDEST SEASONS OF RECKLESS DISSIPATION THE OTHER IN A COUNTRY DURING A LUCID INTERVAL
533-131564-0018 THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMS B AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENIOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON THE OTHER MAN'S SHOULDERS
533-131564-0019 I'VE BEEN A CURSED RASCAL GOD KNOWS SAID HE AS HE GAVE IT AN EARTHY SQUEEZE BUT YOU SEE IF I DON'T MAKE AMENDS FOR IT DAMNED ME IF I DON'T

533-131564-0027 AFTER THAT THEY'LL REPAIR TO THEIR COUNTRY HOME
5442-32873-0000 CAPTAIN LAKE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE A GENTLEMAN DANDIE NOW
5442-32873-0001 THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND WITH A WILD LURE IN HIS YELLOW EYES RACHEL SAT DOWN
5442-32873-0002 A SLAVE MAY THINK A SLAVE
5442-32873-0003 OH FRIGHTFUL FEARFUL IS IT A DREAM
5442-32873-0004 OH FRIGHTFULLY DREADFUL
5442-32873-0005 STANLEY STANLEY IT WOULD BE MERCY TO KILL ME SHE BROKE A AGAIN
5442-32873-0006 BRIGHT AND GNATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND THE PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH A BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF A SAGE HER PILLOW SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
5442-32873-0007 WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TOILET BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH A LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
5442-32873-0008 THERE WAS NOTHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED IN HER PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE PROCESS
5442-32873-0009 THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER BEDROOM
5442-32873-0010 AND SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THAT GLASS
5442-32873-0011 RACHAEL LEAKE RACHEL LAKE WHAT ARE YOU NOW
5442-32873-0012 I'LL STAY HERE THAT IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE PLACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-32873-0013 HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THE MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGGETT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0014 LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKINS'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WILDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOLL CART FOR MIKE BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOCK CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
5442-32873-0015 BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LINE WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARD THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGDEN
5442-32873-0016 HERE WERE A FLOW OF SOLE AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELLED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
5442-32873-0017 LOSE NO TIME AND I'LL HAVE YOU HALF A CRUMB
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STUCK AT HIS GREASY WIDE AWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOLL CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK THAT NIGHT TAMAR
5442-41168-0000 THE ART SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY AND BALLOT
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COARSE SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN THE MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR OTTO A BALL
5442-41168-0004 WE SHED OUR BLOOD IN OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE'S NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0006 VOTES PLEASE MISS E
5442-41168-0007 THEY HAVE EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOUT FLERROFF SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FRAOV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD GREAT RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THAT PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT BAR
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED A SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JURED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH THIS QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0014 SODY IVANOVITCH CROWNED
5442-41168-0015 THAT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN JUDGMENT HE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THROWN HIS LEFT HAND TO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0017 A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX OF ADMISSION NINETY EIGHT AGAINST
5442-41168-0018 SANGER THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
5442-41168-0019 AND THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO KNOTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX
5442-41168-0020 BUT THE OLD PARTY DOES NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERED
5442-41168-0021 IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCES HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THAT EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0023 AS THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE
5442-41168-0024 AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOORS
5442-41168-0025 AND THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTION
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNEDTKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT FLEROV TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN THE SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMEN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERJY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0001 HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID AROUND HIM
5442-41169-0002 HE'S GOT A BLACKGUARD
5442-41169-0003 I HAVE TOLD ME SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
5442-41169-0004 THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE HE COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON TO YOUR EXCELLENCY FINE CHAMPAGNE
5442-41169-0006 LAST YEAR AFTER OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S
5442-41169-0007 YES STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
5442-41169-0008 FOR WHAT IS THERE TO UNDERSTAND
5442-41169-0009 THERE IS NO BEGINNING IN IT AT ALL
5442-41169-0010 THEN TOO HE MUST KEEP UP CONNECTIONS
5442-41169-0011 IT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF A STATE
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO TELL A TRUTH THERE'S ONE'S OWN INTEREST
5442-41169-0013 THEY ARE PROPRIETORS OF A SODE BUT WE ARE THE LANDOWNERS
5442-41169-0014 THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTIVELY
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THAT OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND WHAT IS YOUR LAND DOING
5442-41169-0017 BUT ONE'S WORK HAS THROWN IN FOR NOTHING
5442-41169-0018 OH WELL ONE DOES THAT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0019 AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY FATHER I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT OFF AND YET ONE DOES IT
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELD AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASILVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'D CAST DOWN THE LIME TREE
5442-41169-0023 HERE YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BRACH
5442-41169-0024 YOU'RE MARRIED I HEARD SAYS THE LANDOWNER
5442-41169-0025 YES IT'S RATHER STRANGE THEY WENT ON
5442-41169-0026 THIS LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MOUSTACHES
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR POGS FOR TEMPLE
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK ME
5442-41169-0029 THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT NOT TO DO
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANTS TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A RETURN TWO AT A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLAUS VISITED HIM AGAIN
5484-24317-0001 BUT HERMANN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANE
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT THE UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS APPLICATION
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF HIS ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF A VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTILIS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACT
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE LABORING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOW TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0010 WHILE HERMANN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATIUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENDO
5484-24317-0012 TRUE THAT INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELL CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMAN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0014 CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICHKO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENOS'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSIMCHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0016 OF THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HARMON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES AND TIRING WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISE ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN HIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMYNTES THE LIEGE CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLIS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONES
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSANUS IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FROM A FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID SUDDENLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAST REPLIED HERMANN
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENOS HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAS INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0026 HERMANN LISTENED TO THE PRAYER IN SILENCE
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSENUS ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRATEZ HERMANN'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMEANOUR WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THIS MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF OTHER MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24317-0030 BUT EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMAND'S REGARD
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER BIG BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WAS STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION IN THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNAS ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDERS
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND OR IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMANN PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THIS PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE SENT TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ARTS
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN END AS A BOOM FROM THE WORLDS
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS COMPLETE AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM THEY DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMANN WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER IF ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTLE AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A MIGHTY DEITY
5484-24318-0010 YET THAT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST TASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED BY GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILLOPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERRIMAND IN GRATEFUL ADMIRATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME HOW TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPA SILENCED HER WITH A GREAT EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHILE HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEPEST DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALASTER THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND THEY LOVED YOU ALWAYS
5484-24318-0021 DAPHNE SHE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMANN WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOT
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORKER MYRTIUS
5484-24318-0024 WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITING YOU
5484-24318-0025 AND I FOOL BLINDED ALSO OF MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MY MINE CONCEAL AND PALLIATE NOTHING
5484-24318-0027 SOERCAIUS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF AND THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMINE TEZ THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0030 PERHAPS HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROGGED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5484-24318-0032 EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT HAPPENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS JUST VALUE
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO LOUDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERMANN
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SATULUS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HERONN
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE THEY HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0037 HONOUR TO MYRTELUS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FEAST ALL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMPS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR AND ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THIS GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST
5764-299665-0001 WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF CHRIST AND MYSELF
5764-299665-0002 SURELY ANY PRAYER WAS EVER ANSWERED
5764-299665-0003 WHY DID HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUAL FEVER
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DOES HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0005 OF THE FAILURES UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0006 IS YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH A LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOWED FROM THE BREASTS OF FATHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0008 IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION AND THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0009 DID THIS GOD A LAD THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0010 DID HE ILLOT TYRANTS TO SHED A BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0011 CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A NOVEL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DIVORX HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE ALL LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NERVE THINK OF BLINDING THE MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
5764-299665-0015 FEAR BUILDS THE ALTAR AND OFFERS HIS SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0016 FEAR ERECTS ITS CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0017 LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST THEM
5764-299665-0018 AND WE SAY THAT HE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
5764-299665-0019 COULD WE SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDURED FOREVER
5764-299665-0020 BUT WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0021 WAS MY GOODNESS WAS THERE WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0022 OUGHT THIS SUPERIOR RACE TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THE INFERIOR
5764-299665-0023 MOST PEOPLE WILL CLING TO THE SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0024 IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD WE IMAGINE ANOTHER
5764-299665-0025 WHAT IS THIS FIRE
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES GREAT EXPERIENCE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COME FROM WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0028 HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND KNEW THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD HARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPED IT WITH HIS DIMPLED HAND
5764-299665-0030 THIS POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAD TAUGHT THE CHILD A LESSON
5764-299665-0031 IT IS ONE RESULT
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBEDIENCE WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0033 WE LIVE TOGETHER AGAIN IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS
5764-299665-0034 THEY'RE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
5764-299665-0035 THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS REAL
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD COMPANIONS
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAD SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF A LOVE
5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE ADVANCE TO THE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0039 THE IMAGINATION IS COMPLETED
5764-299665-0040 A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE FACE OF ANOTHER
5764-299665-0041 THE SENSE OF DUTY APPEARS STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
5764-299665-0042 MAN JUDGE TO HIMSELF
5764-299665-0043 FROM ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0044 MAN HAS PRECEDED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HES CHRISTIANITY DUN GOND
5764-299665-0046 WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL WE WERE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS OUR RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY OR AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAD BEEN WORTH WITHOUT RELIGION
5764-299665-0049 SHOULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0050 WHAT WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DO FOR THEM
5764-299665-0051 THEY HATED A PLEASURE
5764-299665-0052 THEY MUFFLED ALL THE BELLS OF GLADES
5764-299665-0053 THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED CUSTOM
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALMOST MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCES OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN IT
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC BELIEF
5764-299665-0058 HAS THE REBEL MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES SHE HAS FAILED
5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE FOR INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
5764-299665-0061 RELIGION HAS NEVER MADE MEN FREER
5764-299665-0062 IT HAS NEVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS HONEST
5764-299665-0063 ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE AND NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARER HONEST THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0064 CAN WE CURE DISEASED BY SUPPLICATION
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR NONE AS ALMS
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT ITS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAYER AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE CORN ON THE STONES
5764-299665-0068 THIS STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A BASMENT
5764-299665-0069 IF WE LEAD WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM
5764-299665-0070 I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER STORES
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST STONE IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED NOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNERSTONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FAITH ARE FROM END TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN AND CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN TO BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0075 I SAY WHAT WE THINK
5764-299665-0076 EVERY EVENT HAS A PARENTS
5764-299665-0077 IT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED COULD NOT
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHAINED RICE AND THE CAMP BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINKS
5764-299665-0079 WE NOW KNOW THAT HER FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0080 WE ONLY KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE PATH OF LIFE HAS TRAVELLED
5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE PLACES OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE PEOPLE
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE THE REFORMERS FOLLOWED
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND ON THE LORD ON LIFE AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE WITH FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0087 FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE LIKE
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PRODUCED WITHOUT A PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
5764-299665-0089 MUST THE WORLD FOREVER REMAIN THIS VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE A BURDEN AND CURSE AS WHY
5764-299665-0091 PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DARK
5764-299665-0092 LAW CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PERMIT CRIME
5764-299665-0093 THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY ATTACK OR EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0094 THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF HIS WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0095 THIS FREES ME
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME WILL BE CHILDFUL
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FAULTS IN BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE
6070-63485-0000 THERE DONE FIRST SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOW KEY TO THE CHOUETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE
6070-63485-0001 THE TWO MONSTERS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND WALKED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSES
6070-63485-0002 BY MEANS OF THIS STRATAGEM THEY FOLLOWED SO CLOSELY THAT ALTHOUGH WITHIN A FEW STEPS OF SARAH AND TOM I DID NOT HEAR THEM
6070-63485-0003 SARAH AND HER BROTHER HAVING AGAIN PASSED BY THE TUPPY FRANC ARRIVED CLOSE TO THE DILAPIDATED HOUSE WHICH WAS PARTLY IN RUINS AND ITS ORPEN CELLARS FORMED A KIND OF GULF ALONG WHICH THE STREET RAN IN THAT DIRECTION
6070-63485-0004 IN AN INSTANT THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH A LEAP RESEMBLING IN STRENGTH AND AGILITY THE SPRING OF A TIGER SEIZED SATAN WITH ONE HAND BY THE THROAT AND EXCLAIMED YOUR MONEY OR I'LL FLING YOU INTO THIS HOLE
6070-63485-0005 NO SAID THE OLD BRUTE GRUMBLINGLY NO NOT ONE RING AND WHAT A SHAME
6070-63485-0006 TOM KEYTON DID NOT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND DURING THIS SCENE RAPIDLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AS IT HAD OCCURRED
6070-63485-0007 OF AH TO LAY A TRAP TO CATCH US REPLIED THE THIEF
6070-63485-0008 THEN ADDRESSING THOMAS SEYTON YOU KNOW THE PLANTE OF SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0009 DID YOU SEE INTO THE CABARET WE HAVE JUST LEFT FOR I KNOW YOU AGAIN THE MAN WHOM THE CHARCOAL MAN CAME TO SEEK
6070-63485-0010 CRIED THE SCHOOLMASTER A THOUSAND FRANCS AND I'LL TELL HIM
6070-63485-0011 WRETCHED I DO NOT SEEK HIS LIFE REPLIED SARAH TO THE SCHOOLMASTER
6070-63485-0012 LET'S GO AND TELL HIM
6070-63485-0013 ALL NIGHT IT WILL BE FOR LOOKING AFTER
6070-63485-0014 WELL MY WIFE SHALL BE THERE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER YOU WILL TELL HER WHAT YOU WANTED AND I SHALL SEE
6070-63485-0015 IN THE PLAIN AT SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0016 BETWEEN SAINT OIN AND THE ROAD OF LA RIVATE AT THE END OF THE ROAD AGREED
6070-63485-0017 HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS OF THE SELF STYLED FIN PAINTER
6070-63485-0018 THE FISCAS STARTED
6070-86744-0000 FRANCIS WHO SEEMED ATTRACTED BY SOME INVISIBLE INFLUENCE TOWARDS THE COUNT IN WHICH TERROR WAS STRANGELY MINGLED FELT AN EXTREME RELUCTANCE TO PERMIT HIS FRIEND TO BE EXPOSED ALONE TO THE SINGULAR FASCINATION THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE SEEMED TO EXERCISE OVER HIM AND THEREFORE MADE NO OBJECTION TO ALBERT'S REQUEST BUT AT ONCE ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DESIRED SPOT AND AFTER A SHORT DELAY THE COUNT JOINED THEM IN THE SALON
6070-86744-0001 MY VERY GOOD FRIEND AN EXCELLENT NATURE REPLIED THE COUNT WITH A SMILE YOU REALLY EXAGGERATE MY TRIFLING EXERTIONS
6070-86744-0002 MY FATHER THE COMTE DE MORCERF ALTHOUGH OF SPANISH ORIGIN POSSESSES CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE BOTH AT THE COURT OF FRANCE AND MADRID AND I UNHESITATINGLY PLACE THE BEST SERVICES OF MYSELF AND ALL TO WHOM MY LIFE WAS DEAR AT YOUR DISPOSAL
6070-86744-0003 HE CAN SCARCELY CREDIT IT
6070-86744-0004 NOW IT IS SETTLED SAID THE COUNT AND I GIVE YOU MY SOLEMN ASSURANCE THAT I ONLY WAITED AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THE PRESENT TO REALIZE PLANS THAT I HAVE LONG MEDITATED

6070-86744-0007 I RESIDE IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE BUT OCCUPY A PAVILION AT THE FOREST SIDE OF THE COURTYARD AND TILE IS SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN BUILDING
6070-86744-0008 NOW THEN SAID THE COUNT RETURNING HIS TABLETS TO HIS POCKET MAKE YOURSELF PERFECTLY EASY THE HAND OF YOUR TIMEPIECE WILL NOT BE MORE ACCURATE IN MARKING THIS TIME THAN MYSELF
6070-86744-0009 THAT DEPENDS WHEN DO YOU LEAVE IT
6070-86744-0010 FOR FRANCE NO FOR VENICE I SHALL REMAIN IN ITALY FOR ANOTHER YEARS OR TWO
6070-86744-0011 THEN WE SHALL NOT BE IN PARIS
6070-86744-0012 I FEAR I WILL NOT HAVE THAT HONOR
6070-86744-0013 THEN SINCE WE MUST PART SAID THE COUNT HOLDING OUT A HAND TO EACH OF THE YOUNG MEN ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU BOTH A SAFE AND PLEASANT JOURNEY
6070-86744-0014 WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED ALBERT OF FRANCE WHEN THEY HAD RETURNED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS YOU SEEM MORE THAN COMMONLY THOUGHTLESS
6070-86744-0015 I WILL CONFESS TO YOU ALBERT REPLIED FRANZ THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FITS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0016 DID YOU EVER MEET HIM PREVIOUSLY TO COMING THERE
6070-86744-0017 UPON MY HONOR THEN LISTENED TO ME
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY IN THE ALMOST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAM AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YACHT SEEN IN THE DISTANT HORIZONS DRIVING UNDER FULL SAIL TOWARD PORTO VECCHIO
6070-86744-0019 THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDITE PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86744-0020 BUT SAID FRANZ THE CORSICAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF THE VESSEL
6070-86744-0021 WHY MAYBE THE THING SEEMS TO ME SIMPLE ENOUGH
6070-86744-0022 TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DID HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT WERE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINGTURED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY
6070-86744-0023 SIMPLY THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANSWERED
6070-86744-0024 MY DEAR FRANTZ REPLIED ALBERT WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO DELIVER
6070-86744-0025 WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHICH IS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY IS HE A NATIVE
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESSED HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SIGNOR VAMPA WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASE AND UNCONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THEIR YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ALBERT'S SIDE
6070-86744-0028 WELL SAID FRANZ WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT FOR OUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND MY POWERS OF REFUTATION
6070-86744-0029 AND NOW MY DEAR FRANZ LET US TALK OF ANYTHING ELSE
6070-86745-0000 THEN SHOULD ANY THING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS THE PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND LED FROM THE GARDEN AND COURT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0002 AT A QUARTER TO TEN A VALET ENTERED HE COMPOSED WITH A LITTLE GROOM NAMED JEAN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASSEUR ALSO
6070-86745-0003 WAIT THEN DURING THAT DAY TELL ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISHES
6070-86745-0004 VERY WELL TO HALF PAST TEN
6070-86745-0005 IS THE COUNTESS OFF YET
6070-86745-0006 THE VALET LEFT THE DOOR
6070-86745-0007 GOOD MORNING LUCIEN GOOD MORNING SAID ALBERT MY PUNCTUALITY REALLY ALARMS ME
6070-86745-0008 YOU WHOM I EXPECTED LAST YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIX WAS HALF PAST
6070-86745-0009 NO NO MY DEAREST FELLOW DO NOT CONFOUND OUR PLANS
6070-86745-0010 YES HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGES IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTEENTH
6070-86745-0011 IT IS FOR THAT REASON YOU HEAR ME SO EARLY
6070-86745-0012 I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO HAVE A TRY FOR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 PESTS I'LL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT YOU WOULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE
6070-86745-0014 BESIDES THAT DO NOT CONCERN THE HOME BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
6070-86745-0015 ABOUT WHAT OF THE PAPERS
6070-86745-0016 AT THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH BLOOD YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE
6070-86745-0018 COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIERE
6070-86745-0019 WITH YOUR TALENTS YOU WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM MY TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
6128-63240-0001 THAT HAS UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
6128-63240-0002 THEN SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORKIDAY ASPECT
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED SNAKE
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH PLAINLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS THE EYES HOWEVER WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY EXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTONFIELD
6128-63240-0009 BUT HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPEAS AND ROARING RADICALS
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU'RE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT O MURDER
6128-63240-0012 HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUMNER WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6128-63240-0013 SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LAURA
6128-63240-0014 HAVE YOU BEEN INTO EUROPE
6128-63240-0015 NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANY
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK WAS MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LENA
6128-63240-0018 ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE A
6128-63240-0019 AND MISSUS LENA ADDED THAT WHILE SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0020 ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME UP FOR
6128-63240-0021 BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN HUSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0022 THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY TROUBLES
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATURAL GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNY'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT INTO HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A DINNER PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINED SO EARLY
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LINNEY'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSLOW THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BOEOTIAN AS THAT MOMENT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LON'S SISTER
6128-63241-0002 RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE ISSUE OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0003 HE WERE SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST HIS RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0005 HIS FATHER WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM HIS STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HIS LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF DISCERNING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0009 OLIVE HAD HER FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFER AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT TO THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0012 HE WAS TOO SICK TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT IS VERY POSSIBLE BAZER RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF WHO THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE LADIES OF BEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT THAT BALLOT
6128-63244-0002 PERHAPS IT COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE BETTER
6128-63244-0004 OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WAS SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE FOR A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0005 ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLES LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FAMENDER WHO LIVED AT RUXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FERRINGERS SUPPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0007 SHE TRIED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE
6128-63244-0008 THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NEVER FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0009 CHARLIE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WHITE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR AND IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH THE MOST
6128-63244-0010 OLIVE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MISSUS SPARRINGAR WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
6128-63244-0011 IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEP TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING
6128-63244-0012 OUR MOTIVE IS FOR ALL IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
6128-63244-0013 RAISE THE STANDARD AMONG THEM AND BRING ME HER THOUSAND NAMES
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CURRANTS MISSUS CARVENDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0015 SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSION OF HER RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0016 HE WONT TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE VERY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THEIR SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
6128-63244-0018 NOT THE UNHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
6128-63244-0019 THEY WERE HER SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN BUT THE DAY OF THEIR DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT THE JUST REVELATION IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTAL BLOOD STAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0021 THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMEN WEAK INTELLECTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE MIST OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSIE'S SUCCESS
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BIRD'S EYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL FACE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEM ALREADY A MARTYR
6128-63244-0024 OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG AND DEWARDED WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OR AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES AS A OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
6432-63722-0000 BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YOU FIGURE ON DOIN SOME DETECTIVEIN AN GIVING UP FISHING
6432-63722-0001 AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF THE OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
6432-63722-0002 I'M GOING OFF FISH AND I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING AND MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
6432-63722-0003 GET READY SHAG YASSAH COLONEL
6432-63722-0004 AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HAD HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEIGH WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
6432-63722-0005 PINKUS AND DONOVAN HAVEN'T THEY CARROLL YOUUP
6432-63722-0006 CAROL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST NOW TO SAY MORE
6432-63722-0007 ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON IN THAT CASE COLONEL
6432-63722-0008 BUT I HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT COLONEL THAN THAT CAT
6432-63722-0009 PERHAPS PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED COLONEL ASHLEY
6432-63722-0010 WE'VE GOT OUR GUN AND THAT'S ALL WE WANT
6432-63722-0011 YOU'RE ON THE DARCY CASE YOU TELL ME IN A WAY YES
6432-63722-0012 I AM WORKING IN THE INTERESTS OF THE YOUNG MEN
6432-63722-0013 IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE COINCIDENCES LIKE
6432-63722-0014 BUSTED MY HEAD IN WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK ONE OF A PAIR
6432-63722-0015 GD EXPLAINED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0016 THE VERY PAIR I WAS GOING TO BUY IT
6432-63722-0017 LOOK HERE COLONEL DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM
6432-63722-0018 AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDNESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGLA PHUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63722-0020 AND I'M AFRAID I WON'T BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
6432-63722-0021 FOUTE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED SHER ALI
6432-63722-0022 ANYHOW HE AND FUDDLE DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY WELL IT SEEMS
6432-63722-0023 NEIGHBORS OFTEN HEARD EM SCRAPPIN A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
6432-63722-0024 TOWARD DARK A WOMAN WENT IN TO BUY A LAMP
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND THIS HEAVY CANDLESTICK ON IT
6432-63722-0026 SURE HELD SO TIGHT YOU COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
6432-63722-0027 MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOES TALKED ON THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0028 ON THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT YES IT'S HERE
6432-63722-0029 THAT'S THE WATCH ANNOUNCED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE REACHING IN FOR IT GOING LIKE SEE
6432-63722-0030 YOU'RE NOT AS SQUEAMISH AS ALL THAT ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A GOOD MAN'S HANDS AND A WOMAN'S
6432-63722-0031 AND DONALMON'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SCEPTICAL
6432-63722-0032 YES IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUGH EDGES
6432-63722-0033 AND I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISED YOU TO BE CAREFUL
6432-63722-0034 IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THESE A BIT
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT S SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS ON THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TURN HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL
6432-63722-0038 AND DONOVAN TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE
6432-63722-0039 I ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE YES
6432-63722-0040 DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF ON IT WHATEVER YOU DO I NOT
6432-63722-0041 SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS WATCH IT

6432-63722-0044 I SINGA PHUT WAS THE PANTING ANSWER
6432-63722-0045 I WANT TO TALK OVER DARCY'S CASE WITH YOU THE COLONEL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD THOUGHT HAD WALKED AGAIN AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
6432-63722-0046 WHAT WERE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0047 RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSAL
6432-63722-0048 AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SKETCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0049 AN YOU I DON'T WANT IT EITHER
6432-63722-0050 BUT WE WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW

6432-63722-0052 IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I LL PRETEND I'M FISHING AND I MAY CATCH SOMETHING
6432-63722-0053 IN FACT I HAVE A FEELING THAT IT'LL LAND MY FISH
6432-63722-0054 I'D RECOMMEND HIM TO YOU INSTEAD OF BLACKSTONE' THANKS LAPPED KENNETH
6432-63722-0055 WHAT'S IT PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU

6432-63722-0058 NO ARIMONY REPLIED THE COLONEL PUZZLED YES JUST THAT
6432-63722-0059 AND THERE'S NO REASON I SHOULDN'T KNOW
6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO BE LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
6432-63723-0001 AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE LONG LIMP FISH INTO THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
6432-63723-0002 THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INQUIRED OF KENNETH
6432-63723-0003 NO SHE WASN'T THINKING OF THAT
6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER YOU DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
6432-63723-0005 WHY I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
6432-63723-0006 IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON A LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
6432-63723-0007 IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTIES ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARKIN STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0009 THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS OF HIM
6432-63723-0010 AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING REPEATEDLY CONFIRMED
6432-63723-0011 HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD EVER BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012 SHE SAID THAT HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0013 PERHAPS LARCH MADE NO DEFENCE
6432-63723-0014 LARCH AFTER REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK A COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNCIL FEE
6432-63723-0016 NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GIVE JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0017 AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF FRIENDS TO MAKE IT UP
6432-63723-0018 STILL I HAD LIKE TO KNOW
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD BE BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0020 IT HAD HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALL ROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFES
6432-63723-0022 LARSCH HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
6432-63723-0023 IN A SMALLER PLAY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
6432-63723-0024 AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME SURELY THAT CYNTHIA RACHFORD HAD MARRIED
6432-63723-0025 TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED TO MONEY
6432-63723-0026 AND IN A WAY IT WAS REAL
6432-63723-0027 THEY ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
6432-63723-0028 AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL WHICH COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
6432-63723-0029 THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY BUT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
6432-63723-0030 THEN IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
6432-63723-0031 IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THAT VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL
6432-63723-0032 MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING COULD BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
6432-63723-0033 DON'T WORRY YOU WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0034 I AM GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT I WILL TAKE TIME
6432-63723-0035 IT'S HARD FOR MISS MAPSON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP LIKE A MAJOR
6432-63723-0036 SO KING GOT BAIL BUT PUT IT UP
6432-63723-0037 IT WAS HIGH LATCH

6432-63723-0053 THERE WAS A RATTLING OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
6432-63723-0054 IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE WHICH MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
6432-63723-0055 I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE HE WAS KILLED
6432-63723-0056 THIS WAS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELLER
6432-63723-0057 NOW HARRY KING HAVE IT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY

6938-70848-0006 WHO ARE YOU A COUNTER REVOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THE BELOVED ADAME
6938-70848-0007 YOU CALL YOURSELVES THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU ARE NOT PEOPLE OF RUSSIA
6938-70848-0008 THE PEASANTS ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS AND
6938-70848-0009 WE KNOW WHAT THE PLANETS WILL SAY AREN'T THEY WORKING MEN LIKE OURSELVES
6938-70848-0010 THIS MAN ESPECIALLY WELCOMED THE CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PATIENTS
6938-70848-0011 THIS LAST WITH A YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
6938-70848-0012 MEANWHILE THE OLD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE LEFT THE HALL
6938-70848-0013 DOWN WITHIN HIM THEY SHRIEKED
6938-70848-0014 FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN THROUGH THE BOLSHEVIKI
6938-70848-0015 UPON MY RETURN I VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I FOUND AND THAT'S ALL LET ANY ONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
6938-70848-0016 MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STRATUS OF THE SPECULATIVE COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
6938-70848-0017 BY DECLINING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO PUSH THE RE ELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LAST SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF A CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRILLIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
6938-70848-0020 THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO WALK WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
6938-70848-0021 FOLLOWED HIM OLENIN LISTENED TO NOT WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
6938-70848-0022 THE FIRST AID WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISTS AND THE LANDOWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE KUGHSY RELATED
6938-70848-0023 THE DUMESS AND ZAMSTOOVS WERE DROPPED
6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKA WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED
6938-70848-0025 HE SPOKE TO THE REALM CONVENTION
6938-70848-0026 THIS VILLAGES WILL SAVE US IN THE END
6938-70848-0027 BUT THE PRESENT MINUTE IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IT IS INVINCIBLE
6938-70848-0028 THE WILL OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN THE
6938-70848-0029 A NEW HUMANITY WILL BE BORN OF THIS LAW
6938-70848-0030 I GREET YOU WITH THAT CHRISTENING OF A NEW RUSSIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM
7018-75788-0000 BUT I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED IN HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
7018-75788-0001 BEHOLD A SHIP WAS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THIS DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
7018-75788-0002 HEARING THIS I WAS SORE TROUBLED REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED TO THE APE KIND

7018-75788-0005 THEN HE CARRIED ME TO THE BEACH WHERE HE FILLED MY BAG WITH PEBBLES LARGE AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLK ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH BEARING A BAG LIKE MINE FILLED WITH PEBBLES
7018-75788-0006 TO THESE HE COMMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO THEIR CARE AND SAYING THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY GET HIS DAILY BREAD AND YE WILL EARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
7018-75788-0007 NOW SLEEPING UNDER THESE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES WHEREON MY COMPANIONS BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE FOLK
7018-75788-0008 WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAYE

7018-75788-0011 THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTER AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FORGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STORE HOUSES
7018-75788-0012 AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT WHAT I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GREAT PROFIT AND GAIN I HAD MADE
7018-75788-0013 THE NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING MOHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL CREATURES BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND WISHED HIM A GOOD DAY
7018-75788-0014 HERE I FOUND A GREAT SHIP READY TO SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD WITH THEM GOODS OF PRICE SO I EMBARKED MY BALES THEREIN
7018-75788-0015 HAPPILY AMONGST YOU IS ONE RIGHTEOUS WHOM PRAYERS THE LORD WILL ACCEPT
7018-75788-0016 PRESENTLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE LAND AND BROKE UP AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD OF HER WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75788-0017 BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS COLOUR AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE NEIGHBOURS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
7018-75788-0018 EACH THAT DIED WE WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTHES AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE TILL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT A LITTLE PROVISION LEFT I WHO WAS WONT TO HAVE SO MANY

7018-75789-0001 THEN SIGN FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND CORMORINE ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIP'S STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD MAKING ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHAIN OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
7018-75789-0002 LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE ON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS ALL NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
7018-75789-0003 I ROWED MY CONVEYANCES INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY BUT THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT IN MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0005 WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A WIDE STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
7018-75789-0006 BUT I WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE EARTH
7018-75789-0007 WHEN THEY KNEW I UNDERSTOOD THEM NOT AND MADE THEM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER
7018-75789-0008 O MY BROTHER ANSWERED HE WE ARE HUSBANDMEN AND TILLERS OF THE SOIL WHO CAME OUT TO WATER OUR FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS AND FINDING THEE ASLEEP ON THIS RAFT LAID HOLD OF IT AND MADE IT FAST BY US AGAINST THOU SHOULDEST WAKE AT THY LEISURE

7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH THEIR CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0013 SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THE I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND
7018-75789-0014 QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US ON OUR HEAD AND EYES BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST ME WITH THY COMPANY

7018-75789-0016 THEN I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND OF ALL MY INTIMATES AND ACQUAINTANCES IN THAT ISLAND AND EMBARKED WITH THE MERCHANTS AFORESAID
7018-75789-0017 HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH OR COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER
7018-75789-0018 FOR STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND UPON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUESTS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND ON HIS LEFT
7018-75789-0019 HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THIS AND AS FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST AND WITNESSED
7018-75789-0020 PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCES AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRYMAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED
7018-75789-0021 SUCH THEN O MY BROTHERS IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL ME AT MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TO MORROW INSHALLAH
7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND VALUABLE THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX
7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTEENTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINDBAD AND SEAMAN
7018-75789-0026 KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE AND ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH IN MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN HIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGHDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND THE SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLIMBED TO THE MASTHEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED ABOUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IT IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT MEN WHOSO COME HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS THE SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND IN WHICH WE HAD SEEN NAUGHT MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF THESE MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO PATTERBATH'S GUILT
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THAT TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THEIR PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTIMENT WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0004 A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BYE ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DONATION STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY TURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATH LIKE HUSH
7105-2330-0007 THE FOREMAN DELIVERED MY MESSAGE
7105-2330-0008 THE JURY FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE HOUSE
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISHED TO ADD A WRITER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A VI ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS ON HANDS
7105-2330-0010 AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE BOYS A JUNIOR CONSUL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
7105-2330-0011 FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S SO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF
7105-2330-0012 OUR MAJORITY LAST TIME WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVENTY
7105-2330-0013 SEVEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER I MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTER BAT IS OUT BEFORE THE POLE OPENS
7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RED RUPPET'S INN TO NIGHT
7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRILONI REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
7105-2330-0017 HE EXCLAIMED THAT WON'T GO
7105-2330-0018 HE SAYS HE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM ON AND HE'S NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW
7105-2330-0019 SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A RELEASED PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT UNDER THE ESTIMATES
7105-2330-0020 AND ANYWAY HE WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS A BAN
7105-2330-0021 PAULO OPENS IN FIVE MINUTES
7105-2330-0022 IS PLADDER BUFF OUT YET
7105-2330-0023 IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHY NO
7105-2330-0024 THE CHIEF ORGANIZER SWUNG OFF
7105-2330-0025 THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE STRUCK AT ONCE
7105-2330-0026 CAN'T YOU GET A STRICT PERMIT ASKED THE ORGANIZER
7105-2330-0027 I'LL TRY YOU SAID THE HOME SECRETARY AND WENT TO THE TELEPHONE
7105-2330-0028 WHEN EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WE'LL VOTE THE OTHER WAY
7105-2330-0029 OUR TELEGRAM WAS BROUGHT IN
7105-2330-0030 IT WAS FROM THE GENERAL COMETY ROOMS AT NEMESIS
7105-2330-0031 WITHOUT A BAND HE WILL NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND
7105-2330-0032 A QUARTER PAST TEN OR HALF PAST
7105-2330-0033 HAVE YOU ANY BANT INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY NATURE TO PLAY
7105-2330-0034 AND DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANIZER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS THOSE SORT OF THINGS
7105-2330-0035 THE WARDERS HAVE A PRIVATE BOND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THE MEN THEMSELVES
7105-2330-0036 LENDING US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZER
7105-2330-0037 THE POPULAR SONG OF THE MOMENT REPLIED THE AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENTS REFLECTION
7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT THROUGH THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONERS STRODE FORTH TO FREEDOM
7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF THE SIGN HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0040 THE SEAT WAS LOST AFTER ALL TO A NARROW MATURITY
7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENSE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTERBAFF FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
7105-2340-0000 WITH THAT NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIS HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON ONE WANTED INTO ONE'S HOUSE
7105-2340-0001 WELL THE FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID THE HUSBAND OR E DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE ESTATE
7105-2340-0002 BESIDES CYNICISM APART HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIS FAILING
7105-2340-0003 WHERE A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY NOT MERELY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVE NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THE THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY
7105-2340-0004 WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRED PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTERAFFECTS OF A POLO ACCIDENT
7105-2340-0005 A WILFRED FIGENCOTE HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONOURS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRED HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK
7105-2340-0006 AND THE REPUTATION IS AN UNPLEASANT ONE
7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOL DAYS ONWARD HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF CLEPTOMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANYTHING OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION
7105-2340-0008 THIS SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEONCOLE TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THEIR CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRED SAYING HE IS PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS
7105-2340-0009 SIGNED WILFRED PIGEON CO
7105-2340-0010 I SUPPOSE HE'S BRINGING US A PRESENT FOR OUR SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS
7105-2340-0011 THE DOG FLITTED NERVOUSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER
7105-2340-0012 IN THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER MY NERVOUSNESS AND AWKWARDNESS INCREASED
7105-2340-0013 OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETER SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY THE BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUESTS HERE THEY ALL ARE
7105-2340-0014 SUCH NICE USEFUL GIFTS THE FEW DIPLICATES OF COURSE
7105-2340-0015 SEVEN AND CREAM JUGS PUT IN PETER
7105-2340-0016 WE FEEL THAT WE MUST LIVE ON FRUIT FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
7105-2340-0017 OF COURSE SOME OF THEM CAN BE JOINED
7105-2340-0018 I PUT IT DOWN WITH THE CLARET JUG SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER OBJECT
7105-2340-0019 VIGILANCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY CROWNED WITH THE SENSE OF INJURY
7105-2340-0020 AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR VISITOR MISSUS PETER EXPRESSED HER CONVICTION THAT HE HAS TAKEN SOMETHING
7105-2340-0021 HOW ON EARTH ARE YOU TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I'M HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY ONE OFF
7105-2340-0022 IN THE ONLY THING TO DO
7105-2340-0023 WILFRID WAS LATE IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOMETHING WERE AMISS
7105-2340-0024 IT'S AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I' AM AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU
7105-2340-0025 IT WAS A LITTLE PRESENT FROM MY MOTHER AND MYSELF FROM YOUR SILVER WEDDING
7105-2340-0026 I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND SHE SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT RATHER AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING YOU ANOTHER
7105-2340-0027 SOME SNATCHER HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THESE MANY YEARS
7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNESTINE PIGEONCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPACT OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
7105-2340-0029 HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED BLANKLY AND DIFFERENTLY AT ONE ANOTHER
7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYBODY MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE ARE AT BREAKFAST
7105-2340-0031 SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER ARMS
7105-2340-0032 THE PIGEON COATS HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER AND MISSUS PETER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION
7105-2340-0033 PIERRE DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
7105-2340-0034 AND MISSUS PETER TURNED TO HER GUEST WITH CONFIDENTIAL COYNESS
7105-2340-0035 PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS A TRANSCENDED A FAMILY GOOD LORD
7105-2340-0036 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A CLEPTOMANIA LIKE COUSIN SNATCHY
7105-2340-0037 BRAVE LITTLE WOMAN SAID PETER WITH A GASP OF GRIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT
7902-96591-0000 I'M THROUGH THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST
7902-96591-0001 OH DON'T CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO COME
7902-96591-0002 AND AND YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUITE FRIGHTENED TONES
7902-96591-0003 I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT HIM AS YOU ARE
7902-96591-0004 THAT MY FATHER SIR RISDON GRAHAM HAS SMUGGLED GOODS
7902-96591-0005 YOU COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YOU SHALL NOT TELL
7902-96591-0006 PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHIE WAS SILENCE
7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARK LIFTED AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRES AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RAYSTROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0009 AND ALL THIS COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THAT DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0011 I'LL SOON SHOW THEN THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY APPEARED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME DOWN
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONVERSATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST ESCAPE LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILLS
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTEL PIECES FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0018 YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED I COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0019 NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NEVER DO THAT
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER TALKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE NEXT THE WALL IN TWO PLACES
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY SHOULD PASS
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE AND THE HEAD WOULD NOT BE FIRST
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT SHE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
7902-96592-0000 SURE YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES MOTHER QUITE
7902-96592-0001 I'M GOING BACK TO BREAKFAST
7902-96592-0002 SHALL I COME NOW FATHER NO
7902-96592-0003 STOP HERE TILL POOR RISDON COMES DOWN AND TELL HIM I'M VERY SORRY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED OUT LAST NIGHT ONLY A BORN FOOL SAW JERRY ANDY'S LOBSTER BOAT COMING INTO THE COVE AND CAME RUNNING TO SAY IT WAS A PARTY FROM THE CUTTER YES FATHER
7902-96592-0004 TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAN AWAY TONIGHT
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW IN THE CABIN WHERE ARCHIE REYSTROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A MERE DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEALER THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
7902-96592-0008 AND WHY DID ANDY TELL MISTER GURR FATHER
7902-96592-0009 IT WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0010 AND I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I
7902-96592-0011 NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SCENE OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TONIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAS BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD REMAIN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARED NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRAPING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONEWORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0015 REREN WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE
7902-96592-0016 HULLO HE SAID WHO ARE YE

7902-96592-0025 ARCHIE STEPPED BACK TO THE DOOR LISTENING BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND
7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM SAID THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0027 NOTHING BUT THE ENEMY PRESENTED ITSELF
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON THE CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MAD
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOWS ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASSAILING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0031 THEN AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK INTO ITS SHEATH
7902-96592-0032 NO I CAN'T PART WITH THIS HA HA HA LAUGHED THE BOY JEERINGLY
7902-96592-0033 BUT I'LL YES I'LL GIVE YOU A GUINEA IF YOU WILL LET ME ON

7902-96595-0025 YOU DO NOT KNOW ONE
7975-280057-0000 THESE EFFORTS WERE SOON TO MAKE TROUBLE FOR ME OF WHICH I HAD NEVER DREAMED
7975-280057-0001 HENRY WASHINGTON YOUNGER MY BROTHER REPRESENTED JACKSON COUNTY THREE TIMES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS ALSO A JUDGE OF THE COUNTY COURT
7975-280057-0002 MY MOTHER WHO WAS BESHEBA FROSTEAUX OF INDEPENDENCE WAS A DAUGHTER OF RICHARD FROSTEAUX WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON AT NEW ORLEANS JACKSON COUNTY HAVING BEEN SO NAMED AT MY GRANDFATHER FRISTEAUX'S INSISTENCE
7975-280057-0003 I CANNOT REMEMBER WHEN I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SHUT
7975-280057-0004 MY BROTHER JAMES WAS BORN JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT JOHN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE AND ROBERT IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT
7975-280057-0005 MY ELDEST BROTHER RICHARD DIED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
7975-280057-0006 MY MOTHER WAS IN THE EMPLOY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND HAD THE MAIL CONTRACT FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILES
7975-280057-0007 HE HAD STARTED BACK TO HARRISONVILLE IN HIS BUGGY BUT WAS WAYLAID ONE MILE SOUTH OF WESTPORT A SUBURB OF KANSAS CITY AND BRUTALLY MURDERED FALLING OUT OF HIS BUGGY INTO THE ROAD WITH THREE MORTAL BULLET WOUNDS
7975-280057-0008 MISS WASHINGTON WELLS AND HER SON SAMUEL ON THE ROAD HOME FROM KANSAS CITY TO LEA'S SUMMIT RECOGNIZED THE BODY AS THAT OF MY FATHER
7975-280057-0009 MISS WELLS STAYED TO GUARD THE REMAINS WHILE HER SON CARRIED THE NEWS OF THE MURDER TO COLONEL PEABODY OF THE FEDERAL COMMAND WHICH WAS THEN IN CAMP AT KANSAS CITY
7975-280057-0010 MISS MC CORKELL JUMPED FROM THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE AND DISAPPEARED
7975-280057-0011 AS THE RAIDERS PASSED ONE OF THEM SHOUTED

7975-280057-0013 EVERY KNOT REPRESENTED HER HUMAN LIFE
7975-280057-0014 BUT SHE FAILED TO FIND THE COMFORTS SHE SOUGHT FOR THE ANNOYANCES CONTINUED IN A MORE AGGRAVATED FORM
7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SAME PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED MY HOME IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED OF THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0017 FROM HARRISONVILLE SHE WENT TO WAVERLEY WHENCE SHE WAS HOUNDED CONTINUALLY
7975-280057-0018 ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT AT LESSENTON WEEKLY

7975-280057-0020 WHEN I WAS TAKEN PRISONER I EXPECTED TO BE SHOT WITHOUT EXAMINATION
7975-280063-0000 WE TOOK THE OATH PERHAPS THREE HUNDRED OF US DOWN ON LUTHER MASON'S FARM A FEW MILES FROM WHERE I NOW WRITE WHERE COLONEL HAYNES HAD ENCAMPED AFTER INDEPENDENCE
7975-280063-0001 BOOMER AND MYSELF MET COFFEE AND THE REST BELOW ROSEHILL ON GRAND RIVER
7975-280063-0002 ACCORDINGLY I WAS SHORTLY AWAKENED TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO LOANJOCK WHERE HE WOULD PERSONALLY MAKE KNOWN THE SITUATION TO THE OTHER COLONELS
7975-280063-0003 FOSTER HAD NEARLY ONE THOUSAND CALVER MEN AND TWO PIECES OF RAB'S INDIANA BATTERY THAT HAD ALREADY MADE FOR ITSELF A NAME FOR HARD FIGHTING
7975-280063-0004 COME IN COLONEL HAYES EXCLAIMED COLONEL COCKREEL
7975-280063-0005 I THINK WE'LL BE RATHER TOUGH MEAT FOR BREAKFAST I REPLIED HE MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT FOR DINNER
7975-280063-0006 JACKMAN WITH A PARTY OF THIRTY SEASONED MEN CHARGED THE INDIANA GUNS AND CAPTURED THEM BUT MAJOR FOSTER LED THE GALLANT CHARGE AGAINST THE INVADERS AND RECAPTURED THE PIECES
7975-280063-0007 WE WERE OUT OF AMMUNITION AND WERE HELPLESS HAD THAT FIGHT BEEN PRESSED
7975-280063-0008 HE DID MARK MY CLOTHES IN ONE OR TWO PLACES HOWEVER
7975-280063-0009 MAJOR FOSTER IN A LETTER TO JUDGE GEORGE M HENNET OF MINNEAPOLIS SAID
7975-280063-0010 I WAS TOLD BY SOME OF OUR MEN FROM THE EASTERN BORDER OF THE STATE THAT THEY RECOGNISED THE DARING YOUNG RIDER AS COAL YOUNGER
7975-280063-0011 ABOUT EIGHT THIRTY A M I WAS SHOT DOWN
7975-280063-0012 THE WOUNDED OF BOTH FORCES WERE GATHERED UP AND WERE PLACED ON HOUSES
7975-280076-0000 ALTHOUGH EVERY BOOK PURPORTING TO NARRATE THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS HAS TOLD OF THE LIBERTY ROBBERY AND IMPLIED THAT WE HAD PART IN IT THE YOUNGERS WERE NOT SUSPECTED AT THAT TIME NOR FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNISED AMONG THE ROBBERS ALL SHEPARD RED MARKERS AND BUD PENCE WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUANTRELLE
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAID WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BLOODSHED JUDGE MC CLEAN THE BANKER BEING SHOT IF NOT FATALLY
7975-280076-0003 NO WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGERS FOR SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
7975-280076-0004 JUNE THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE OBENCOCK BROTHERS BANK AT CROYD AND IOWA WAS ROBBED OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BY SEVEN MEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
7975-280076-0005 IT IS CHARGED THAT ARTHUR MAC COY OR A C MC COY AND MYSELF HAD BEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE GAD'S HILL AFFAIR AND THE TWO STAGE ROBBERIES
7975-280076-0006 THE PARTS OF THIS LETTER NOW REPLEVANT ARE AS FOLLOWS
7975-280076-0007 YOU MAY USE THIS METHOD IN YOUR OWN WAY
7975-280076-0008 I WILL GIVE YOU THIS OUTLINE AND SKETCH OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND ACTIONS AND THE TIME OF CERTAIN ROBBERIES WITH WHICH I AM CHARGED
7975-280076-0009 AT THE TIME OF THE GALLETON BANK ROBBERING I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM PLEES TAYLOR AND RECTOR
7975-280076-0010 THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SHERIFF BERKELEY AND OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
7975-280076-0011 I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS TO FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY
7975-280076-0012 I THEN WENT TO ARKANSAS AND RETURNED TO SAINT CLAIR COUNTY AT THE FIRST OF MAY
7975-280076-0013 I WENT TO KANSAS WHERE OUR CATTLE WERE IN WOODSEN COUNTY AT COLONEL RIDGE'S
7975-280076-0014 DURING THE SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS BUT AS THERE WAS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED THAT SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE I AM
7975-280076-0015 I WENT THROUGH INDEPENDENCE AND FROM THERE TO A R WEBBS
7975-280076-0016 THERE I TOOK DINNER AND THEN WENT TO DOCTOR L W TWIMANS'S
7975-280076-0017 OUR BUSINESS SIR WAS TO SEE E P WEST HE WAS NOT AT HOME BUT THE FAMILY WILL REMEMBER THAT WE WERE THERE
7975-280076-0018 WE CROSSED ON THE BRIDGE STAYED IN THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING WE RODE INTO THE CITY
7975-280076-0019 I MEET SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS AMONG THEM WAS BOB HUDSPETH
7975-280076-0020 WE WERE NOT ON GOOD TERMS AT THE TIME NOR HAVE WE BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEAR
7975-280076-0021 POOR JOHN HE HAS BEEN HUNTED DOWN AND SHOT LIKE A WILD BEAST AN NEVER WAS A BOY MORE INNOCENT
7975-280076-0022 DOCTOR N LEWIS WAS HIS PHYSICIAN
7975-280076-0023 THEY WERE FIFTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS THERE WHO WILL TESTIFY IN ANY COURT THAT JOHN AND I WERE THERE
7975-280076-0024 HELVIN FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WAS ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND EITHER OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE ABOVE FOR JOHN AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MISTER SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND WAS IN HIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MISTER AND MISS FICKLE AFTER THE SERVICE
7975-280076-0025 ABOUT THE LAST OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR I ARRIVED IN CARROLL PARRISH LOUISIANA
7975-280076-0026 HE STAYED THERE UNTIL THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
7975-280076-0027 I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THE TIME I WAS AT NEOZIO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAY
7975-280076-0028 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY AT ADAIA IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY
7975-280084-0000 I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED WE SHOULD NOT SHOOT EVERY ONE
7975-280084-0001 WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOODS BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS HE SAW US WENT RIGHT INTO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
7975-280084-0002 WHEN WE COME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
7975-280084-0003 J S ALLING WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
7975-280084-0004 GET YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY' ARE ROBBING THE BANK
7975-280084-0005 AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS AT THE BRIG THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
7975-280084-0006 ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT IN THE NECK
7975-280084-0007 CHADWELL WOOD AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR DEMANDS
7975-280084-0008 IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN YOU
7975-280084-0009 MEANTIME THE STREET WAS BECOMING UNCOMFORTABLY HOT
7975-280084-0010 EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DRAW OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7975-280084-0011 DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UPSTAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DOWN IN THE STREET
7975-280084-0012 CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILLERS'S MARE
7975-280084-0013 WHAT KEPT YOU SO LONG I ASKED PETTS
7975-280084-0014 AS TO THE REST OF THE EFFECT INSIDE THE BANK I TAKE THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0015 WHERE'S THE MONEY OUTSIDE THE SAFE PAPA ASKED
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL FITZ CHASED HIM WITH A BILL
7975-280084-0017 THE FIRST ONE MISSED HIM BUT THE SECOND CAME THROUGH HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
7975-280085-0000 THAT NIGHT IT STARTED TO RAIN AN WE WORE OUT OUR HORSES
7975-280085-0001 FRIDAY WE MOVE TO WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMP BETWEEN ELYSIAN AND GERMAN LAKE
7975-280085-0002 BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARMHOUSE CLOSE TO MANCANO
7975-280085-0003 TO DAY A MAN NAMED DUNNING DISCOVERED US AND WE TOOK HIM PRISONER
7975-280085-0004 FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO TAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE AGREED NOT TO
7975-280085-0005 NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POST HASTE INTO MANCADOR TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
7975-280085-0006 THE WHISTLE ON THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED ON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
7975-280085-0007 HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH A PULLET ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
7975-280085-0008 BUT THEY SOON AFTER GOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM DROVE MY WALKING STICK WITH A SHOT
7975-280085-0009 WE WERE IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG SAWED HORSES AND THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE ANIMALS AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
7975-280085-0010 SIX STEPS TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T O VALT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J CAVISSON
7975-280085-0011 FORMING IN LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE IN THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ROBBERS WERE DISCOVERED
7975-280085-0012 MAKE FOR THE HORSES HE SAID EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
7975-280085-0013 THERE'S NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH A LINE JUST CHARGE THEM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN
7975-280085-0014 I GOT UP AS THE SIGNAL FOR THE CHARGE AND WE FIRED THE VOLLEY
7975-280085-0015 ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELED UPON BOB IN SPITE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS A FLAG OF TRUCE
7975-280085-0016 SHERIFF GLISPIN OF WATTOWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
7975-280085-0017 INCLUDING THOSE RECEIVED IN AND ON THE WAY FROM NORTHWARD I HAD ELEVEN WOUNDS
7975-280085-0018 AND SHERIFF GLISPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTECTORATE OF MINNESOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
8131-117016-0000 HE CAPTAIN MURDOCK
8131-117016-0001 BUT MARSPORT HAD FLOURISHED ENOUGH TO GIVE IT OFF
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THAT TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MEN
8131-117016-0003 THE STONE STALL GANG NUMBERED PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DARELX IN FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORIES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF A MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE SAFE ON PROTECTION RACKETEERS THERE NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THEN HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0007 CAPTAIN MURDOCK WAS AN UNUSUAL FACTOR AND NOW WAS ASKING FOR MORE MEN
8131-117016-0008 THE PRICE WAS ENOUGH TO GET THEM FOR HIM
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE BELIEF
8131-117016-0010 I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS THE WAY WE WOULD ON EARTH
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERY ONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NOT GRAFT
8131-117016-0012 THE FIRST MAN MAKES A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THE STONE WALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
8131-117016-0013 HE PICKED OUT FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FIVE SHALL COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TO NIGHT PICK ANY ROW THAT'S OPEN O K AND LET'S GO
8131-117016-0015 BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCK'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH COTE
8131-117016-0016 A TWO YEARS GORDON ADMITTED
8131-117016-0017 FOR A SECOND GORDON CURSED
8131-117016-0018 HE BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT THE SECURITY THEN
8131-117016-0019 I HAD TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHOR BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES AS OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE CITIZEN WHO WAS DYING WITH LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PRESENCE OF THE FINELY TURNED CLUB IN HIS HANDS
8131-117016-0024 GORDON'S EARS POPPED AT THAT
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWED THE SENTIMENTS HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVING NOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER FOUR COPS HAD COME IN VIOLENTLY
8131-117016-0027 HE RAN HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEYS
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPPI STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0029 TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL THE CABIN
8131-117016-0030 WE'RE NOT USING WAGONS MURDOCK TOLD EM LINE EM UP
8131-117016-0031 IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED QUICKLY
8131-117016-0032 MURDOCK INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING WITH TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS SAD AS GORDON'S FELT
8131-117016-0034 I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY ONE IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD THE MAN
8131-117016-0035 COLONEL THEY'VE KILL ME I DON'T KNOW
8131-117016-0036 MURDOCK TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND WENT TO THE WRETCHED TUFTS
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD COME UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL FIND YOU
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER DAY
8131-117016-0039 MURDOCK SENT ONE OF THE MEN TO PUT UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD
8131-117016-0040 IS THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN WHO'D BEEN BEATEN BEFORE
8131-117016-0041 KEEP A STRETCHER AND TAKE HIM WHEREVER HE BELONGS HE ORDERED
8131-117016-0042 BUT THE KING STIRRED FINALLY SIGHING
8131-117016-0043 NO THE COPSE THEY'RE MAKING ME WE'RE COVERED GORDON
8131-117016-0044 BUT THE STONEWALL GANG IS BACKING NAIN
8131-117016-0045 BUT IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH ON HER
8131-117016-0046 BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED I'VE GOT A YELLOW TICKET AND SECURITY
8131-117016-0047 MURDOK BLINKED HE DROPPED HIS EYES SLOWLY
8131-117016-0048 WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAIN WILL BE RE ELECTION
8131-117016-0049 AND NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER
8131-117016-0050 EVER SEE A MARSHAL ELECTION
8131-117016-0051 NO YOU'RE A FERRESTER HE CAN'T LOSE
8131-117016-0052 AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS WHOLE PLANET BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WHAT THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW AND HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0055 COSTS THEM MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE IZZY IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO WHAT HE SEES IT
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEAS OF THEIR STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
8131-117016-0058 THE GROUPS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCK WAS TRAINING A SMALL SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
8131-117016-0059 IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING WAS EITHER
8131-117016-0060 THESE COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D SEEN ON EARTH
8131-117016-0061 BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAIN WAS RE COLLECTED
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHOGU BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORISED PRECINCT HOUSE
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE JIMMY HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117017-0002 AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HALEY'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117017-0003 GORDON HIT THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MARS SPEAKER LETS OUT A SHRILL WHISTLE
8131-117017-0004 GUNNS SUDDENLY SEEMED TO BE FLOURISHING EVERYWHERE

8131-117017-0012 MUST HAVE BEEN MAKING A GOOD CONTACT IN SOMETHING FIFTY FIFTY
8131-117017-0013 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OVER FOUR THOUSAND CREDITS IN THE WALLET
8131-117017-0014 WHEN GORDON AND JENKINS CAME BACK MURDOCK TOSSED THE MONEY TO THEM SPLITTING

8131-117017-0030 AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COPPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN ISSY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USE THE INFORMATION WITH A LEAD SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT TO THE UPPER BRACKETS HE'D STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS

8188-269288-0028 SHE LOOKED OVER THE ROOM

8188-269288-0033 LISLIE LEFT THE ROOM BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY GONE A DOZEN PACES DOWN THE CORRIDOR BEFORE SHE MET ANOTHER RETURNING
8188-269288-0034 ANNIE'S EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT HER CHEEKS WERE NO LONGER PALE BUT THERE WAS A BRILLIANT COLOR IN THEM

8188-269288-0050 CERTAINLY SITED EASILY
8188-269288-0051 SHE TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND LIT A CANDLE WHICH SHE PUT BEHIND HER SCREEN THEN PREPARED TO GET IN BED
8188-269288-0052 ANNIE'S MARRIAGE WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS

8188-269290-0033 BUT MARJORY AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LISLIE AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
8188-269290-0034 MISS LAUDERDALE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHER TUTORS AND PUPILS OF THE DIFFERENT HALLS ON A RAISED PLATFORM
8188-269290-0035 THEN A BROAD CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE WAS ANY COLCHESTER
8188-269290-0036 THE PHYSICAL PART OF YOUR TRAINING AND ALSO THE MENTAL PART ARE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED IN THIS GREAT HOUSE OF LEARNING SHE CONTINUED BUT THE SPIRITUAL PART IT SEEMS TO ME OUGHT NEVER TO BE STRENGTHENED
8188-269290-0037 HER HERE AND ONCE AGAIN HERE
8188-269290-0038 SHE UTTERED HER SWEET REMARK STANDING UP
8188-269290-0039 MARGERY AND EILEEN CAME CLOSE TO HER
8188-269290-0040 I WILL TALK WITH YOU BELLE CARTERSON PRESENTLY SHE SAID
8188-269290-0041 THE NAMES OF THE PROPOSED MEMBERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO ME BEFORE THIS TIME WEEK
8188-269290-0042 AM I MY FRIEND'S KEEPER
8188-269290-0043 WHAT YOU ASK SHE CONTINUED
8188-269290-0044 GOD ANSWERS TO EACH OF YOU YOU ARE RIGHT
8188-269290-0045 THE WORLD SAYS NO I HAVE NOT BUT GOD SAYS YES YOU ARE
8188-269290-0046 ALL THESE ARE YOUR BROTHERS
8188-269290-0047 FOR ALL WHOSE SIN ALL WHO SUFFER YOU ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RESPONSIBLE
8188-269290-0048 AFTER THE ATTACK THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
8188-269290-0049 IT WAS PAST TEN O'CLOCK WHEN SHE LEFT THAT HALL
8188-269290-0050 JUST AS SHE WAS DOING SO A MISS FRERE CAME UP
8188-269290-0051 ENIE COLCHESTER IS YOUR ROOMFELLOW IS SHE NOT SHE SAID
8188-269290-0052 I SEE BY YOUR FACE MISSUS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DISTRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING ARE YOU KEEPING EVERYTHING BACK
8188-269290-0053 I'M AFRAID I AM REPLIED LIZZIE DISTRESSED IN HER TONE
8188-269290-0054 I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS LARKDALE EXCEPT A VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED HERSELF
8188-269290-0055 EXCUSES MAKE SOME DIFFERENCE
8188-269290-0056 THE GIRL WHO BREAKS A RULES HAS TO BE PUNISHED
8188-269290-0057 I WILL HELP HER
8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO BEFORE THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO ITS CARE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MONTMERS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICIALS OF THE ARMY FOUND A CRIME TO BE CAPITAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0004 FOR THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER IT
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW A FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME FOR MYSELF
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION AWAKE THOSE SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UP A COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVE LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WORLD FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0007 HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE CONWEALTH
8188-274364-0008 MY LORDS I HAVE NOW TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIPS A DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG VANE FALLING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THE MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO PIM WHO NOW BROUGHT THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES A DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSENED FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT
8280-266249-0000 LITTLE MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0001 AS THEY ARE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL LOOKED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOR
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE NIGHT HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0004 THERE ARE SOME NICE YOUNG PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0005 BESIDES OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RONALT LAUGHING
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ANSWERED THAT LITTLE GROUP YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE OR CHILD I SUPPOSE
8280-266249-0007 THEN WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR HERALD I SHOULD JUDGE
8280-266249-0008 DO YOU ANSWER WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009 HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE OLD BOY
8280-266249-0010 SAYS YOU AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRANK
8280-266249-0011 I DO INDEED THOUGH PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF MY AILMENTS
8280-266249-0012 NEVERTHELESS THAT IS THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE WOMAN'S CABIN WHERE THERE'S A LIGHT
8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL LAUGHING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT OF TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF A DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED ON THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THIRTY MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0017 IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILS
8280-266249-0018 THAT THE RICH POLYTECHNICA INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS UPON THE MIND
8280-266249-0019 NOTICES THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEWERS
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CANNOT MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0021 AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DO NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0022 HENCE OUR RESORT TO CIDER AND BEER
8280-266249-0023 NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAD OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN
8280-266249-0024 THAT YE ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GODS
8280-266249-0025 THEY CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR BODIES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT WE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE WHOLLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF ITS INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALEY
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LOLBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND NOT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHER ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0030 THEY ARE GAMBLING YONDER AND I' AM AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0031 THE HANDS OF THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION
8280-266249-0032 NO SIR HE IS NOW HERE
8280-266249-0033 THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TO
8280-266249-0034 NOW THIS VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0035 HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THIS MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING TO HIS STATEROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0036 WHERE DOES IT MEAN CRIED ONE
8280-266249-0037 A VENTRILOQUISTLY BOARD OF COURSE RETURNED ANOTHER LET'S FOLLOW AND SEE THE FUN
8280-266249-0038 I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REMARKED THE OTHER LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT COME ON
8280-266249-0039 THAT FELLOW NICK WARD IS A NOTED BLACKG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE
8280-266249-0040 WHO ASKED THE MATE I'VE SEEN NOT ONE UP HERE THOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THE STEERAGE
8280-266249-0041 THEY HELD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8280-266249-0042 A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE LANDLORD IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0043 LET ME DROP YELLED WARD MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIS ARMS
8280-266249-0044 I DINKS NO I TINKS I DID YOU VON LASSIN RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
8280-266249-0045 THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS OF IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0046 MISTER LILBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRY TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0047 YET THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL MEMBERS OF HIS PROFESSION
8280-266249-0048 THEY KEPT THIS UP TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT
8280-266249-0049 THEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM THIS FIRST SLEEP IN HIS STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0050 AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A FULL ONE AND THE STAKES WERE VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0051 THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREEN BACKS THAT LAY BENEATH THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THAT DREADFUL SOUND
8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL TO SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS WITH A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
8280-266249-0054 IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED WARD LOOK WHAT'S THERE LOOK YOU
8280-266249-0055 WHAT CAN IT HAV BEEN THEY ASKED EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0056 OH NONSENSE HOW FOOLS WE ARE
8280-266249-0057 IT WAS THEIR LAST GAME OF CARDS FOR THAT TRIP
8280-266249-0058 A CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0059 TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DAILIES WERE IN VERY STRAITENT CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0060 OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES FOR THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE

8280-266249-0062 ELSIE ANSWERED PRESSING HER HAND AFFECTIONATELY ARE YOU NOT SISTERS IN CHRIST
8280-266249-0063 HERE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD BY FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS

8280-266249-0065 WE FEEL MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE ARE ONLY THE STEWARDS OF HIS BOUNTY AND BECAUSE HE HAS SAID INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME IT WAS THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE AND DELIGHT TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIS PEOPLE
8461-258277-0000 WHEN IT WAS THIS SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTEENTH NIGHT
8461-258277-0001 BUT HE ANSWERED NEEDS MUST THOU HAVE ZANNAB LL SAY NOW SUDDENLY THERE CAME A RAP AT THE DOOR AND THE MAID SAID WHO IS AT THE DOOR

8461-258277-0003 REPLIED THE BROKER'S DAUGHTER O THOU DAUGHTER OF A GOD

8461-258277-0005 AND SHE THREW DOWN THE JEW'S HEAD BEFORE IT
8461-258277-0006 NOW THE COST OF HER SLAYING HER SIRE WAS AS FOLLOWS
8461-258277-0007 THEN HE SET OUT REJOICING TO REPAIR TO THE BARRACK OF THE FORTY

8461-258277-0015 SO ALI RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT HAD PASSED FROM FIRST TO LAST AND THE CALIPH SAID I HAD NOT THOUGHT THAT THOU WOULDST KILL HIM FOR THAT HE WAS A SORCERER
8461-258277-0016 HE REPLIED I HAVE HAD FORTY LADS BUT THEY ARE IN CAIRO
8461-278226-0000 AND HONOR HAD HER OWN PET PLANS
8461-278226-0001 SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED A SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WEAR THE NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JEVIN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTORISE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-278226-0003 I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES THE COMMON PICTURES ESPECIALLY
8461-278226-0004 I REMEMBER ALL THE REUBENS SAYS AT THE LOUVRE WHERE I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
8461-278226-0005 SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH PEARL GREY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOLS AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AYESHA BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0006 IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY FOR FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0007 BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN IN THIS GALLERY
8461-278226-0008 PHILIP JOSCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HIS WIFE MADE A DISCOVERY
8461-278226-0009 HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE PHILIP AND LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
8461-278226-0010 I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MOURNING ROOM AT JOCELYN STROKE
8461-278226-0011 SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH COUNTESS PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KIRSTO LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
8461-278226-0012 THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF OF THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF LIFE
8461-278226-0013 BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE'S STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARD THE WORKS OF OTHERS
8461-278226-0014 I DON'T THINK YOU WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HOUSES
8461-278226-0015 YOU' WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOUR PHILIP IF YOU'LL SAY YES
8461-281231-0000 HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE SHE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THE WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS
8461-281231-0001 IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORKALESTONE
8461-281231-0002 AS HE LAY ON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH THE FEARS OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
8461-281231-0003 WHAT ART THOU HE EXCLAIMED IN PRAYER
8461-281231-0004 LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH EUREKA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTED THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
8461-281231-0005 EXCLAIMED THE NORMAN HE

8461-281231-0007 THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID EURICAS AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO WOULD EXTINGUISH THEM
8461-281231-0008 MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THAT CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
8461-281231-0009 THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY THE LACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
8461-281231-0010 THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCED THIS WAY INWARD IN DESPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
8461-281231-0011 TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEIR LEADERS'S EFFORTS TO STOP THEM
8461-281231-0012 THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE ROMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL WRUNG WITH THE FURIOUS BLOWS
8461-281231-0013 AT LENGTH DE BARCY FELL
8461-281231-0014 TELL ME THY NAME O WORK THY PLEASURE ON ME
8461-281231-0015 YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS THEE TO SEE
8461-281231-0016 EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER AND PERISHE
8461-281231-0017 THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS TEMPER
8461-281231-0018 RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH THESE THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURTHEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF OTHER PRISONERS
8461-281231-0019 BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THE BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT FROM DE BOEUF
8461-281231-0020 AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE ULRICA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
8461-281231-0021 BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND ROSE THROUGH THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY AS TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTERS
8461-281231-0022 AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED HER GIANT
8461-281231-0023 WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TONKELESTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
8461-281231-0024 HE LEFT A GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF KOENIGSBERG AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ADDLESTEIN WAS LAID
8461-281231-0025 DE BRECY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOOD
8461-281231-0026 HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP THAT AS A MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING
8461-281231-0027 SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS STRONG WAR HORSE AND RODE OFF TOWARD THE FOREST
8461-281231-0028 DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER PHILIP
8461-281231-0029 BUT WITH THIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
8461-281231-0030 THIS TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FROM DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
8461-281231-0031 HE APPEALED TO A BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
8461-281231-0032 BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LYCAS DE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON HIS VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY
8461-281231-0033 HE HAD NOT TILL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONG THEM
8461-281231-0034 POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM HIS PRECEPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THE AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK ROUND AND TO MARK INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
8461-281231-0036 SHE GAZED THOUGHTFULLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
8461-281231-0037 AT HIS FEET WAS PLACED A TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
8461-281231-0038 THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOURTEEN PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THEIR SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
