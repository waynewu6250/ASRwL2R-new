I WILL MAKE THAT YOUR SPECIAL BUSINESS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0130)
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT DISHESS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0000)
THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THAT SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0001)
FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED OR BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0002)
BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0003)
IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB FORWARD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0004)
LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE GRADUALLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0005)
IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHILE SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0006)
BEFORE SUGAR WERE IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0007)
I FOURTEEN NINETY NINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0008)
BOIL HIM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0009)
THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN CAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0010)
FROM THIS ACCOUNT THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0011)
THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN A STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE CHANGED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0012)
IN THIS WAY IT IS SO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0013)
MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTE WERE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0014)
MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES A PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0015)
THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O EIGHT	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0016)
IN ALL THE PREPARATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0017)
CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN TO EIGHT	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0018)
IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONVERCET TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0019)
THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER IF THEY CAN NOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0020)
HOWEVER AS LATE AS IN THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0021)
THE SHAPE OF THE FISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHIONS AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0022)
ISIS IS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0023)
AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME OTHER EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0024)
THE SPATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT WHITE AND CLEAN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0025)
THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THIS PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0026)
THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON OR A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0000)
FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT IT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0001)
BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL IN HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0002)
KISS ME YOU GIRL SAID THE HEAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0003)
AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE WAS TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0004)
THAT YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0005)
AT THE LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0006)
WELL IF MY BROTHER SAY SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0007)
WHAT IS MY SISTER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0008)
ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO LIVED THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0009)
SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED UPON IT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0010)
OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BIRD SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0011)
AND I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0012)
THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE CHILD OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0013)
NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS AS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0014)
WILT THOU SPARE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS ASKED THE KING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0000)
THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE CLOTHES AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0001)
HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE OF THE EVENING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0002)
YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE QUEEN	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0003)
HE HAD GONE DOWN ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0004)
THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BRETHREN	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0005)
WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTIFF WHEN SHE CALLED TO HIM	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0006)
GO HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0007)
THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOILS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0008)
SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING THIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0009)
ON THE THIRD DAY SYBBA LAD WANTED TO SET OUT	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0010)
THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CLINDER LADD SET OUT ON HIS WAY	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0011)
I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID SINDER SAD	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0012)
I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDER LAD	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0013)
AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED INWARDS A LONG LONG WAY	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0014)

IT LIVES LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0017)
SINDERLAS TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0018)

WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A GOOD LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0020)
AND NOW ENQUIRED THE FOX SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0021)
NOW THEN SAID THE FOLE DOST THOU NOT SEE ANY THING NOW	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0022)

I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDERABAD	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0024)
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD BEEN MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0000)
THE OLD KING WENT OVER AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0001)
BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED IF HE MIGHT BE HEALED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0002)
SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THIS MORNING AND SHE SAID	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0003)
NOW THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0004)
HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WILL NOT FEAR HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0005)
THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER RAN DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0006)
ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORN AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0007)
SO ROGAN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0008)
THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HER FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0009)
SO SIGURD SAID THAT STORY WOULD DO	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0010)
THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHILE HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0011)
BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT THROUGH HIS VERY HEART	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0012)
SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF IN LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0013)
BUT ALL MEN DIE AND SOME BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0014)
DIE THOU FAFNERER AND THEN STAFFNER DIED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0015)
THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFNER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF THAT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0016)
SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFKNER ON A STEAK AND ROASTED IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0017)
WHERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0018)
THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HIVENFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINHILD SLEEPS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0019)
THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS IN BREAKING	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0020)
THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0021)
THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO A HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0022)
LYN BENHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT A FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0023)
FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUNDRAN WERE BATHING BRUNHILD WADED FURTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRON'S SUPERIOR	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0024)
FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE VALLEY WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0025)
NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILT NOT LIVE LONG WHERE I AM DEAD	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0026)

THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSINS THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN	(367-130732-367-130732-0003)

WE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0011)
THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS FEET COULD CARRY HIM	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0012)
THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS MISERABLE SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0013)
HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS BEAUTY	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0014)
A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THIS KEYHOLE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0015)
THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSERS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0016)
AS HE UTTERED THOSE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0017)
IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAVE CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0018)
WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHED ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0019)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PRESIDENT	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0020)
MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED SHALL WE ALL STARVE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0021)
THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHT AWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0022)
TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND THE KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0023)
AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIG'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0024)
BUT ETHELRILD HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0025)
SO THEY ALL CALLED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE ISOULT	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0026)
HE FEEL WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0000)
HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A WIFE MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0001)
HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AS HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0002)
TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IT IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0003)
MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REMEMBERED THE TRUE LIGHT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0004)
THE HALF LIGHTS OF A DOUBT PAINED HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0005)
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THAT HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0006)
HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM MY FATHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0007)
HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE MISFORTUNES WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0008)
IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF A CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0009)
THEY HAD SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0010)
REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TO TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0011)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAIS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0012)
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I MAY NOT KNOW	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0013)
SILVER GOLD TOO IT IS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0014)
YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A CAKE AND MY BOOTS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0015)
THAT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0016)
NO IT IS NOT GOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0017)
DO YOU KNOW GERMAN NO I	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0018)
THIS IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0019)
THEIR CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0020)
HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THEIR CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0021)
HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FOUR FRANCS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0022)
HULLO I HAD FORGOT THAT SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0023)
THE LANDLORD FINISHED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0024)
I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MORIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0025)
I WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0026)
ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIXTY HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0027)
MARIE SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0028)
FROM THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0029)
HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT A PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0000)
BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PURSES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0001)
THE COUNTESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0002)
WELL DOCTOR TO DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0003)
IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY AND HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0004)
AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT A SIGH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0005)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY LISTENED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0006)
AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALLEUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0007)
THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PHILOSOPHY WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0008)
YES THAT'S AN UNEXPECTED THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0009)
BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKI BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE YOU ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0010)
HE ASKED AFTER IT IS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0011)
OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT INTO TWENTY MINUTES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0012)
AND HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0013)
WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH FOR LOWERING THEM	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0014)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTLESSLY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0015)
BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL TO CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0016)
AND THEN OUR MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0017)
AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE TO LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0018)
OH TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOORWAY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0019)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE HOPED TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0020)
OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS HIMSELF COME THIS WAY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0021)
AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM INTO KITTY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0022)
WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEAR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0023)
SHE HAD ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0024)
EXCUSE ME MASTER BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0025)
WHICH IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0026)
YOUR CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0027)
NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD NOT FINISHED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0028)
AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCES AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0029)
AT THE FIRST SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0030)
FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN SOME NEED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0031)
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD GONE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0032)
HER MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KATY PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARFUL	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0033)
EDUCATED PEOPLE AND THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0000)
THIS IT IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0001)
IN THE SOCIAL CONNECTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTEREST OF THE GROUP	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0002)
THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS DISTINCTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0003)
THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DELIGHTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0004)
THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0005)
THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS PRESENTED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0006)
THIS BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0007)
THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL ARE THE BASIS OF POWER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0008)
POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND SHORT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0009)
INDEED IT IS COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0010)
ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BECOME JUSTIFIED	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0011)
BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN AND POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THIS SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0012)
EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO SUSTAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0013)
BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEM EVEN MORE SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0014)
IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE WITH CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0015)
AFTER CONQUEST THE POWERS OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0016)
BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN POPULAR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0017)
INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY ON THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0018)
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SURPASS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0019)
AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LEVEL BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0020)
THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF THE ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0021)
SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0022)
FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN DESPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0023)
THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FELT THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0024)
THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED IN THE FRONTIERS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0025)
THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS WHO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0026)
AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS CONTAINED BY THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0027)
BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS WITH VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0028)
AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY AND ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0029)
THE INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0030)
EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THE ARMIES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0031)
THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ONLY INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0032)
THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES BY CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0033)
AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM THE CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0034)
THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0035)
IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF OR THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0036)
BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE TRIALS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0037)
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT WE EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0038)
THE TAXES RAISED ON THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0039)
THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF MEN'S SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0040)
BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0041)
GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSES BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0042)
THEY ARE NEEDED PHYSICALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0043)
AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING ROOM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0044)
I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING WHICH CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0045)
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSON IN OUR OWN COUNTRY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0046)
WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY THE CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0047)
SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NAME	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0048)
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGIONS EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0049)
WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THEIR SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0050)
THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED TILL SOME CENTURIES AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0051)
THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND MEDICAL OBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0052)
WITHOUT ARGUMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0053)
THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES WHICH MIGHT ENSLAVE US	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0054)
AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE HUNDREDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0055)
THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER FROM SUCH ATTACKS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0056)
EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL OF THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0057)
TO RESIST SHOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0058)
SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS IN OPPRESSOR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0059)
FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANCES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0060)
WHY YOU KNOW SOMETHING	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0000)

O K HE CRIED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0003)
ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HIM YOURSELF	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0004)
MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT ON EM'S STREET	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0005)
NOW HE ADMITTED I DID	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0006)
CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT WHICH HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0007)
THINK IF HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0008)
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF SEEING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0009)
MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED IT AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0010)
BITCH HE AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED TO HIM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0011)
MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE ROAD	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0012)
AY SHUCKS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0013)
CHRIS STARTED OUT ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0014)
AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN TOO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0015)
THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK AT THE BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON TO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOCH SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0016)
A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GREY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TREMBLED ABOVE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0017)
THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THE SHOP	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0018)
ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS IN EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0019)
AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE PASSED THE HOUSE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0020)
THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTING PIECES	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0021)
ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREAT GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATURE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0022)
BUT THE NAMES STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELL	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0023)
HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP AND HE THOUGHT OF IT	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0024)
HOW THEN DID HE LOOK AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0025)
A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOKEN FROM ITS DREAM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0026)
OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIPS AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0000)
SO NOW ALONE AND TILL SOME ONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0001)
WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WERE SOMBRE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0002)
THE HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0003)
MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIST COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0004)
THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THEIR HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0005)
LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE YOUNG MAN'S EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0006)
CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN WELL THEY WERE STILL THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0007)
CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICES CAME BACK TO HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0008)
YET SIR HE SAID	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0009)
I SAW YOUR DESIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0010)
HE'S HIS SCHOOLMATE OF MINE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0011)
JAKI HARRIS'S NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS A JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0012)
I I JUST WONDERED IF THE BRICE WAS STILL OPEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0013)
WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOUR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS HANDS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0014)
HE GUESSED THERE WAS MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0015)
WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIEGGS GETTING THE JOB SIR	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0016)
BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALNUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARDS THE THAPHIC SIGNALS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0017)
THE ROOM IT SEEMED OVERLY STILL	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0018)
THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ROUND	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0019)
THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM AND THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0020)
ACROSS THE WATER WHERE IS THE FREE SIDE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0021)
IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WITH THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKE STACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0022)
THIS WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0023)
FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EACH DIRECTION	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0024)
NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLIT LEAVES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0025)
WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0026)
THE COURTYARD WAS SEVERALLY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0027)
THEIR POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0028)
THE COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLANED COURTYARD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0029)
THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF IN THE STABLE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0030)
MY WINDOW HAS THAT POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0031)
THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS READY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0000)
HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACE FOR IT	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0001)
CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF A TASK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0002)
ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOOK WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0003)
WHAT SHOULD AN ALLY DO FIRST	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0004)
HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANYTHING	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0005)
SUPPOSE I CHANCE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0006)
MISTER WORKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET HIS COURAGE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0007)
THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER BIGGER SAID START AT ONCE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0008)
AND SENSATIONS SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0009)
HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINTLY A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0010)
HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT IS BY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0011)
SEVENTY FOUR PAGE ONE THE RETURN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0012)
THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE HAD CURVED AT POINTING TOES	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0013)
THAT ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0014)
IF IT WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0015)
HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALONE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0016)
BUT HOW DID ONE TAKE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0017)
CHRIS GOT UP AND STOOD BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0018)
HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY HE RETURNED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0019)
THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE HAD INCREASED IN STORM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0020)
DUST CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE HER TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0021)
CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED ON THE PROPER TIME	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0022)
MISTER WORKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKE AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCIANS FUMED AND GLOWED	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0023)
WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THIS NEGRO BOY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0024)
IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED IT	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0025)
UNDER HIS EYES THE WIDENING FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0026)
THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE LONG BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET THE BOUQUET FALL	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0027)
THEY CAME DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0000)
GUESS MISTER FINLEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0001)
NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ELEANOR JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0002)
IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE IN I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0003)
THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHTI	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0004)
WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON THIS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0005)
CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING OUT TO HIS CABIN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0006)
CERT'NY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0007)
MISTER FINIS WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0008)
HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO NOT DO AS A ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0009)
THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERINGLY	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0010)
THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR THAT I CANNOT SAY I DO	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0011)
THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN LIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0012)
HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HER	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0013)
WE SHALL SAY NO MORE AND I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0014)
THIS SHIP IS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0015)
YES YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SIR	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0016)
CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN AN WINNING SMILE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0017)
HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE IS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0018)
CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME THAT UNDERSTOOD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0019)
WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS OFFERED TO ASK	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0020)
I'M SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND CREW KNOW IT	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0021)
I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN COME FOR YOU	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0022)
NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER PARKER HAD CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0023)
HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTION HE ACCOUNTED FOR	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0024)
YOUR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0025)
IN CHURCHYARDS YAN	(533-1066-533-1066-0000)
I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FRUIT	(533-1066-533-1066-0001)
I'M SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEMED TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT	(533-1066-533-1066-0002)
FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL INTO THE LODGE	(533-1066-533-1066-0003)
OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOALTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES	(533-1066-533-1066-0004)
MISS INANS HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TO NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0005)
I HAVE NONE SHE SAID HAPPILY	(533-1066-533-1066-0006)
I SAY HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL	(533-1066-533-1066-0007)
THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF IT WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0008)
SOMETHING IS GOIN TO OCCUR HE SAID	(533-1066-533-1066-0009)
PUT ON THE HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING	(533-1066-533-1066-0010)
LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED DOWN MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0011)
THEY WERE TALKING COFIXENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED	(533-1066-533-1066-0012)
THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH A FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0013)
I SAYS NO QUESTIONS	(533-1066-533-1066-0014)
ONCE ONLY EVERYBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STUART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE	(533-1066-533-1066-0015)
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I ASKED	(533-1066-533-1066-0016)
THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHEN SHE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT	(533-1066-533-1066-0017)
I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A MISERABLE SPOT	(533-1066-533-1066-0018)
SO IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN SHARPLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0019)
IT WAS ALEXA ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES	(533-1066-533-1066-0020)
THE DOCTOR KEPT A KEEN LOOK OUT FOR NO ONE APPEARED	(533-1066-533-1066-0021)
THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF MY COMPLICITY	(533-1066-533-1066-0022)
A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING THEM UP	(533-1066-533-1066-0023)
I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT IN AND LOOKED DOWN	(533-1066-533-1066-0024)
BUT HOW AM I TO GO OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY GO	(533-131556-533-131556-0000)
FOR NONE COULD ENDURE ME AS HE HAS DONE OR	(533-131556-533-131556-0001)
THE MOMENT STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM	(533-131556-533-131556-0002)
I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSTAIN HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED	(533-131556-533-131556-0003)
I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD THEM SO MINUTE	(533-131556-533-131556-0004)
THEY HAD TAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOKS	(533-131556-533-131556-0005)
I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE OPINION OF IT	(533-131556-533-131556-0006)
UPON PERUSING THIS SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP OH	(533-131556-533-131556-0007)
YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND SHE'LL FOLLOW AT A WHILE MILICENT WENT	(533-131556-533-131556-0008)
WON'T OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE	(533-131556-533-131556-0009)
COME YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS	(533-131556-533-131556-0010)
IF WE WERE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE	(533-131556-533-131556-0011)
I ENJOY A MOUNTAIN RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THE THRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESORTS	(533-131556-533-131556-0012)
SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER CHEEKS AND GAZING IN THE FIRE	(533-131556-533-131556-0013)
I WATCHED HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY	(533-131556-533-131556-0014)
YES YES IT	(533-131556-533-131556-0015)
SUPPOSE I DIE	(533-131556-533-131556-0016)
SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT ASK	(533-131556-533-131556-0017)

HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLORO'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0009)

TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS THE REFRESHMENT BAR	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0011)

HERE YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BAQ	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0023)
YOU'M MARRIED I HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0024)

WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR PUNGS FOR TIMBER	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0027)
SAID LEVIN RETURNING INTO A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0028)
THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT NOW OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0029)
THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM AND SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0030)
WITHOUT A RETURN TOO WITH A SIMPLE LOSS	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0031)
WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLAS VISITED HIM AGAIN	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0000)
BUT HERMIONN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANER	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0001)
SHE WOULD BEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0002)
SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS IDEA	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0003)
A BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0004)

SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUED DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTILUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0006)
HER APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0007)
