GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT TIES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0000)
THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE FORCE THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0001)
FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE WITH PRESERVES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0002)
BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND A CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0003)
IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB AND TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0004)
LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM IT HAS RISEN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0005)
IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0006)
BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF SUGAR CANE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0007)
FOURTEEN NINETY NINTH	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0008)
BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH THING AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0009)
THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO A EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0010)
FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING TRUTHS BY SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0011)
THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR IRON ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0012)
IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE OR LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0013)
MARMALADES JAMMS AND FRUIT PASTE ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0014)
MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0015)
THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O SEVEN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0016)
IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS A JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0017)
CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN O SEVEN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0018)
IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFERCEE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0019)
THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORNED THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER AND THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0020)
HOWEVER AS LATELY AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0021)
THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES IN DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0022)
ANIS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0023)
AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE TO BE DISPENSED WITH	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0024)
THE SPATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT STRAIGHT AND CLEAN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0025)
THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0026)
HERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0000)
FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE YOUNG WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0001)
BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FEARED WORSE AND WORSE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0002)
KISS ME DEAR SAID THE HEAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0003)
AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT BUT THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0004)
THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE PRINCE'S PALACE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0005)
AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT O LAND	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0006)
WELL IF MY BROTHER DOES SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0007)
WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASK HIS SISTER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0008)
ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED HER KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0009)
SHE MOVED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0010)
OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY FATHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0011)
I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID I	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0012)
THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG ABOUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0013)
NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND MAKE A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0014)
WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS AS THE KING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0000)
THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE COALS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0001)
HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME IN HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0002)
YES THIS I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0003)
HE HAD GONE OUT OFTEN TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0004)
THEN THE KING CAUSED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0005)
WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE THE OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTIFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0006)

THE LITTLE KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0001)

SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING BUT SHE SAID	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0003)
THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND USE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0004)
HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER RAVENS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0005)
THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THAT TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0006)
ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0007)
SO REGAN MADE A WORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0008)
THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLANKET AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0009)
SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0010)
NOW HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0011)

SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF YOU IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0013)
BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS PLEASURE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0014)
DIE THOU FAFFNER AND THEN STEFNER DIED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0015)
THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAUGHNER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0016)
AND SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNER ON A STEAK AND ROASTED IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0017)
THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER ONE HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0018)
THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINSFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINHILD SLEEPS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0019)

LYN BRENHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAMES IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0023)

THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT THE PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0013)
THEY LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS FREEDOM	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0014)
A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT FROM THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYHOLE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0015)
THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY OF THE SCISSORS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0016)
AS HE ADDED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0017)
IN A VERY SHORT TIME A PRINCE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0018)
WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING ROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARMS FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0019)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME ASKED THE POOR PEASANT	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0020)
MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT AND THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0021)
THE GREAT DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0022)
TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRES	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0023)
AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIDY'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0024)
BUT ETHELRIED HEEDING NOT THEIR TAUNTS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0025)
SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE ISO'T	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0026)
HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY RISE LATER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0000)
HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED THAT FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0001)
HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NO DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0002)
TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT BLACK SOULS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0003)
MARIUS WAS CLEAN EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0004)
THAT HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0005)
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FORWARD	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0006)
HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THEIR FATHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0007)
HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THESE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0008)
IN A TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0009)
THEY SOON DEVELOPED HIM ABRUPTLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0010)
REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH HIM SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0011)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRACS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0012)
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW OF	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0013)
SILVER GOLD HERE I IS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0014)
YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND NO BOOTS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0015)
YOU WILL BE ENOUGH	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0016)
NO THAT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0017)
BUT YOU KNOW GERMAN NO	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0018)
IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE ON IT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0019)
THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR AND	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0020)
HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THAT CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0021)
HE BOUGHT HIS WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0022)
HALLO I'VE FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0023)
THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HE HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0024)
I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0025)
THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A THING VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0026)
ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT WAS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0027)
MARIUS SENT BACK THAT THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0028)
AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE HANDS LEFT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0029)
HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN BUT THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0000)
BEFORE HER THEY DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0001)
THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST ITALY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0002)
WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCE TELL ME EVERYTHING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0003)
IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTIONS WELL DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0004)
AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OVER WITH A SIGH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0005)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0006)
AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALCUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0007)
THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF THIS TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0008)
YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THIS CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0009)
BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKI BRIDGE GONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0010)
YOU ASKED AH IT IS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0011)
OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN FORTY MINUTES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0012)
AND HOW OUT THE TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0013)
WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH BY LOWERING IT	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0014)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR LOOKED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0015)
BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVELS I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0016)
AND WHEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0017)
I AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0018)
WHY TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0019)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCE AS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0020)
OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PERHAPS COME THIS WAY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0021)
AND MY MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0022)
WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME OUT SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0023)
SHE ANSWERED HIM AND I AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0024)
EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO SUBJECT IN THIS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0025)
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THINGS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0026)
THE CELEBRATED CAPTAIN DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0027)
NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD NOTICED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0028)
AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0029)
AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY COME ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0030)
FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED WE WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0031)
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD DIED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0032)
THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTERS AND KATY PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARFUL	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0033)
EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THEIR EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0000)
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCOURRECT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0001)
IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTEREST FOR THE INTERESTS OF A GROUP	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0002)
THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONVICTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0003)
THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIGNS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0004)
THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS IN BODILY VIOLENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0005)
THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO A WILL	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0006)
THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE A ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0007)
THE ARMY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0008)
POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0009)
THEN IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0010)
ONLY UNDER SOME CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0011)
BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER IS NO JUSTIFICATION	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0012)
EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE WHICH THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0013)
BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS SEEMED STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMED EVEN MORE SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0014)
IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONTRAST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0015)
AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONSTITUTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0016)
BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NOW MORE THAN TEMPORARY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0017)
INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO A DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0018)
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES TO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0019)
AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FARTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CAN NOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0020)
THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCHS WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0021)
SO IT HAS ALWAYS DONE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0022)
FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF SOCIETY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0023)
THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF TWENTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0024)
THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TODAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THEIR RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0025)
THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS WERE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0026)
AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE COMPANY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0027)
BUT THERE IS NO ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0028)
AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY OFFICER TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0029)
THE INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0030)
EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBOURING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE OF THEIR ARMIES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0031)
THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY OR ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0032)
THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0033)
AND BY THIS MEANS ALL SYSTEMS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0034)
THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN INDIVIDUAL MILITARY SERVICE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0035)
IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS IN THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0036)
BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MAN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0037)
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THESE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBOURS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0038)
THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBS THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0039)
THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF THE LIFE'S SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0040)
BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF A CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0041)
GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCES BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0042)
THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THEIR CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0043)
AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT IS I MAKING THEM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0044)
I AM HAPPY FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0045)
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRIES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0046)
WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS NOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0047)
SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD A FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0048)
EXCEPT OF THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0049)
WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0050)
THIS ARRANGEMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0051)
THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE THEM COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0052)
WITHOUT GOVERNMENT THE NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBOURS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0053)
THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH THEIR ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0054)
AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0055)
THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBOURS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGERS OF SUCH ATTACKS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0056)
EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE PARTY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0057)
TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOW CAPABLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0058)
SO MUCH FROM THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSOR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0059)
FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0060)
SAY YOU HAVE SOMETHING	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0000)
CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO THE CARJACK AND SPARK PLUG	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0001)
KNOW WHO NEEDS THE JOB MAN THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0002)
O K HE ANSWERED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0003)
ONLY WHY COULDN'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0004)
MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN EMMY STREET	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0005)
WELL HE HAD ADMITTED I DID	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0006)
CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHOUT HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0007)
THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE RESUMED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0008)
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FROM JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0009)
MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0010)
BITCHAR AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED TO HIM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0011)
MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE BOARD	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0012)
ON SHUCKS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0013)
CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER VICKER'S HOUSE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0014)
AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISSUS WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0015)
THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK OF A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0016)
A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND RED CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0017)
THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND PETER DECIDED TO FINISH THE JOB	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0018)
ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED THEMSELVES	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0019)
AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE HAD REACHED THE HOUSE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0020)
THERE WERE MANY THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0021)
ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATURE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0022)
BUT THE NAMES STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME RUTH SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0023)
HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE COME INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0024)
HOW THEN DOES HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0025)
A SUDDEN COHORN WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0026)
OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHEEP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0000)
SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOME ONE SHOULD ANSWER THAT BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0001)
WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW IN THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THAT LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0002)
HEAVY MAN HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0003)
MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS DID NOT SEE HIS FACE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0004)
THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OF THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0005)
LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZS ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0006)
CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN OH YES THEY WERE STILL THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0007)
CHRIST SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0008)
HERE SIR HE SAID	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0009)
I SAW YOUR SIGN BUT I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0010)
HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE OWN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0011)
JAE HARRIS'S NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0012)
I I JUST WONDERED IF THE BLOCK WAS STILL OPEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0013)
WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR SIXTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOUR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0014)
WE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0015)
WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAMIEG'S GETTING THE JOB SIR	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0016)
BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALDUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE THAPHIC SIGNALS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0017)
THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY WELL	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0018)
THEN IN THAT SECOND WE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0019)
THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT WHICH POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0020)
ACROSS THE WATER WHERE IS THE THREE WAY	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0021)
IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALL AND SMOKE STACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0022)
WHAT WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0023)
FLABBERGASTED AND DEATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0024)
NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPSLIT STREETS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0025)
WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOTS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0026)
THE COURTYARD WAS SPACELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0027)
THE COAST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0028)
A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE A FLANGED COURT YARD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0029)
THEY DROVE INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0030)
MY WINDOW HAS A PICTURE FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0031)
THE LEARNING OF MAGIC BY NO MEANS EASY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0000)
HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSTOR HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0001)
CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HERSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0002)
ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOW WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0003)
WHAT SHOULD ALLARD DO FIRST	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0004)
HOW YOU'VE IMPROVED MY BOY HE HAD EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0005)
SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGED BACK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0006)
MISTER WARER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0007)
THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER HIGGER SAID START AT ONCE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0008)
THE SENSATION SPREAD FAST AND FASTER	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0009)
HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK AND HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0010)
HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT ALWAYS BY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0011)
SEVENTY FOUR TWELVE ONE THE RETURN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0012)
THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE HAD CURVED WITH POINTING TOES	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0013)
BUT ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0014)
IF HE HAD TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0015)
HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE COVERED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0016)
BUT HOW DID YOU CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0017)
CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S STORE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0018)
HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY IT RESUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPEN THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0019)
THE AFTERNOON RAINY BEFORE INCREASE IN STORM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0020)
DUST CAME IN TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0021)
CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POUR'D AT THE PROPER TIME	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0022)
MISTER WORKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKER AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCION FUMED AND GLOWED	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0023)
WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO WOMAN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0024)
IT WAS AS IF MY STIFFNESS MELTED	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0025)
UNDER HIS EYES THE WAVEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0026)
THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED HE LET THE BOUQUET FALL	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0027)
THEY WENT ROUND TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0000)
GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DIDN'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0001)
NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED ON THE HELM BY ALBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0002)
IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL GET MY EYES OPEN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0003)
THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHUTI	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0004)
WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE DOWN THERE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0005)
CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE CAN DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0006)
CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING OH	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0007)
MISTER FINN WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0008)
HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO NOT DO AS IN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0009)
THE CAPTAIN STOOD FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0010)
HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY THAT I DO	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0011)
THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR A FAMILY	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0012)
HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN HIS REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0013)
WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0014)
THIS SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN MAY BE IN YOUR HANDS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0015)
YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY HERE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0016)
CHAPTER BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN ITS WINNING SMILE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0017)
HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH THE SURROUNDINGS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0018)
CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME IF UNDERSTOOD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0019)
WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS HOPED TO ASK	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0020)
I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND CREW KNOW	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0021)
I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CANNOT CARE FOR YOU	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0022)
NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WOODER HAD CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0023)
HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTION AND ACCOUNTED FOR	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0024)
THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN NO LITTLE WHILE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0025)
WHAT CHURCHYARDS YAN	(533-1066-533-1066-0000)
I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN AND PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD	(533-1066-533-1066-0001)
I'M SURE I KILLED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT	(533-1066-533-1066-0002)
FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR CALL IN THE LODGE	(533-1066-533-1066-0003)
OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOUNTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES	(533-1066-533-1066-0004)
MISS ININS HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TO NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0005)
I HAVE KNOWN I SAID HAPPILY	(533-1066-533-1066-0006)
I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNNATURAL	(533-1066-533-1066-0007)
THE MOST UNUSUAL THING THAT I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0008)
SOMETHING HAS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID	(533-1066-533-1066-0009)
PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME ODD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING	(533-1066-533-1066-0010)
LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST AND I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0011)
THEY WERE TALKING COFIERENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED	(533-1066-533-1066-0012)
THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR INTO THE NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0013)
I ASKED HIM NO QUESTIONS	(533-1066-533-1066-0014)
ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY TO DOCTOR STUART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE	(533-1066-533-1066-0015)
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I EXPECT IT	(533-1066-533-1066-0016)
THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMETHING WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT	(533-1066-533-1066-0017)
I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A DREADFUL SPOT	(533-1066-533-1066-0018)
IN SIGHT OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN SHARPLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0019)
IT WAS ALEX ARMORED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES	(533-1066-533-1066-0020)
THE OFFICER KEPT A KEEN LOOK OUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED	(533-1066-533-1066-0021)
THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF THE COMPLICITY	(533-1066-533-1066-0022)
A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT TIPPING THEM UP	(533-1066-533-1066-0023)
I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMETIMES I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN	(533-1066-533-1066-0024)
BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY ARRIVE	(533-131556-533-131556-0000)
FOR NONE SHOULD ENDURE ME AS HE HAS DONE OH	(533-131556-533-131556-0001)
THE WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A SILLY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM	(533-131556-533-131556-0002)
I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING THAT SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED	(533-131556-533-131556-0003)
I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD THEM SO MOMENTLY	(533-131556-533-131556-0004)
THEY HAD BETAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECIATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK	(533-131556-533-131556-0005)
I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I COULD NOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT	(533-131556-533-131556-0006)
UPON PERUSING THIS SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HIS LIP	(533-131556-533-131556-0007)
YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND IT'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT	(533-131556-533-131556-0008)
LL OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE	(533-131556-533-131556-0009)
AND YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS	(533-131556-533-131556-0010)
IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I COULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE	(533-131556-533-131556-0011)
I ENJOY A MOONLIGHT RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES ON HER AND THE THRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RESORTS	(533-131556-533-131556-0012)
SHE COLORED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER FACE AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE	(533-131556-533-131556-0013)
I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOORWAY I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY	(533-131556-533-131556-0014)
YES YESS	(533-131556-533-131556-0015)
SUPPOSE I DO YOU	(533-131556-533-131556-0016)
SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT TELL	(533-131556-533-131556-0017)
I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW TERRIFIED TONE	(533-131556-533-131556-0018)
IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL RATHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR ADEPT FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE	(533-131556-533-131556-0019)
YOU SHALL NOT TELL HIM	(533-131556-533-131556-0020)

THE ACTION SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0000)
HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH THE FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0001)
HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COURSE SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THAT SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0002)
SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR ATTO A BALLOT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0003)
WE SHED YOUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0004)

I EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0007)
LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOUT FLEROV SHOULD BE PUT TO A VOTE	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0008)
HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FREDOV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0009)
BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD NO RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0010)
TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THEIR REFRESHMENT BAR	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0011)
HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GREY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED A SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JURED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0012)

SERGEY IVANOVITCH CROWNED	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0014)
THAT IS A MATTER FOR ANOTHER MAN'S OWN DECISION HE SAID SEVERELY	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0015)
HAVING PUT IT DOWN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0016)

HE'S SUCH A BLACK GUARD	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0002)
I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK IT	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0003)
THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHENCE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0004)

AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH HERE'S ONE'S OWN INTERESTS	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0012)
THEY ARE PROPRIETORS OF A SOOT BUT WE ARE THE LANDOWNERS	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0013)
WHAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0014)
IF WE'RE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THAT VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0015)

TO MY THINKING I'D PUT DOWN THAT LIME TREE	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0022)
HERE YOU'VE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BARK	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0023)
YOU'RE MARRIED I GUESS SAID THE LANDOWNER	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0024)
YES IT'S RATHER THE STRANGE HE WENT ON	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0025)
THE LANDOWNER CHUCKLING UNDER HIS WHITE MUSTACHES	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0026)
WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR PACKS FOR TUMBLE	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0027)
SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO HER THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0028)
THERE'S THE CLASS INSTINCTS TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0029)

WITHOUT A RETURN TOO AT A SMALL LOSS	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0031)
WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM THEN	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0000)
BUT HERMANN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO A FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANER	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0001)
SHE WOULD APPEAR THEREFORE AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0002)
SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS AMBITION	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0003)
THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET THEY COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0004)
HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL FOR HER	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0005)
SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUED DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MIRTILLUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0006)
THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARISEING IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0007)
WHEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBORING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0008)
HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN AND THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0009)

IN THE ITALIAN POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0016)
THEY SAY THAT HE IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0017)
COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCION	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0018)
WITH YOUR TALENTS I WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0019)
THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM THE TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0000)
THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MEN	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0001)
SHE IS BEGINNING TO RISK THAT	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0002)
JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR CONTINUED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORKADAY ASPECT	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0003)
HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PENCIL CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0004)
IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH EYES	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0005)
THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS THE HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0006)
THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE THE GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0007)
AND YET THE READER WHO LACKS A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0008)
AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY THE SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0009)

HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LANNER WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0012)
SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THIS LATTER	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0013)
HAVE IT BEEN IN EUROPE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0014)
NO THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0015)
SHE HATES AND SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0016)

BESIDE OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BUSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0021)
THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY WANTS	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0022)
SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF THE FACE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0023)
HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNER'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0024)
HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CARLYLE'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0025)
I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE WERE GOING TO A THEATRE PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0026)
MISSUS LUNER'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANSLOW THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0027)
POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BIE OTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0000)
THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LANU'S SISTER	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0001)
RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT ENEMY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0002)
HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD LOVE HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0003)
SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0004)
HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME THEY HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0005)
THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THREE YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0006)
IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWER TO HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0007)
IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING MIGHT BE TAKEN	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0008)
OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT THE GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0009)
SHE HAD ERECTED IT WITH A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0010)
SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER SHE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0011)
I WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0012)
OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BAZER RANSOM DID NOT CARE TO CONTEND	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0013)

PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN TO SOME OTHERS	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0002)
IN HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0003)
OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE THAT TO LIVE THERE WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0004)
ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FAVENDER WHO LIVED AT RUXBY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0005)
SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINGERS SUPPOSED AND THEN THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0006)

RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A HEAVY FIFTY PROPOSITION	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0047)
AT FIRST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH THE SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0048)

NO ALIMONY REPLIED THE COLONEL PUZZLED YES JUST THEN	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0058)
AND IT'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0059)
CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILLFULLY TIED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0000)
AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0001)

WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0005)
IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LOVER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0006)
IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HIS HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0007)
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK OR THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0008)
THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEW NEWS TO HIM	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0009)
AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONDEMNED	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0010)
HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHERS	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0011)
SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE WHEN SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0012)
BECAUSE LARCH MAKE NO DEFENCE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0013)
LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM BUT DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0014)
SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO A COUNCIL FEE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0015)
NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT BUT HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0016)
AS IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0017)
STILL I'D LIKE TO KNOW	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0018)
THE MURDER OF MISTER DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELLER WAS TRIED	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0019)
IT HAD A DEEP REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0020)
GRAVE AND EVEN REVERENT THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALL ROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN HIS DINING ROOM OR CAFE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0021)
LARCHE HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0022)
IN A SMALLER CLASS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0023)
BUT IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RACHFORD HAD MARRIED	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0024)
TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER I WHISPERED MONEY	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0025)
AN IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0026)
SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME PROVISIONS	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0027)
AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LORCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0028)

BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE OLDER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0030)
IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT TO ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0031)

PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT AND ARCHIE WAS SILENT	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0006)
THEN AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARK DOORWAY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0007)
HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD REINSTROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0008)
BUT ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0009)
COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN IT	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0010)
I' WILL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0011)

TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR THEM HOW TO ESCAPE	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0015)
THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FILLED INTO THE STONE SILL	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0016)
NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEYS	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0017)
OH YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0018)

AN NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN TWO PLACES	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0021)
HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD COULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0022)
BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE FOR THE HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0023)

WHAT A QUEER JOURNEY HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0006)

AND WHY SHOULD ANDY CALL MISTER GURR FATHER	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0008)

ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAIN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARED NOT HUNT HIM DOWN	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0013)
OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONEWORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0014)

A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOUR AND VAIN	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0028)
HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS IF HE REALIZED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0029)
THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASSAILING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0030)
