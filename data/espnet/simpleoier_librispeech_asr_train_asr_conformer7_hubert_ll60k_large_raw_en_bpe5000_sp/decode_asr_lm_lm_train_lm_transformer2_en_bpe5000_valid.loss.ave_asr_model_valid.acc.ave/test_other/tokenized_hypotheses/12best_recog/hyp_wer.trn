BUT THEN RELIGION IS ATTACKED WHY	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0089)
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN BAD PRIESTS BECAUSE SAGATTARA BISHOP OF GAP WAS A BROTHER OF CEYLON BISHOP OF EMBRUM AND BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM FOLLOWED MAMAL	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0090)
AND THEY PERSECUTE THE SAINTS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0091)

I CAN MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0130)
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY PRICES AND DESSERT DISHES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0000)
THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITY THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0001)
FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVING	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0002)
BUT TO DISCOVER THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0003)
IF YOU DIP A FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0004)
LET IT BOIL OUT AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0005)
IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHENEVER TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0006)
BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0007)
FOURTEEN NINETY EIGHT	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0008)
BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH DAY AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0009)
THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID IN THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0010)
FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS OF SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0011)
THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURN EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0012)
IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE ABSORBED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0013)
MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTE ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY REQUEST	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0014)
MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0015)
THAT THEY MAY MAKE IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0016)
IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT UPON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0017)
CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN O NINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0018)
IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMALLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFERCET TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0019)
THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM A CONFECTIONER AND THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0020)
HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST JUDGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0021)
THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES IN STEMS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0022)
ISUS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0023)
AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES THE ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0024)
THE SPADDLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0025)
THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THEIR SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0026)
THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND HER DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0000)
FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO EASE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0001)
THEN HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0002)
KISS ME GIRL SAID THE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0003)
AND WHEN THE PRINCE ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0004)
THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THAT HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0005)
AT LAST I CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0006)
WELL IF MY DAUGHTER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0007)
WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAID ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0008)
ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT HERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0009)
SHE SPOKE VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0010)
OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHERS SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0011)
I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0012)
THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS DOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0013)
NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY WIFE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0014)
WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOS ASKED THE KING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0000)
THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FLOORS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0001)
WAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0002)
YES THAT I HAVE SAID A YOUTH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0003)
HE HAD GONE ABOUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0004)
THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD WHICH HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0005)
WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH THE DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0006)

ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0000)
THE OLD KING WENT ABOUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0001)
BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN BUT AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0002)
SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DID YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0003)
THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0004)
HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU COULD NOT FEAR HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0005)
AND THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0006)
ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE THIEF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0007)
SO REGAN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW OF A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0008)
THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS WIFE AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0009)
AND SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0010)
THEN WE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0011)
BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST A SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0012)
SIGURD SAID I SHOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0013)
BUT ALL MEN DIED AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0014)
DIE THOU FAFFNER AND THEN STAFNER DIED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0015)
THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FALFNER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0016)
SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNER ON A STEAK AND ROAST IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0017)
THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHILE HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0018)
THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRIGNHILD SLEEPS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0019)
THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING ARISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0020)

THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY THEN HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0022)
LYNN BRINHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0023)

THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOUR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BAD BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN	(367-130732-367-130732-0003)

ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY THE STATION BOX	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0025)

YOU'RE IN THE WAY BUT HOW	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0001)
WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A GIRL HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0002)
DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME TENDERLY	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0003)
MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWER YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0004)
YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING SO	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0005)
BECAUSE I AM WATCHED BUT THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0006)
IS THAT REAL THE ONLY REASON	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0007)
IF THEY WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0008)
HONESTLY WILL YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0009)
I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I WOULD GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0010)
WILL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0011)
I LISTENED THEN I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0012)
WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS AND SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0013)

NEITHER DO THEY GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0018)

THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAD THE POWER TO HELP THEE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0013)
HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS REVENGE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0014)
A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THAT KEYHOLE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0015)
THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF THE SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0016)
AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS INTO A CHEESE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0017)
IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE HORSE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0018)
WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THAT FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0019)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU CRIED THE POOR PEASANT	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0020)
MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0021)
THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECOME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0022)
TO HIM WHO SHOULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0023)
AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIDI'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0024)
BUT ETHELRIED HEEDS NOT THEIR TAUNTS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0025)
SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE NIOULT	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0026)
HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOYS OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0000)
IT HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0001)
HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NEVER DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0002)
TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAD NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0003)
MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED BUT HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0004)
THE HALF LIGHTS OF NIGHT PAINED HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0005)
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARK FURTHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0006)
HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESRANGE HIM FROM HIS FATHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0007)
HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH APPEARED TO HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0008)
IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS LINES OF EXISTENCE	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0009)
WE SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0010)
REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO GO AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0011)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRA	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0012)
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT SEE	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0013)
SILVER AND GOLD HERE IT IS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0014)
YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND THE COAT AND MY BOOTS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0015)
WHICH WILL BE ENOUGH	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0016)
NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER IT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0017)
AND YOU KNOW GERMAN NO	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0018)
IT IS BADLY MADE WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0019)
THE CLOUDS DEALER WAS SENT FOR	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0020)
HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS HE WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0021)
IT BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0022)
HULLO I'VE FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0023)
THE LANDLORD PRESENTED THE BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0024)
I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT FOR MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0025)
AND WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0026)
ONE MORNING UPON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0027)
MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH HIS RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0028)
AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0029)
HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE YOUNG MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0000)
BEFORE HER HE WANTED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0001)
THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST JESUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0002)
WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCES TELL ME EVERYTHING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0003)
IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE DID NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0004)
AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT BACK WITH A SIGH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0005)
THAT FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0006)
AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MILUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0007)
THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROFESSION WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0008)
YES THAT'S AN UNUSUAL THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0009)
BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKI BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0010)
HE ASKED AH IT	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0011)
OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT FOR TWENTY MINUTES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0012)
AND HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABOVE ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0013)
WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH AND LOWERING IT	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0014)
THE COMPANY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0015)
BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITION CALLING UP REMINISCENCES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0016)
AND THEN YOUR MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0017)
AH BUT IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0018)
BUT TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0019)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED THIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0020)
OH OH ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0021)
AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO A DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0022)
WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND THE EYES FILLED WITH TEARS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0023)
SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FIERCE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0024)
EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT OF THIS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0025)
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'D ASKED ME THE SAME THING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0026)
A CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENSE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0027)
NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM PERHAPS I HAD FINISHED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0028)
AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH ARE CERTAINLY HARMLESS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0029)
AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GET ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0030)
FINALLY HIS POSITION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0031)
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS BEFORE THE DOCTOR HAD GONE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0032)
THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND PETER PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARFUL	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0033)
EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE HIGHER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0000)
THIS IS EASILY INCORRECT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0001)
IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTEREST TO THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0002)
THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRIED TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0003)
THAT MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0004)
THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY AS BODILY VIOLENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0005)
THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS PROVED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0006)
THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE BODY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0007)
THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF HONOR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0008)
POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN OF POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0009)
INDEED IT COULD NOT OTHERWISE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0010)
ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SPECIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0011)
BUT SINCE THAT IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0012)
EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THEIR GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0013)
BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMED STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMED EVEN MORE SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0014)
IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND UPON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0015)
AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONVENTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0016)
BUT THAT JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0017)
INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREES OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0018)
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND LARGER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0019)
AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE OF THE GOLDEN EGGS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0020)
THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT DAYS SUBDUED BY CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0021)
SO IT HAS ALREADY BEEN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0022)
FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THE POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0023)
THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ENEMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0024)
THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKE THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0025)
THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BEAR UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0026)
AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS RETAINED BY THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0027)
BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNORS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0028)
AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FOR ITS NEIGHBOUR BRIGANDS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0029)
THIS IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0030)
EVERY INCREASE OF THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBOURING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0031)
THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF AN ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0032)
THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0033)
AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL THE CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0034)
THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL LITERARY SERVICE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0035)
IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF SOCIAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0036)
AND WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0037)
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES TO STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0038)
THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATEST PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOUR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0039)
THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF A LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0040)
BUT THE VITAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS A MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0041)
GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES WERE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0042)
THEY ARE CONNECTED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0043)
AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I TAKING THEM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0044)
I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN EASE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0045)
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACK OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0046)
WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND INFLUENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0047)
SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0048)
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE A RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0049)
WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING EVERYTHING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0050)
BUT THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0051)
THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0052)
WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR LABORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0053)
THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY WAS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0054)
AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THIS PURPOSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0055)
THE POWER OF THAT STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBOURS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0056)
EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVICE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0057)
TO REST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0058)
SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE HEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSOR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0059)
FOR A MAN OF THE OLD WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0060)
SAY YOU KNOW SOMEBODY	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0000)
CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR JACKS AND SPARK PLUG	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0001)
NO WHO NEEDS THE JOB MAN THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0002)
O K SHE SAID	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0003)
ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME YOURSELF	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0004)
MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC HAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN EM STREET	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0005)
WELL HE MUTTERED I DID	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0006)
CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED FROM HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0007)
THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PROCEEDED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0008)
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUST EDGED IN THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0009)
MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE INTO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0010)
BITCHER AREN'T GOIN AFTER ALL JUST TURNED TO HIM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0011)
MIKE WAS STANDING ON A QUARTER	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0012)
I SHUCKS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0013)
CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED UPON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0014)
AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING WHICH SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0015)
THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK AT A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0016)
A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GREY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOUT	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0017)
THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL WHEN CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THE JOB	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0018)
ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED HIMSELF	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0019)
AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSES	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0020)
THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALMOST CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0021)
ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTRE THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GRAY GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0022)
BUT THE NAMES STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES ON THE MIRABELLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0023)
HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP WHEN HE THOUGHT OF IT	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0024)
HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHY DID HE EVER SELL	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0025)
A SUDDEN CARHORN WOKE FROM HIS DREAM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0026)
OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE IN MISTER WICKER'S SHOP	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0000)
SO NOW ALONE TILL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY ROUND HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0001)
WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW IN THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0002)
HEAVY HAND HEMMED BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0003)
MISTER WICKER'S BACK WAS TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0004)
THE DOUBLE PANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0005)
LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAT BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0006)
CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKING AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0007)
SMITH SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0008)
YES SIR HE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0009)
I SEE YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0010)
HE HAS A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0011)
JAKIE HARRIS'S NAME IS IF HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0012)
I I JUST WONDERED IF THE VICE WAS STILL OPEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0013)
WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY IN GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0014)
I GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0015)
WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE'S GETTING THE JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0016)
BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALNUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE THAPHIC SIGNALS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0017)
THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0018)
NOW IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0019)
THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE THEM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0020)
ACROSS THE WATER WHERE IS A FREE WAY	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0021)
I WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKE STACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0022)
THE WAREHOUSES WAS STILL THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0023)
FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW INTO EVERY DIRECTION	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0024)
NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMP LIGHTED STREETS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0025)
WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY A INN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0026)
THE COURTYARD WAS SPARSELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0027)
THE POST IS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0028)
A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAKED COURTYARD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0029)
THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED UP TO THE STABLE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0030)
MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FOR THE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0031)
THE LEARNING OF MUSIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0000)
HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0001)
CHRIS THEREFORE THROW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0002)
ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOX WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0003)
WHAT SHOULD ALLEY DO FIRST	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0004)
HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0005)
SUPPOSE YOU CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0006)
MISTER MARKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0007)
THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER NIGGER SAID START AT ONCE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0008)
THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER FASTER	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0009)
HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH A FINAL WORDS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0010)
HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT ALMOST BY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0011)
SEVENTY FOUR BOAT ONE THE RETURN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0012)
THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE IT CURVED UP POINTING TOES	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0013)
THEN ALL AT ONCE THIS IDEA CAME TO CHRIS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0014)
IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS GIRL COME TO LIFE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0015)
HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINING THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0016)
BUT HOW DID ONE A CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0017)
CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER VICKER'S DOOR	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0018)
HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIR CASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY IT RESUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0019)
THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE INCREASED INTO STORM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0020)
DUST CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARL IN THE SKY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0021)
CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURING AT THE PROPER TIME	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0022)
MISTER WORKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UP STAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKE AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCION FUMED AND GLOWED	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0023)
WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0024)
IT WAS AS IF THE THICKNESS MELTED	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0025)
UNDER HIS EYES THE WIDEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND ON THE FACE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0026)
THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED BUT LET THE BOUQUET FALL	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0027)
THEY WENT DOWN TO OUR QUARTERS FIRST	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0000)
GUESS MISTER KINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0001)
NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ALBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DECK	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0002)
IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0003)
THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHITTI	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0004)
WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON THEN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0005)
CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS LONG AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0006)
CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY COLD AND PENETRATING	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0007)
MISTER FINNE WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD HERE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0008)
HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS BUT THIS MIGHT DO NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0009)
THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0010)
AND HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY THAT I DO	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0011)
THIS SHE IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0012)
HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT GRACE STANDING BEFORE HIM	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0013)
WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU ARE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0014)
THE SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MAN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0015)
YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY YES SIR	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0016)
CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN THE WINNING SMILE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0017)
HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE FISH WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0018)
CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN NOR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTOOD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0019)
WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS WANTED TO ASK	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0020)
I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND CREW KNEW IT	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0021)
I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN YOUR OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0022)
NOT SINCE HE LEFT MISTER WALKER AND CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0023)
HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCES FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTIONILY ACCOUNTED FOR	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0024)
THAT CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0025)
AND CHURCHYARDS YAN	(533-1066-533-1066-0000)
I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED TO THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD	(533-1066-533-1066-0001)
I'M SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISSUS JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT	(533-1066-533-1066-0002)
FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL IN A LODGE	(533-1066-533-1066-0003)
OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEN CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES	(533-1066-533-1066-0004)
MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM DOWNSTAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TO NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0005)
I HAVE NONE I SAID QUIETLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0006)
I MEAN HE PERSISTED DID YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL	(533-1066-533-1066-0007)
THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE THAT PEACEFUL NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0008)
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID	(533-1066-533-1066-0009)
PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MINDS NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING	(533-1066-533-1066-0010)
LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF A JUST WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0011)
THEY WERE TALKING COLIENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED	(533-1066-533-1066-0012)
THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE CONSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0013)
I ANSWERED NO QUESTIONS	(533-1066-533-1066-0014)
ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STUWART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE	(533-1066-533-1066-0015)
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I HAD EXPECTED	(533-1066-533-1066-0016)
THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFED SOMEWHAT WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT	(533-1066-533-1066-0017)
I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED THE CHEERFUL SPOT	(533-1066-533-1066-0018)
IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH UP SHARPLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0019)
THAT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES	(533-1066-533-1066-0020)
THE DOCTOR KEPT A KEEN LOOK ABOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED	(533-1066-533-1066-0021)
THERE'S ONE THING SURE HE'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY	(533-1066-533-1066-0022)
A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING THEM OUT	(533-1066-533-1066-0023)
I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND DOWN	(533-1066-533-1066-0024)
BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY KNOW	(533-131556-533-131556-0000)
FOR NONE COULD ENDURE ME AS HE HAS DONE SO	(533-131556-533-131556-0001)
THE ROAD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM	(533-131556-533-131556-0002)
I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO EXPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED	(533-131556-533-131556-0003)
I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD THEM MORE MINUTELY	(533-131556-533-131556-0004)
THEY HAD DETAINED THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK	(533-131556-533-131556-0005)
I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF THAT	(533-131556-533-131556-0006)
UPON PERUSING THIS SHE TURNED SLIGHTLY AND BIT HER LIP	(533-131556-533-131556-0007)
YOU MAY GO MILICENT AN SHE'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT	(533-131556-533-131556-0008)
I'LL OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE	(533-131556-533-131556-0009)
YOU YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS	(533-131556-533-131556-0010)
IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I SHALL HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE	(533-131556-533-131556-0011)
I ENJOY A MOONLAND RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THE SHRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESORTS	(533-131556-533-131556-0012)
SHE COLORED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGERS AGAINST HER CHEEKS AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE	(533-131556-533-131556-0013)
I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION AND MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY	(533-131556-533-131556-0014)
YES YES SIR	(533-131556-533-131556-0015)
SUPPOSE WE DO	(533-131556-533-131556-0016)
SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERATION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW	(533-131556-533-131556-0017)
I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE ADDED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE	(533-131556-533-131556-0018)
IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL RATHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR ADICTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE	(533-131556-533-131556-0019)
I SHALL NOT SEE HIM	(533-131556-533-131556-0020)

HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COARSE SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THIS SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0002)

HE FORGOT AS SERGEYA IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHALS WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0009)

WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0000)
BUT HERMANN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRATENER	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0001)
SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN IN AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0002)
SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH THIS OPPOSITION	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0003)
THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET WE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0004)

SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTLE HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0006)
HIS APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0007)
THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBORING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY BUT IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0008)
HITHERTO A MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0009)
WHEN HERMANN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATIUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS ALREADY ASSEMBLED	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0010)
