AND THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN MY DIRECTION THIS EVENING	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0028)
I WAS MOTHER CRUCIFIXION	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0029)

THESE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0031)
A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEAD DOOR MORE OFTEN	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0032)

FATHER THUVIN THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0043)

THERE WAS SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT FAITH	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0047)
FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORISONS WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0048)
AND FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE SHE WENT ON	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0049)

BUT WE ARE IGNORANT AND IMPIOUS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0088)
AND THEN RELIGION IS ATTACKED UPON	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0089)
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN BAD PRIESTS BECAUSE SAGATTARA BISHOP OF GAPP WAS THE BROTHER OF CEYLONE BISHOP OF EMBRUM AND BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM FOLLOWED MAMUL	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0090)
THEY COMMUNICATE THE SAINTS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0091)
THEY SHUT THEIR EYES TO THE TRUTH DARKNESS IS THE LAW	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0092)

OF THE EMPTY COFFIN REMAINS THIS PRODUCED A PAUSE	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0123)
WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH THAT COFFIN FATHER SAVEN	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0124)
IT WILL BE GIVEN TO THE EARTH TO EMPTY	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0125)
OH ALIDA EXCLAIMED FAUCHELEVENT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0126)
THE VEAL STUCK FAST AT HIS THROAT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0127)
HE MADE HASTE TO IMPROVISE AN EXPEDIENT TO MAKE HER FORGET THE EVIL	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0128)
I WILL PUT EARTH IN THE COFFIN REVERED MOTHER THAT WILL PRODUCE THE EFFECT OF A CORPSE	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0129)
I'LL MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0130)
TO GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0000)
THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THOSE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0001)
FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BECOME OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0002)
BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERED EXPERIENCE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0003)
IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFECT A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0004)
LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF OR REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0005)
IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WITH SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0006)
BEFORE SUGAR IS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0007)
FOURTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0008)
BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMINGS EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0009)
THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT WAS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0010)
FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING ROOTS BY SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0011)
THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OIL ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0012)
IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHEPS ARE PRESERVED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0013)
MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PIES ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0014)
MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THERE ARE PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RIND WITH SUGAR	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0015)
THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN OF THREE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0016)
IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON A FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0017)
CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN OH EIGHT	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0018)
IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMALLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICEE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0019)
THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER AND THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE IN HOME	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0020)
HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGE'S FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0021)
THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT FIRST BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0022)
ISIS I	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0023)
AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SLIGHTLY TO BE DISPENSED WITH	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0024)
THE SPATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF PEPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0025)
THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST AND SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0026)
THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HER FIRST WIFE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0000)
FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRIED TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0001)
OF HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0002)
KISS ME GIRL SAID THE HAIR	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0003)
AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SOUGHT IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0004)
THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH THROUGH THE KING'S PALACE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0005)
AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THAT LAND	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0006)
WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HIS CASKET INTO THE SEA	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0007)
WHAT IS OUR BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0008)
ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THAT KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0009)
SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR THEN THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0010)
OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE IN SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0011)
I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAY SHE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0012)
THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NOT AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0013)
NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY HEAD AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0014)
WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOLLS ASKED THE KING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0000)
THE YOUTH THOUGHT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOWLS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0001)
HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE ON THE EVENING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0002)
YES THAT I BE SAID THE YOUTH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0003)
HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAYS BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0004)
THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAS PROMISED HIS BROTHER	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0005)
WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE STOPPED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTIFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0006)

SINDERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0018)

THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND THE MEN FLED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0001)

SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING FOR THE MORNING AND SHE SAID	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0003)
THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0004)
HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAYS THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0005)
THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND FOUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0006)
ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DUKE WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0007)
SO REGAN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURDY TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0008)
AND SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0009)
SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD YOU	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0010)
THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE CAME TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0011)
BUT SIGURD WAITING TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0012)
SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY MOVING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0013)
BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO WISE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0014)
DIE THOU FAFFNER AND THEN SAFNER DIED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0015)
THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFFER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0016)
SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNER ON THIS STEAK AND ROASTED IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0017)
THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LOVE ALL WISDOM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0018)
THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINGFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINKHILD SLEEPS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0019)
THEN MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0020)
THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL THING	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0021)
THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND SHE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0022)
LINBRANHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0023)

WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A COURTE	(3764-168670-3764-168670-0044)

THIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE THE HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0001)
A MORNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND THE CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0002)
BEHIND IT CAME THE OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABORER WHO LIMPED ALONG	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0003)
THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING OF SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0004)

TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHET IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNISED AS ELEGANT	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0008)
THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN INTO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MARY CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENCE IN OUR SIGHT	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0009)
IT IS ONE OF THE FACTS WHICH RESEMBLE A DUTY	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0010)
THE NUNS HAD KISSED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0011)
IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THEIR GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0012)
MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE ME BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0013)
A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PUBLIC	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0014)
THEN FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0015)
JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE HORRIBLE TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0016)
WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHINGNESS	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0017)

HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN WHIM	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0019)
THE PERMISSION FOR INTERMENT WILL BE EXHIBITED	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0020)
HE WAS THE SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0021)
THE MAN REPLIED THE GRAVE DIGGING	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0022)
THE GRAVE DIGGER NOW	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0023)

FATHER PESTIENNE IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0025)
FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING FOR THIS BUT A GRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0026)

THE GRAVE DIGGER ROLLED ON IN FRONT OF HIM	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0035)
FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED CREVIER ONCE MORE IN VIEW	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0036)

FAUCHELEVENTIN THOUGHT I AM LOST	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0043)
THERE WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF A WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUNS CORNER	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0044)
AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SUPERIOR MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0045)
FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET FROM THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0046)
MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE PRETNIUM TOWN HALL	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0047)

FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY IT	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0052)
THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH HIS SUPERIOR SMILE	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0053)
ONE MUST TREAT	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0054)
THE DUCK COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0000)

THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR THAT	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0003)
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I KNEW	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0004)
NOW SEE I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0005)
IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING THING BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0006)
EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST CONSOLATION OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0007)
THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIFLE THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0008)
THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VALLEY	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0009)
WITH ME THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0010)
THEY SAID BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0011)
WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NOT FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0012)

THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN AND WHEN THEY LOVE SERIOUSLY	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0015)
BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE WAS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0016)
BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LAISSONS	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0017)
WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MUCH GAYETY	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0018)
THE GIRL BECOMES THE MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0019)
WELL WHY	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0020)
MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORIES OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0021)
HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT TO THE VAUDEVILLE	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0022)

THE BOXES FILLED UP ONE AFTER ANOTHER	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0024)
THE ONLY ONE REMAINS EMPTY THE STAGE BOX	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0025)
AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0026)
DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I MUST BE	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0027)
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND RUNNING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0028)

AND YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0031)
BECAUSE HE DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0032)
NONE THE LESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THIS EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0033)
THAT I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0000)
WE'RE IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0001)
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0002)
DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME ANXIOUSLY	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0003)
MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ASKED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0004)
YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME OR SAYING NO	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0005)
BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATER HARM	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0006)
IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY ANSWER	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0007)
IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER YET	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0008)
HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL OH	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0009)
I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0010)
WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS IT	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0011)
I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MAGGIE WITH ADMIRATION	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0012)
WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART OF HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0013)
TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRE AND INCONCEIVABLE HOPES	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0014)
WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED OUT AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0015)
WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OTHERS	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0016)
WE STAND FIRST ON THEIR SELF ESTEEM LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0017)
NEVER DO THEY GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT A LUCRATIVE	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0018)
IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN A CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0019)
SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER AFFECTS NOR CONSOLES	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0020)

WHAT I LOVED AND BELIEVED WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0022)
MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH HER LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0023)
MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW THAT WOULD KILL ME	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0024)
MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SPOKE	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0025)
HERE HE IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0026)

ONE HAS TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT AND	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0030)

HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS DEEP AS A MILLSTONE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0011)
THE SIGHT WERE SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0012)
THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT THOUGH I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0013)
HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND AT ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS FREEDOM	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0014)
A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT AT THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYHOLE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0015)
THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT IN TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0016)
AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHIMNEY	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0017)
IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCES HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0018)
WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM AND FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0019)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR COUSIN	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0020)
MY GRAIN MUST FALL AN ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0021)
THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER AND HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0022)
TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME LORDS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0023)
AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRID'S BROTHER THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0024)
BUT ETHELRIB HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0025)
SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE ISOLT	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0026)
HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT HE FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0000)
HE HAVE BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0001)
HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DIE AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0002)
TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASANT ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0003)
MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE WORE THE TRUE LIGHT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0004)
THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINT HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0005)
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH BETTER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0006)
HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THAT POWER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0007)
HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THIS REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0008)
IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF RESISTANCE	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0009)
THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY AND	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0010)
REQUEST THE COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0011)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEFYRAC	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0012)
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW NOW	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0013)
SILVER GOLD OR HERE IT IS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0014)
YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COACH AND MY BOOTS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0015)
THAT WILL BE ANOTHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0016)
NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL HE DO AFTER THAT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0017)
DO YOU KNOW GERMAN I KNOW	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0018)
THAT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0019)
THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT ON	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0020)
SHE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0021)
WHO BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0022)
HELLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARCUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0023)
THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PLAYED ON THE SPOT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0024)
I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT TO MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0025)
THAT CAN BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0026)
ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALING BOX	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0027)
MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTIVE LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0028)
AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE COMPANIONS LEFT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0029)
HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALK TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0000)
BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER ITS PEARLS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0001)
THE PRINCESS WAS DISTURBED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0002)
WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE ASKED THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0003)
IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED BUT SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0004)
AS YOU PRAY THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0005)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY SEATED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0006)
AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALUTRITION AND NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0007)
THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT WAS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0008)
YET THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0009)
BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKI BRIDGE DONE YET OR WILL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0010)
HE ASKED AH IT'S	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0011)
OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT WITH TWENTY MINUTES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0012)
AND HOW ABOUT A TOUR BROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0013)
WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRATION ENOUGH FOR LOWERING IT	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0014)
THE THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0015)
BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING ON REMINISCENCES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0016)
AND THEN THE MASTER WISHES IT HE ADDED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0017)
AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUSS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0018)
ONLY TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0019)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS HER FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0020)
OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS MISTER COME THIS WAY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0021)
AS THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0022)
AS THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0023)
BUT SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0024)
EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECTS IN THIS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0025)
THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0026)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT GIVE OFFENCE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0027)
NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD VENTURED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0028)
AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE POSITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0029)
WITH THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0030)
FINALLY HIS DESIGN WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0031)
THAT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0032)
THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KATY PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARSFUL	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0033)
EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE AND THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0000)
THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY INCORRECT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0001)
IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTEREST OF THE GROUP	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0002)
THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL IMPULSE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0003)
THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY HIS MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0004)
THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS WHOLLY VIOLENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0005)
THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY THE ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0006)
THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THIS ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0007)
THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS FOR POWER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0008)
POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWERS FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0009)
INDEED THAT IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0010)
ONLY UNDER THIS CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0011)
BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSIONS OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0012)
EVEN IF THERE WERE ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0013)
BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMED STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THAT STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0014)
IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE OF CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0015)
AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATED CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0016)
THEN THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0017)
INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF SUPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0018)
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCES ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0019)
AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH THEY CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0020)
THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF AN ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0021)
HOW IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0022)
FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE HIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0023)
THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEAR THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0024)
THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POLES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TODAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0025)
THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE ABLE TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0026)
AND THIS ABNORMAL STATE OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0027)
BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVING SUBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0028)
AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT HIS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0029)
THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0030)
EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST HIS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0031)
THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF THAT GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0032)
THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THE MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0033)
AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECAME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0034)
THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0035)
IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL PERCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0036)
BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY FOUND TO AVOID	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0037)
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0038)
THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO FEED	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0039)
THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE'D SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0040)
BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AND THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0041)
GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT IS NOT TRUE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0042)
THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0043)
AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING ME	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0044)
I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0045)
YET FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0046)
WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS OR PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0047)
SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE BUSINESS ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0048)
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE COULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0049)
WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING BUSINESS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0050)
THIS ARGUMENT WHICH WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0051)
THE GRAND EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0052)
WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NATIVES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0053)
THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MUST ENSLAVE US	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0054)
AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEAN ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0055)
THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBOURS EXPOSES US UPON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0056)
EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATED DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0057)
TO INSIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0058)
SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AN ATTRACTOR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0059)
FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THEIR ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0060)
SAY YOU KNOW SOME	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0000)

MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN EMB STREET	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0005)
WELL HE ADMITTED I SHOULD	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0006)
CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRY WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0007)
THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE SAID	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0008)
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED TO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0009)
MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO THE ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0010)
BITCH AND AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED TO HIM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0011)
MIKE WAS STANDING ON A CORNER	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0012)
ALTHOUGH SHUCKS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0013)
CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0014)
AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO A CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0015)
THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK ON A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0016)
A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES IN GRAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0017)
THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS PROCEEDED TO FINISH THE JOB	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0018)
ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED UP	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0019)
AT THE FOOT OF THE HILLS HE REACHED THE HOUSE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0020)
THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY HILLS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0021)
ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GRAND GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0022)
BUT THE NAMES STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES OF THE MIRABELLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0023)
HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW THAT HE THOUGHT OF IT	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0024)
HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL IT	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0025)
A SUDDEN CARRORN WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0026)
OF OTHER MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0000)
SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOME ONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY AS UNEASILY AROUND HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0001)
WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW IN THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE A LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0002)
HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHERS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0003)
MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARDS THE SOURCE OF LIGHTS CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0004)
THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNERED TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0005)
LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE OR THE OLD MAN'S EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0006)
CROSS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0007)
CHRIS SWALLOWED AND THIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0008)
AH SIR HE SAID	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0009)

I I JUST WONDERED IF THE BRACE WAS STILL OPEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0013)
WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOUR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETIMES SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0014)
HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN A ROOM BEYOND	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0015)
WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE THAT'S GETTING THE JOB SIR	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0016)
BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALTUNDER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE THAPHIC SIGNALS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0017)
THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY DIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0018)
THEN IN THAT SECOND I TURNED AND FACED ABOUT	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0019)
THE WIDE LOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0020)
ACROSS THE WATER WHERE IS THE FREE WAVE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0021)
IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKE STACKS IN FACTORIES TO BE SEEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0022)
MY WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0023)
FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS HARRY WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0024)
NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLIT STREETSS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0025)
WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD NOT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0026)
THE COURTYARD WAS BRIGHTLY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0027)
THE HORSE WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0028)
THE COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLANGING COURTYARD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0029)
THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED BACK TO THE STABLE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0030)
MY WINDOW HAS SOME POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0031)
THE LEARNING OF THE MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0000)
HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSTAR HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0001)
PRINCE THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0002)
ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BILL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0003)
WHAT SHOULD ALL THIS DO FIRST	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0004)
HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY BUT THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0005)
PERHAPS I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0006)
MISTER WORKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO KEEP UP HIS COURAGE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0007)
THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER FRIGGER SAID START AT ONCE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0008)
THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER AND	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0009)
HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED FROM THE FINAL WORDS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0010)
HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED AND LESS BY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0011)

THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO JACK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0014)
IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BIRD COME TO LIFE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0015)
HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0016)
BUT HOW DID ONE ATTAIN INANIMATE TO ANIMATE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0017)
CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKE'S DOOR	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0018)
HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY WE RESUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0019)

WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD CROSSED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0024)
THAT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0025)
UNDER HIS EYES THE WIDE AND FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0026)
THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED NOT LET THE BOUQUET FALL	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0027)
THEY WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0000)

CHRIS LOST NO TIME SO SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0006)
CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES AN ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0007)
MISTER FINNEAR WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0008)
HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS WOULD DO NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0009)
THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT AND CONSIDERING	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0010)
THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY YOU DO	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0011)

HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE CITY WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0018)
CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME BUT UNDERSTOOD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0019)

FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL ON THE LODGE	(533-1066-533-1066-0003)
OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SPECIAL ABILITIES	(533-1066-533-1066-0004)

THE DOCTOR HELD A KEEN LOOKOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED	(533-1066-533-1066-0021)
AND THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY	(533-1066-533-1066-0022)
A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING THEM	(533-1066-533-1066-0023)
I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED BACK	(533-1066-533-1066-0024)

I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION WHEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY	(533-131556-533-131556-0014)
YES YES YOU	(533-131556-533-131556-0015)
YOU SUPPOSE I DO	(533-131556-533-131556-0016)
SHE PAUSED WITH EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW	(533-131556-533-131556-0017)

HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COURSE SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THE FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0002)

WHEN WE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0000)
BUT HERMIONN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANER	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0001)

SO THIS ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITION	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0003)
THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE WOULD NOT LET THAT DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0004)

THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT COULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0008)

SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND COURT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS THROUGH WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0001)

ABOUT WHAT ABOUT MY PAPERS	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0015)
IN THE ENTIRE PRACTICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0016)
THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIRY AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0017)
COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUC	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0018)
WITH YOUR TALENTS YOU WOULD MAKE A FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0019)
THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME ON THE TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0000)

IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION A YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0005)
THESE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0006)
THESE THINGS TO THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0007)
AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONES SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0008)

NO I HAVE N'T BEEN ANYWHERE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0015)
SHE HATES US SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0016)

BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER ON BUSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0021)
THAT WAS ONE COMFORT SAID OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0022)
SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS HE WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0023)
HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISTER LUNEY'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0024)

POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BA OE OTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0000)
THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNKE'S SISTER	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0001)
RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE POSSESSION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0002)
HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT SHE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0003)
SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST THE RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS THE ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0004)

IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND THESE RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0008)
OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF LEAVING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0009)
SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISKS SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0010)
SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET UP A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0011)

WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE DISTANT	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0003)
OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE IN A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0004)

IT ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THAT STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0009)
COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0010)
I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYING WITH	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0011)

SO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0013)
THE KILL HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0014)

NO THAT WAS TOO BAD SHE COULD NOT DO THAT	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0019)
SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR NOT THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0020)
A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN ALL PLACES	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0021)
HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH ROLLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0022)
BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE AND THAT HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0023)

OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOWS A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0014)
