BUT I WILL MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0130)
A GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0000)
THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT WITH SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0001)
FRUIT COVERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0002)
BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY IT REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0003)
IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB OF A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0004)
LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE SHARPLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0005)
IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP AND A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0006)
AFTER SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0007)
FOURTEEN NINETY NINE I	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0008)
BOIL THEM IN THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0009)
THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH A PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0010)
FROM THIS INSTANCE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0011)
THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE RETURNED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0012)
IN THIS WAY IT IS ALMOST THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0013)
MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTE ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND IS NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0014)
MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES A PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0015)
THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN TO THREE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0016)
IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKE WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0017)
A CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN O EIGHT	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0018)
IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICES TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUIZINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0019)
THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER AND THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT ONCE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0020)
IT HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0021)
THE SHAPES OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0022)
FOR ISIS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0023)
AT DESSERT'S OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0024)
THEIR SPATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0025)
THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOUR AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0026)
THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD AN SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0000)
FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THIS NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0001)
BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED LESS AND WORSE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0002)
KISS ME GIRL SAID A HEAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0003)
AND WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT OR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0004)
THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM A KING'S PALACE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0005)
AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THEIR LAND	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0006)
WELL IF MY BOY SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0007)
OH WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0008)
ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BLUSH	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0009)
SHE LOOKED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0010)
OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MADE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0011)
I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SHE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0012)
THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN THE DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0013)
NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND TO GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0014)
WILT THOU SERVICE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS ASKED THE KING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0000)
THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE WOUNDS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0001)
HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL A WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0002)
YET THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0003)
HE HAD BEEN OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0004)
THAN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0005)
WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING IN A DISTIFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0006)
COME HERE COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0007)

SINDER AD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0018)

I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDERLAT	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0024)
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS ILL	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0000)
THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST THIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0001)
BUT ON THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0002)
SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORROW AND SHE SAID	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0003)
THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWEEPS ACROSS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0004)
HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRIGHT AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0005)
THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND SHOT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0006)
ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HER	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0007)
SO RIGAN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0008)
THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO HEGAN	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0009)
SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD MIGHT DO	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0010)
THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THIS TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0011)
BUT SIGURD WALKED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0012)
SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF THIS IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0013)
BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0014)
DIE THOU FAFFENER AND THEN STAFFNER DIED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0015)
THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAUFFNER'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0016)
SO SIGURD PUT THE HAND OF FAFNER ON A STEAK AND ROASTED IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0017)
THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE COULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0018)
THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINUFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINHILD SLEEPS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0019)
THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE SHALL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0020)
THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF OF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0021)
THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE PALACE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0022)
LYN BRUNHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNER THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNER SET HIS HORSE AT A FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0023)
FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUNDRAN WERE BATHING BRUNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUNDRA'S SUPERIOR	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0024)
OF HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0025)

I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARQUIS WITH ADMIRATION	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0012)
WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF THE MAN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0013)

THE SIGHT WAS SO NATURAL THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0012)
THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS SOLEMN SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0013)

A FAINT GLITTER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEY HOLE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0015)
THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSES TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0016)
AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS HIS SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0017)
IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PLACE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0018)
WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLIGHT SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0019)
WHAT HAS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0020)
MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THAN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0021)
THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGHBORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0022)
TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT WITH THE OGRE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0023)
AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHEL RIED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0024)
BUT ETHELRYED HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0025)
SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE SIOULT	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0026)
HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY TO ARRIVE LATER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0000)
HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAME MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0001)
HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0002)
TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND FROM ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BATLIKE SOULS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0003)
MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE NIGHT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0004)
THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBTED HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0005)
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO WRITE FURTHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0006)
HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESRANGE HIM FROM THIS FATHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0007)
HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0008)
IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES IN EXISTENCE	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0009)
THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0010)
WE REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0011)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0012)
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW IT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0013)
SILVER THE GOLD HERE IT IS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0014)
YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT BUT MY BOOTS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0015)
THAT WILL BE KNOWN	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0016)
NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT CAN YOU DO AFTER THAT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0017)
DO YOU KNOW GERMAN OR NO	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0018)
IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE MAY LIVE BY IT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0019)
THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT OFF	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0020)
YOU PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0021)
HE BOUGHT THE WATCH WITH FORTY FIVE FRANCS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0022)
HULLOA I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0023)
THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID IN THE SPOT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0024)
I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT IN MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0025)
WHAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0026)
ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY TWO HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0027)
MARIUS SENT BACK THE FIFTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0028)
AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE CHEEKS LEFT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0029)
HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE SON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0000)
BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARL	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0001)
THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KIT	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0002)
WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FIGHT SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0003)
IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WILL DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0004)
AS YOU PLEASE MY PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0005)
THE COMPANY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0006)
AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALICUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0007)
THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN CONSEQUENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0008)
YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED CHRISTIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0009)
BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKI BRIDGE DEAD YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0010)
HE ASKED NOW IT IS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0011)
OH WELL NOW I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0012)
AND HOW IN A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0013)
WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH BUT LOWERING IT	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0014)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY AND	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0015)
BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS A REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0016)
AND THEN THE OTHERS WISHES IT HE ADDED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0017)
AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE BUT LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0018)
OH TIME'S UP ALREADY AND SHE WENT TO THE DOOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0019)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM THAT DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0020)
OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESSES COME THIS WAY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0021)
AND THE MOTHERS ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0022)
WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED A CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0023)
SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP HURRIED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0024)
EXCUSE ME MAJOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0025)
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ANSWERED ME THE SAME THING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0026)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DO NOT TAKE OFFENSE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0027)
NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FANCIED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0028)
AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITIONS OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARMLESS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0029)
AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY LOOK ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0030)
FINALLY HIS DISCIPLINE WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0031)
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNES HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0032)
THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL AS SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KATY PRETENDED TO BE MORE TEARFUL	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0033)
EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY FOR TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0000)
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0001)
IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WOULD VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTEREST FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0002)
THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS IN VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0003)
THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER OWN DESIRES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0004)
THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS EITHER VIOLENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0005)
THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO THE PEOPLE IS REGARDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0006)
TWO BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0007)
THEIR ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0008)
POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SUPERIOR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0009)
IF INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0010)
ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SCHOOL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0011)
BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY THE MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0012)
EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS I CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0013)
BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATES SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0014)
IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTHS OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0015)
AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF HIS LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0016)
BUT THIS NOTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0017)
INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTIONS TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0018)
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PUBLIC VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0019)
AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH HER GOLDEN EGGS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0020)
THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES AND SUBDUED BY CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0021)
SO THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0022)
FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THIS SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0023)
THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THEIR ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0024)
THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN THE CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0025)
THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THEIR ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0026)
AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED FOR THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0027)
BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0028)
AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS LABOR BRIGANDS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0029)
THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0030)
EVERY INCREASE OF THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBOURING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0031)
THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AS THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0032)
THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE GREATEST POSSIBLE EXPENSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0033)
AND BY THIS MEANS ALL THE CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0034)
THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY OFFICE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0035)
IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0036)
BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MET TO AVOID	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0037)
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES TO STRIFE WITH NEIGHBOURS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0038)
THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR OPERATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0039)
THAT DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE'S SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0040)
BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS A MANIFESTATION OF THAT CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0041)
GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE MADE ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0042)
THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST OUR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0043)
AND FOR THE SAKES OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0044)
I AM AFRAID FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0045)
NOT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0046)
WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER YET THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0047)
SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER THERE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0048)
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE AN RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0049)
WITHOUT THE STAGE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0050)
THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED EVEN SOME CENTURIES AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0051)
THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE ONE COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0052)
WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NOBLES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0053)
THE GOVERNMENT THEY CALL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0054)
AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THIS PURPOSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0055)
THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NATIVES EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0056)
EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO ONE CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0057)
TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY ONE IS NOT CAPABLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0058)
SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0059)
FOR A MAN OF THE FORMER WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0060)
SAY YOU KNOW ONE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0000)
CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CARY JACK AND SPARK PLUG	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0001)
KNOW WHO NEEDS THE JOB VAN THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0002)

ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM IT YOURSELF	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0004)
MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN EMIT STREET	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0005)
WHAT HE ADMITTED I DID	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0006)
CHRIS ASKED AS FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0007)
DO THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0008)
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO KNEADED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISSUS WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0009)
AND MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0010)
BITCH THEY AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED TO HIM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0011)
MIKE IS STANDING ON THE QUARTER	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0012)
AT SHUCKS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0013)
CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSES	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0014)
AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN TWO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE THE LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0015)
THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK AT THE BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON TO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BALCH SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0016)
A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND THE GREY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0017)
THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILLER AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THE JOB	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0018)
ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTNED ITSELF	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0019)
AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED HER HOUSE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0020)
HERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0021)
ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTRE THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GRAINED GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0022)
BUT THE NAMES STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME PETER SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0023)
HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF THAT	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0024)
HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EITHER SELL	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0025)
A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAMS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0026)
FOR THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0000)
SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOME ONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY YET UNEASILY ROUND HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0001)
WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW TOP WAS SOMBRE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0002)
HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS THRUST IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0003)
MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HER FACE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0004)
THE DOUBLE FORMS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0005)
LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WHERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0006)
CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE JUST THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0007)
CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS EYES CAME BACK TO HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0008)
YES YES SIR HE SAID	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0009)
I SAW THE SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0010)
HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE TOO	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0011)
JAKEE HARRIS'S NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0012)
I I JUST WONDERED IF THE BLICE WAS STILL OPEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0013)
WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND A GOOD HUMOUR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0014)
THEY GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0015)
WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE OF HIS GETTING THE JOB SIR	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0016)
BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALTOTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE THAPHIC SIGNALS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0017)
THE ROOMS SEEM OVERLY STILL	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0018)
THEN IN THAT DIRECTION HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0019)
THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE RIVER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0020)
ACROSS THE WATER WHERE IS THAT FREE WAY	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0021)
BUT IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKE STACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0022)
THE WARE HOUSES WERE STILL THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0023)
FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS PETER WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0024)
NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMP LIT SPACE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0025)
WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD BUT HALF A HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0026)
THE COURTYARD WAS SCARCELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON THE POST	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0027)
THE BOAT WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0028)
A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLANGE COURTYARD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0029)
THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE TABLE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0030)
MY WINDOW HAS A POWER IN THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0031)
THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS HEAVY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0000)
HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSTLER HIS HORARD OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0001)
CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HER TASK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0002)
ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLDFISH ON IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0003)
WHAT COULD ALLY DO FIRST	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0004)
HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY IT THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0005)
SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE ME	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0006)
MISTER WORKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET BACK HIS COURAGE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0007)
THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER RIGGER SAYS START AT ONCE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0008)
THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FAST	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0009)
HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE SEEMED FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0010)
HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT MOST BY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0011)
SEVENTY FOUR BOOK I THE RETURN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0012)
THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE HAD CURVED IN POINTING TOES	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0013)
THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA COMES TO CHRIS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0014)
IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BODY COME TO LIFE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0015)
HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE A BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0016)
BUT HOW DID ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE IT	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0017)
CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0018)
HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY HAD RESUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0019)
THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE THE INCREASED IN STORM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0020)
DUST CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THE THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0021)
CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIMES	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0022)
MISTER WORKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UP STAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAKE AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCIAN FUMED AND GLOWED	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0023)
WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD WATCHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0024)
IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESSES MELTED	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0025)
UNDER HIS EYES THE WIDED FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0026)
THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET A BOUQUET FALL	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0027)
AND THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0000)
GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OUT THAT WAY AT ALL	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0001)
NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY DAVID JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0002)
IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHAT I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0003)
THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHIRI	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0004)
WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON THEIR	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0005)
CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING UP TO HIS CABIN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0006)
CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEENING AND PENETRATING	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0007)
MISTER FINNENER WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0008)
HIS EYES ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0009)
THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDER	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0010)
THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY THAT I DID	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0011)
THE SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILIES	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0012)
HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT HALE STANDING BEFORE HIM	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0013)
WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU COME	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0014)
THIS SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN MY HANDS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0015)
YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY OR SIR	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0016)
CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S SOUND PINK FACE CREASED IN ITS WINNING SMILE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0017)
HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THAT SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0018)
CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0019)
WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR KIT OUGHT TO ASK	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0020)
I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THAT CREW KNOW IT	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0021)
I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN TALK FOR YOU	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0022)
NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER PARKER AND CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0023)
HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTIONILY COUNTED FOR	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0024)
THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN ONE LITTLE WHILE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0025)
WHEN CHURCHYARDS YANG	(533-1066-533-1066-0000)
I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR AND LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD	(533-1066-533-1066-0001)
I'M SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN HIS EXCITEMENT	(533-1066-533-1066-0002)
FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL IN THE LODGES	(533-1066-533-1066-0003)
OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR GENERAL ABILITIES	(533-1066-533-1066-0004)
MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NURSES TO NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0005)
I HAVE NONE I SAID ABSOLUTELY	(533-1066-533-1066-0006)
I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO ON WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL	(533-1066-533-1066-0007)
THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFULL NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0008)
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID	(533-1066-533-1066-0009)
PUT ON HEAVY SHOES OR SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING	(533-1066-533-1066-0010)
SIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0011)
THEY WERE TALKING COFIANTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED	(533-1066-533-1066-0012)
THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0013)
SO I ASKED NO QUESTIONS	(533-1066-533-1066-0014)
ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STUART WHEN HE RUSHED INTO A WIRE FENCE	(533-1066-533-1066-0015)
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I SAID	(533-1066-533-1066-0016)
THE LATTER WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT	(533-1066-533-1066-0017)
I CONFESSS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A CHEERFUL SPOT	(533-1066-533-1066-0018)
IN THE SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN SHARPLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0019)
IT IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES	(533-1066-533-1066-0020)
THE DOCTOR KEPT A QUEER LOOKOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED	(533-1066-533-1066-0021)
THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT TO BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY	(533-1066-533-1066-0022)
A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT TAKING THEM UP	(533-1066-533-1066-0023)
I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND SLIPPED DOWN	(533-1066-533-1066-0024)
BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY LEAVE	(533-131556-533-131556-0000)
FOR NONE COULD ENDURE IT AS HE HAS DONE OH	(533-131556-533-131556-0001)
THE WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE I HATE HIM	(533-131556-533-131556-0002)
I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING IT SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED	(533-131556-533-131556-0003)
I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD HER SO MINUTELY	(533-131556-533-131556-0004)
THEY HAD MISTAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH THE BOOK	(533-131556-533-131556-0005)
I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME AN APPEARANCE OF IT	(533-131556-533-131556-0006)
UPON PERUSING THIS SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT AT HER LIP	(533-131556-533-131556-0007)
YOU MAY GO MILICENT BUT SHE'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT	(533-131556-533-131556-0008)
I WILL OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE	(533-131556-533-131556-0009)
NOW YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS	(533-131556-533-131556-0010)
IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED WE SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE	(533-131556-533-131556-0011)
I ENJOY A MOUNTAIN RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THE THRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RESORTS	(533-131556-533-131556-0012)
SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER MOUTH AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE	(533-131556-533-131556-0013)
I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELINGS OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY	(533-131556-533-131556-0014)
YOU YES YES	(533-131556-533-131556-0015)
SUPPOSES I DO	(533-131556-533-131556-0016)
SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION OR PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW	(533-131556-533-131556-0017)
I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE VENTURED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE	(533-131556-533-131556-0018)

HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COURSE SERGY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THE FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0002)

TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0011)
HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAVE WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED A SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JURED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO HOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0012)

WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITING HIM AGAIN	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0000)
BUT HERRIMANN WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANER	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0001)

SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS PURPOSE	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0003)
THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF AN ORACLE	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0004)

A RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN UNADULTERATED CURSE	(5764-299665-5764-299665-0053)

IF THESE CORNERSTONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FOURTH ARE FROM END TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED	(5764-299665-5764-299665-0072)

IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN BACK OF THAT MATTER AND FORCE	(5764-299665-5764-299665-0074)

AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONSUMED	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0010)
HE REMEMBERED THE CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0011)

LARCH IN REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0014)
