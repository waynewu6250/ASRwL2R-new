I WILL MAKE THAT MY BUSINESS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0130)
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT FISHES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0000)
THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THIS SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0001)
FRUIT IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0002)
BUT TO DISTINGUISH THIS PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0003)
IF YOU DIP THE FINGER IN THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0004)
LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0005)
IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOMETHING TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0006)
BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF A SUGAR CANE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0007)
FOURTEEN EIGHTY NINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0008)
BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0009)
THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF A PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0010)
FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS IN SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0011)
THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN A STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURN EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0012)
IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON PIPS ARE PRESERVED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0013)
MARMALADES JAM AND FRUIT PASTE ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0014)
MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THERE PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0015)
THAT THEY MIGHT KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0016)
IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON THE TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0017)
CONFECTIONERY EIGHTEEN O EIGHT	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0018)
IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUISINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0019)
THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER BUT THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0020)
HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS ARE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0021)
THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES UPON STEMS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0022)
ASIS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0023)
AT DESSERT OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0024)
THE SPETTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0025)
THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THOSE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0026)
THERE WAS ONCE ON THE TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0000)
FROM THE VERY DAY THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0001)
BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORST	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0002)
KISS ME GIRL SAID THE HAND	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0003)
BUT WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0004)
THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET OFF FROM THE KING'S PALACE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0005)
AT LAST WE CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0006)
WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AS SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0007)
WHAT WAS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0008)
ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME TO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0009)
SHE BOWED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0010)
OUT UPON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0011)
I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN AGAIN SAID SHE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0012)
THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0013)
NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY PRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0014)
WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOWLS ASKED THE KING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0000)
THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FALLS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0001)
HADT THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0002)
YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE JEW	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0003)
HE HAS GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0004)
THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE PROMISED HIS BROTHER	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0005)
WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTIFF SHE CALLED TO HIM	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0006)
COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0007)
THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF A ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0008)

I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SINDERLAND	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0024)
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE IS OLD	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0000)
THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0001)

HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0005)

ONLY ONE RING IS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0007)
SO REGAN MADE THE SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0008)
THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS BROTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0009)
SO SIGURD SAID THAT SORT WOULD DO	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0010)

SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNER ON A STEAK AND ROASTED IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0017)
THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFFNER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0018)
THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HINFFELD TO THE PLACE WHERE BRINHILD SLEEPS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0019)

IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAS CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0018)
WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED UPON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0019)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POORER PEASANT	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0020)
MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVERRIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0021)
THE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNCILLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0022)
TO HIM WHO CAN BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0023)
AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRI'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0024)
BUT ETHELREED HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0025)
SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE ISAULT	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0026)
HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARISE LATER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0000)
HE HAS BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0001)
HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0002)
TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER TO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BATLIKE SOULS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0003)
MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REGARDED THE TRUE LIGHT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0004)
THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED THEM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0005)
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT HERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0006)
HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THE FATHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0007)
HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS THAT OCCURRED TO HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0008)
IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN VARIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0009)
THEY STILL ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0010)
REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAYS MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0011)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFYRAC	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0012)
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0013)
SILVER GOLD THERE IT IS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0014)
YOU WILL HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0015)
THIS WILL BE ENOUGH	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0016)
NO IT IS NO GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0017)
DO YOU KNOW GERMAN NOW	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0018)
IT IS BADLY PAID WORK ONE CAN LIVE BY IT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0019)
THE CLOSE DEALER WAS SENT FOR	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0020)
HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS AND WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0021)
HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR TWENTY FIVE FRANCS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0022)
HELLO I HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0023)
THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAS TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0024)
I HAVE TWO FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0025)
WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0026)
ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTEEN PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0027)
MARIUS SENT BACK THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0028)
AT THAT MOMENT HE HAS THREE FRANCS LEFT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0029)
HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS A MOTHER	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0000)
BEFORE HER HE TRIED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0001)
THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0002)
WELL DOCTOR DECIDE YOUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0003)
WAS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0004)
AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OFF WITH A SIGH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0005)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTIVELY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0006)
AND THERE WERE INDICATIONS MALUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0007)
THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESSES WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0008)
YES IT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0009)
BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKI BRIDGE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE HER ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0010)
SHE ASKED AH IT IS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0011)
O WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0012)
AND HOW A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0013)
WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION AND FOR LOWERING IT	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0014)
THE ARMY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0015)
BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING OUT REMINISCENCES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0016)
AND THEN MY MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0017)
AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET HIM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0018)
OH TIME'S UP AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0019)
A CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0020)
OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCE COME THIS WAY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0021)
AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT IN THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0022)
WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYE FILLED WITH TEARS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0023)
SHE ASKED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0024)
EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE WAS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0025)
IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0026)
THAT CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0027)
NERVOUS IRRITABLY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0028)
AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0029)
AT THIS QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0030)
FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0031)
IT WAS AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0032)
THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KATY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0033)
EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE LOWER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0000)
THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0001)
IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTEREST FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0002)
THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTIONS OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0003)
THE MAN WHO WAS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0004)
THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS UNDOUBTEDLY VIOLENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0005)
THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0006)
THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO THE SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0007)
THIS ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0008)
POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIANS AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0009)
INDEED IT WOULD NOT BE OTHERWISE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0010)
ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS CAN THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0011)
BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANISATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0012)
IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0013)
BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THIS STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0014)
IT WAS PRODUCED ON THE ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0015)
AFTER CONQUESTS THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0016)
BUT HIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0017)
INTERNAL DISSENTIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0018)
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIVES OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0019)
AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CAN NOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0020)
THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONTRAST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0021)
AND SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0022)
FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THE TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0023)
THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING UPON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0024)
THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0025)
THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BOW UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0026)
AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ENEMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0027)
THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0028)
AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS OWN BRIGANDS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0029)
THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0030)
EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBOURING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0031)
THE DESPOTISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0032)
THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCE HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0033)
BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0034)
THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIFORM MILITARY SERVICE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0035)
IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIMS OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0036)
BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED ON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0037)
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THEIR INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBOURS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0038)
THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOUR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0039)
THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE AND SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0040)
THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS A MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0041)
GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0042)
THEY ARE USED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0043)
AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0044)
I'M EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0045)
EXCEPT THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0046)
WE KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0047)
SO THAT THIS JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0048)
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHALL NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0049)
WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0050)
THE ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0051)
THE GREATEST EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0052)
WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WILL BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBOURS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0053)
THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH HIS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0054)
AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WILL BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0055)
THE POWER OF THIS STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0056)
EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH HIS STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0057)
TO RESISTANCE WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0058)
SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH SIDES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSOR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0059)
FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0060)
SAY YOU KNOW ANYTHING	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0000)
CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASH LIGHT TO A CAR JACK AND SPARK PLUG	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0001)
KNOW WHO NEEDS THE JOB BAN THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0002)
O J HE SAID	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0003)
ONLY WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0004)
MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT ON EMS STREET	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0005)
YES HE ADMITTED I DID	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0006)
CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0007)
THEN HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0008)
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREET WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0009)
MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTLY ENCOURAGED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0010)
BITCH YOU AREN'T GOING AFTER ALL JUST TURNED TO HIM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0011)
MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE COUNTER	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0012)
OR SHUCKS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0013)
CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON A HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0014)
AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE THE LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0015)
THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK AT THE BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ONTO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0016)
A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND BLACK CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0017)
THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THIS JOB	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0018)
ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED WHERE HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0019)
AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL THEY REACHED THE HOUSE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0020)
THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY BUSHES	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0021)
ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREAT GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0022)
BUT THE NAMES STILL SHOWED IN THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0023)
HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO IN MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0024)
HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE NEVER SELL	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0025)
A SUDDEN CARHORN WOKE HIM FROM THIS DREAM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0026)
AND THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0000)
SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY ROUND HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0001)
WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0002)
HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0003)
MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF THE LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0004)
THE DOUBLES OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0005)
LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WITH THE OLD MAN'S EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0006)
CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL HERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0007)
CHRIS SWALLOWED THEN HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0008)
YES SIR HE ANSWERED	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0009)
I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS A JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0010)
HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MY OWN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0011)
JAMIE HARRIS'S NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0012)
I I JUST WONDERED IF THE PRICE WAS STILL OPEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0013)
WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTY STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0014)
HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0015)
WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE HIS GETTING THE JOB SIR	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0016)
BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WALLUTTER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARDS THE THAPHIC SIGNALS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0017)
THE ROOF SEEMED OVERLY STILL	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0018)
IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0019)
THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN ACROSS THE WATER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0020)
ACROSS THE WATER WHERE'S THE FREE WAY	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0021)
IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WAS THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKE STACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0022)
THE WARE HOUSES WERE STILL THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0023)
FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THAT WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0024)
NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLIT STREET	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0025)
WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE AROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0026)
THE COURT YARD WAS SPECIALLY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0027)
THAT POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0028)
A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLANGED COURT YARD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0029)
THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0030)
MY WINDOW IS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0031)
THAT LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0000)
HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSTLER HIS HOARD OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0001)
CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF THIS TASK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0002)
ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BALL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0003)
WHAT SHOULD ALLAH DO FIRST	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0004)
HOW YOU'VE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0005)
SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T TURN BACK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0006)
MISTER BOOKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0007)
THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER VIGGER SAID START AT ONCE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0008)
A SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0009)
HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED TO THE FINAL WORDS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0010)
HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUTLESS BY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0011)
SEVENTY FOUR SPOKE ONE THE RETURN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0012)
THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE OF CURVED UP POINTING TOES	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0013)
THEN ALL AT ONCE THAT IDEA CAME TO CHRIS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0014)
IF HE IS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0015)
HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND A HAPPY COMPANION	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0016)
BUT HOW DO ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0017)
CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER BICKER'S DOOR	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0018)
HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY HE ASSUMED ITS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0019)
THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE INCREASE IN STORM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0020)
DUST CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE HIS TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0021)
CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXT AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0022)
MISTER WORKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED CREAK AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PHOCIAN FUMED AND GLOWED	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0023)
WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOORS SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF A NEGRO BOY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0024)
IT WAS AS IF THE STEEPNESS MELTED	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0025)
UNDER HIS EYES THE GOLDEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0026)
THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED THAT LET THE BOUQUET FALL	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0027)
THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0000)
GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS A DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0001)
NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ALBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT DOWN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0002)
IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW YOU I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0003)
A MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHITI	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0004)
WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON HERE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0005)
CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING BACK TO HIS CABIN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0006)
SURELY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0007)
MISTER FINNEY WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0008)
HIS VOICE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0009)
THE CAPTAIN SATE FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0010)
THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CAN NOT SAY THAT I DO	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0011)
A SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0012)
HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWISE IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0013)
WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU KNOW	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0014)
THAT SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0015)
YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHALL NOT TRY SIR	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0016)
CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED ON ITS WINNING SMILE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0017)
HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT RESULT WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0018)
CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME UNDERSTOOD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0019)
WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS SOUGHT TO ASK	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0020)
I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS THE CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0021)
I SHOULD SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0022)
NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER HOOKER AND CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0023)
HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0024)
THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME A LITTLE WHILE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0025)
WHEN CHURCHYARDS YON	(533-1066-533-1066-0000)
I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED A THOUSAND OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD	(533-1066-533-1066-0001)
I AM SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I'VE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEMED TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT	(533-1066-533-1066-0002)
FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR IN THE LODGE	(533-1066-533-1066-0003)
OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES	(533-1066-533-1066-0004)
MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TONIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0005)
I HAVE NONE I SAID HASTILY	(533-1066-533-1066-0006)
I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING UNUSUAL	(533-1066-533-1066-0007)
THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE THE PEACEFUL NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0008)
SOMETHING IS GOING TO APPEAR HE SAID	(533-1066-533-1066-0009)
PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING	(533-1066-533-1066-0010)
LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHILE I WENT UPSTAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0011)
THEY WERE TALKING COFILY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED	(533-1066-533-1066-0012)
THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINDERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0013)
I HAVE ASKED NO QUESTIONS	(533-1066-533-1066-0014)
ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STUART WHEN HE RAN INTO THE WIRE FENCE	(533-1066-533-1066-0015)
I ALREADY KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED	(533-1066-533-1066-0016)
THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEHOW WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT	(533-1066-533-1066-0017)
I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A BEAUTIFUL SPOT	(533-1066-533-1066-0018)
IN DESPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN SHARPLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0019)
IT IS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES	(533-1066-533-1066-0020)
THE DOCTOR KEPT A KEEN LOOKOUT AND NO ONE APPEARED	(533-1066-533-1066-0021)
THERE'S ONE THING SURE I LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY	(533-1066-533-1066-0022)
A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A HANDIER AT BEARING FOLKS THAN AT TIGGING THEM UP	(533-1066-533-1066-0023)
I HELD ON TO IT FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN	(533-1066-533-1066-0024)
HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY GO	(533-131556-533-131556-0000)
FOR NONE COULD ENDURE ME AS HE HAD DONE OH	(533-131556-533-131556-0001)
THAT WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM	(533-131556-533-131556-0002)
I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELINGS HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED	(533-131556-533-131556-0003)
I HAVE DONE WELL TO REPORT THEM SO MINUTELY	(533-131556-533-131556-0004)
THEY HAD MISTAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK	(533-131556-533-131556-0005)
I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU BUT AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT	(533-131556-533-131556-0006)
UPON PERUSING IT SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP	(533-131556-533-131556-0007)
YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND SHE'LL FOLLOW IN WHILE MILICENT WENT	(533-131556-533-131556-0008)
WOULD OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE	(533-131556-533-131556-0009)
YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS	(533-131556-533-131556-0010)
IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I SAID I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE	(533-131556-533-131556-0011)
I ENJOY A MOONLIGHT RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THE SHRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RESORTS	(533-131556-533-131556-0012)
SHE COLORED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER CHEEK AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE	(533-131556-533-131556-0013)
I WATCHED A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY	(533-131556-533-131556-0014)
YES PERHAPS	(533-131556-533-131556-0015)
SUPPOSING I DO	(533-131556-533-131556-0016)
SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH A ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW	(533-131556-533-131556-0017)
I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE UTTERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE	(533-131556-533-131556-0018)
IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR ADEPTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE	(533-131556-533-131556-0019)
I SHALL NOT TELL THEM	(533-131556-533-131556-0020)
GIVE ME NO THANKS IT WAS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I REFRAIN	(533-131556-533-131556-0021)
AND MILICENT WILL TELL HER	(533-131556-533-131556-0022)
I WOULD NOT FOR MUCH THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF A RELATION	(533-131556-533-131556-0023)
YOU USE HARD WORDS MISS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU	(533-131556-533-131556-0024)
HOW DARE YOU MENTION ITS NAME TO ME	(533-131556-533-131556-0025)

SHE WOULD APPEAL HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0002)
SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITE	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0003)
THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET A DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0004)

OF THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0016)
THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0017)
COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIE	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0018)
WITH YOUR TALENTS HE WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0019)

IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATIONS THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0005)
THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0006)
THESE THINGS OF THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0007)
AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE HE DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANCE AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0008)

SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING SWEETNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0023)
HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNA'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0024)

POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BEOTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0000)
THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LOU'S SISTER	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0001)
RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISIT OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0002)
HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE WOULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0003)

OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING AND HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0009)
SHE HAD ERECTED IT TO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0010)
SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME THE BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0011)

SURE HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET OUT	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0026)
MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOES TALKED IN THE FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBOURS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0027)

AND I HAVE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0033)
IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THAT A BIT	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0034)
BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD TO HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE COLONEL	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0035)
THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE LITTLE TICKING WATCH	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0036)
A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0037)

WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO TO IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0046)
RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTEEN PROPOSITION	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0047)
AT FIRST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0048)
AND YOU I DON'T WANT EITHER	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0049)

AN THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0059)
CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY LAID THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0000)
AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO LIFT THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0001)

WELL I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU CAN	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0005)
IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT A HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0006)

YOU DON'T MEAN THE LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0008)
THE GENERAL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0009)
AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS MOST UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0010)
HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD OFTEN BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0011)
SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE BUT SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0012)
BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO DIFFERENCE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0013)
LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THIS SEPARATION	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0014)
SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY PERSONAL FEE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0015)
NO BUT HE WILL AND I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0016)

GRAVE AND EVEN REVEREND THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALL ROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0021)
LATCH HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0022)

IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RACHFORD HAD MARRIED	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0024)
TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0025)
AND IN THE WAY IT WAS TRUE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0026)
SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0027)
AFTER THAT MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0028)

BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANYTHING AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0030)
IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN HERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0031)

THE PIGEON COURTS HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION	(7105-2340-7105-2340-0032)
PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A GOLD WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE	(7105-2340-7105-2340-0033)
MISS PETER TURNED TO HER GUEST WITH CONFIDENTIAL COYNESS	(7105-2340-7105-2340-0034)
PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS A TRANSCEND TO FAMILY GOOD LORD	(7105-2340-7105-2340-0035)
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A CLLEPTOMANIA LIKE COUSIN SNATCHER	(7105-2340-7105-2340-0036)
BRAVE LITTLE WOMAN SAID PETER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT	(7105-2340-7105-2340-0037)
I'M THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0000)
DONT CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO COME	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0001)
AND THEN YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0002)
I WISH YOU BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0003)
THAT MY FATHER SIR RASDON GRAHAM HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0004)
HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS WE SHALL NOT TELL	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0005)
PRAY PRAY SAID YOU WILL NOT ARCHIE WAS SILENT	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0006)
THEN AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARK UTTERLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0007)
HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD REYSTROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0008)
AND WHAT COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0009)
COLD WATER CAME OF THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0010)
I LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0011)
FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO COULD STOP AT NOTHING	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0012)
NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME OVER	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0013)
THE KISS HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0014)
TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HIDDEN TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0015)
THE WINDOW WAS BARRED AND HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0016)
NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTLEPIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0017)
YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE WOULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0018)
NO IT WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO THAT	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0019)
SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0020)
THE NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN TWO PLACES	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0021)
HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A WOMAN'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0022)
THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE AND THE HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0023)
THE FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0024)

TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERY THING CLEAR AWAY TONIGHT	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0004)
THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHIE REINSTROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0005)
WHAT A QUEER DREAM HE THOUGHT OF HIMSELF	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0006)
BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISSUS GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEALE THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0007)
AND WHY DID ANDY CALLED MISTER GURR FATHER	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0008)
THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THAT KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0009)
AN I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0010)

WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAS BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0012)
ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD REIN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARED NOT HUNT HIM DOWN	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0013)
OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARD THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0014)
