1272-128104-0000 MISTER QUALTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL
1272-128104-0001 NOR WAS MISTER QUILTER'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MADDER
1272-128104-0002 HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CRISPNESS AND ROAST BEEF LOOMING BEFORE US SIMILES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OCCUR MOST READILY TO THE MIND
1272-128104-0003 HE HAS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FREDERIC LE BRETON'S WORK IS REALLY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT LITTLE OF ROCKY ITHACA
1272-128104-0004 LINENELL'S PICTURES ARE A SORT OF UPGUARDS AND ADAMS PAINTINGS AND MASON'S EXQUISITE IDYLLS ARE AS NATIONAL AS A JINGO POEM MISTER BURKEETT FOSTER'S LANDSCAPES SMILE AT ONE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT MISTER PARKER USED TO FLASH HIS TEETH AND MISTER JOHN COLLIER GIVES HIS SITTER A CHEERFUL SLAP ON THE BACK BEFORE HE SAYS LIKE A SHAMPOOER IN A TURKISH BATH NEXT MAN
1272-128104-0005 IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LUMINOUS THESE CRITICISMS ARE HOW DISTINCT IN EXPRESSION
1272-128104-0006 IN THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART MISTER QUILTER WRITES WITH EQUAL LUCIDITY
1272-128104-0007 PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MATHEMATICS AND FINISH OF ART IS ADDING MORE FACT
1272-128104-0008 AS FOR ETCHINGS THEY ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND MODERN
1272-128104-0009 HE LAMENTS MOST BITTERLY THE DIVORCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DECORATIVE ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKE A CUSTOMARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND REMINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHAEL ANGELO WAS THE FURNISHING UPHOLSTERER
1272-128104-0010 NEAR THE FIRE AND THE ORNAMENTS FRED BROUGHT HOME FROM INDIA ON THE BATTLE BOARD
1272-128104-0011 IN FACT HE IS QUITE SEVERE UPON MISTER RUSKIN FOR NOT RECOGNISING THAT A PICTURE SHOULD DENOTE THE FRAILTY OF MAN AND REMARKS WITH PLEASING COURTESY AND FELICITOUS GRACE THAT MANY PHASES OF FEELING
1272-128104-0012 ONLY UNFORTUNATELY HIS OWN WORK NEVER DOES BE GOOD
1272-128104-0013 MISTER QUILDER HAS MISSED HIS CHANCE FOR HE HAS FAILED EVEN TO MAKE HIMSELF THE TUPPER OF PAINTING
1272-128104-0014 BY HARRY QUILTON M A
1272-135031-0000 BECAUSE YOU ARE SLEEPING INSTEAD OF CONQUERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAD BECOME A FIDDLE WITHOUT A BOW WHILE POOR SHAGGY SITS THERE A COOING DOVE
1272-135031-0001 SHE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED POLYCHROME WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEEZE INTO THE ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCES WITH MUCH INTEREST
1272-135031-0002 I HAVE REMAINED A PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISH TO BE ONE AND WITH THIS HE STEPPED FORWARDS AND BURST THE STOUT CHAINS AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THREADS
1272-135031-0003 THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE RATS AND OPENED THE DOOR
1272-135031-0004 THE QUEEN HAS FLED IN DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU
1272-135031-0005 I BEGGED RUGGEDO LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT WOULD NOT DO SO
1272-135031-0006 I ALSO OFFERED TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE BUT HE DID NOT GO
1272-135031-0007 SHE EATS AND SLEEPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW KING
1272-135031-0008 I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID
1272-135031-0009 AND HE DOESN'T WORK AT ALL
1272-135031-0010 IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS BY GNOMES WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WORRIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY
1272-135031-0011 NOT LIKELY RETURNED KALIKO
1272-135031-0012 WHERE IS MY BOY NOW
1272-135031-0013 INQUIRED JIMMIE IN THE METAL FOREST
1272-135031-0014 THERE IS THAT
1272-135031-0015 THAT MIDDLE FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DOMED CAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED KALIKO
1272-135031-0016 KALINGO HESITATED
1272-135031-0017 HOWEVER IF WE LOOK SHARP WE WILL BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF THESE SECRET WAYS
1272-135031-0018 OH NO I'M QUITE SURE HE WOULDN'T
1272-135031-0019 THAT'S FANNY REMARKED BETSY THOUGHTFULLY
1272-135031-0020 I DON'T BELIEVE ANNE DID ANY MAGIC OR SHE'D HAVE WORKED IT BEFORE
1272-135031-0021 I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHE
1272-135031-0022 NO AGREED KALIKO
1272-135031-0023 KALIKO WENT TO THE BIG GONG AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS RUGGEDO USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED A SUMMONS
1272-135031-0024 HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN KALIKO FIRST POWDERED THE GONG AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RUGGEDO'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGGEDO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD
1272-141231-0000 A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE THERE I EXIST
1272-141231-0001 SWEAT COVERED BRION'S BODY TRICKLING THROUGH THE TIGHT LOIN CLOTH THAT WAS THE ONLY GARMENT HE WORE
1272-141231-0002 THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVERSTRAINED EYES EVEN THE SOARING ARENA AROUND HIM WITH THEIR THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
1272-141231-0003 THAT INSTANT OF PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST
1272-141231-0004 ONE MINNIT A VOICE SAID AND A TIME BUZZER SOUNDED
1272-141231-0005 A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY KNEADED EVERY FRACTION OF IT
1272-141231-0006 THE BUZZERS WHIRR TRIGGERED HIS MUSCLES INTO A COMPLETE RELAXATION
1272-141231-0007 ONLY HIS FEET AND LUNGS WORKED ON AT A STRONG MEASURED RATE
1272-141231-0008 HE WAS IN REVERIE SLIDING DOWN THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
1272-141231-0009 THE CONTESTANTS IN THE TWENTIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST HOWEVER NIGHTS IN THE DORMITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH
1272-141231-0010 PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LATE NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICLES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS
1272-141231-0011 THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A HARSH URGENCY CLEARLY USED IN COMMAND
1272-141231-0012 I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRAND IS THE ONE I MUST SEE AND STAND ASIDE
1272-141231-0013 THEY TWENTIES
1272-141231-0014 HE MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRUDER SAID QUICKLY PUT THAT AWAY YOU'RE BEING A FOOL NOW
1272-141231-0015 THERE WAS SILENCE NOW AND STILL WONDERING BRION WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP
1272-141231-0016 TEN TEN SECONDS
1272-141231-0017 HE CALLED THE HANDLER WHO WAS KNEADING HIS ACHING MUSCLES
1272-141231-0018 A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WITH AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORES OF ENERGY
1272-141231-0019 THERE COULD BE LITTLE HEART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OF FENCING
1272-141231-0020 SO THRUST AND PARRY AND VICTORY TO THE STRONGER
1272-141231-0021 EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE TWENTIES HAD HIS OWN TRAINED TRICKS
1272-141231-0022 THERE APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEATH DRAMA AS IF THE TWO WAS INEXTRICABLY LINKED INTO ONE
1272-141231-0023 THIS STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOME ONE IN A TRANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS
1272-141231-0024 THIS IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONSCIOUS
1272-141231-0025 OTHERS HAVE DIED BEFORE DURING THE TWENTIES AND DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT
1272-141231-0026 BREATHING DEEPLY BRION SOFTLY SPOKE THE AUTOP HYPNOTIC PHRASES AND TRIGGERED THE PROCESS
1272-141231-0027 WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FOIL FROM A SECOND'S STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD
1272-141231-0028 AROGUE LOOKED AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED
1272-141231-0029 HE SAID IT WAS A LAST BURST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSE THEY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION
1272-141231-0030 BRION SAW SOMETHING CLOSE TO PANIC UPON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE WHEN THE MAN FINALLY RECOGNISED HIS ERROR
1272-141231-0031 A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM AEROLD BRION SENSED IT AND KNEW THE FIFTH POINT WAS HIS
1272-141231-0032 THEN THE POWERFUL TWISTER THRUST IT ASIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD
1462-170138-0000 HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONGST THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF ERNEST DAUSEN ET CETERA
1462-170138-0001 HUGH'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND HE'S QUITE INEXPRESSIBLE
1462-170138-0002 I HAPPENED TO HAVE MC CONNALL'S BOX FOR TONIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
1462-170138-0003 ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED MILLY
1462-170138-0004 HOWEVER I ALWAYS KNEW SHE HAD IT IN HER
1462-170138-0005 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER BAYNE HILL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
1462-170138-0006 WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE SCENE BEING THE INTERIOR OF AN CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
1462-170138-0007 AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW OLIVER'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE
1462-170138-0008 OF COURSE HILDA IS IRISH THE BURGONES HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
1462-170138-0009 IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IN A LONDON THEATER
1462-170138-0010 WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GAUCSONS WHICH SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR
1462-170138-0011 AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WELL BACK OF PHILLY'S BOROUGH WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PRIMROSES FOR HER DONKEY
1462-170138-0012 MC CONNALL LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER
1462-170138-0013 THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MAIN HALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET CANDID EYES AND MADE A WRY FACE
1462-170138-0014 HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DODGING BEHINDS AS HE WENT
1462-170138-0015 I DARESAY IT'S QUITE TRUE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING ELSE
1462-170138-0016 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY CLEAN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
1462-170138-0017 SIR HARRY NOW BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKYO
1462-170138-0018 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S COMING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
1462-170138-0019 THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEEDY DEAR CHILD
1462-170138-0020 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES USUALLY
1462-170138-0021 HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAINHALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WESTMARE OF COURSE THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MOUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOWELL
1462-170138-0022 IN A MINUTE PEGGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLAUDED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST
1462-170138-0023 IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH AMAZEMENT SIR HARRY'S JUDICIAL FROWN
1462-170138-0024 HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAMED FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAYOR HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT
1462-170138-0025 ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASSES HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HILDA
1462-170138-0026 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SISTER
1462-170138-0027 IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND LOVELY
1462-170142-0000 THE LAST THREE DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
1462-170142-0001 EMERGING TO EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
1462-170142-0002 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED A CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
1462-170142-0003 THE ROAD WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
1462-170142-0004 A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DUSK OUTSIDE
1462-170142-0005 SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE HAD IT
1462-170142-0006 SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT THE HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
1462-170142-0007 I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLE
1462-170142-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME BARTIE AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
1462-170142-0009 HE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
1462-170142-0010 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTIE SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
1462-170142-0011 HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS THOUGH THE AIR WERE HEAVY
1462-170142-0012 HILDA WATCHED HER FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
1462-170142-0013 IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE DOES IT
1462-170142-0014 I ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW
1462-170142-0015 IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTES
1462-170142-0016 I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE THREE LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
1462-170142-0017 I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF ANY
1462-170142-0018 THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND WOMEN
1462-170142-0019 AT THIS WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOUR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIP LASH
1462-170142-0020 SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
1462-170142-0021 COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT EVERY ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
1462-170142-0022 HE DROPT BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE
1462-170142-0023 I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS UNTIL I AM WORN OUT
1462-170142-0024 OUT THE VERY FIRST
1462-170142-0025 HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE
1462-170142-0026 SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU UNHAPPY THEN AT ALL
1462-170142-0027 SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ELIZABETH TOO
1462-170142-0028 PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS CLOAK SLEEVE
1462-170142-0029 YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID GENTLY
1462-170142-0030 I UNDERSTAND CHARTLEY I WAS WRONG
1462-170142-0031 SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAK OF HIS CHAIR
1462-170142-0032 YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE ANSWERED
1462-170142-0033 BARTLE LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
1462-170142-0034 IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAR BRAKE HILDA
1462-170142-0035 OH CHARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
1462-170142-0036 YOU ASKED ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANTED ME
1462-170142-0037 I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMEBODY
1462-170142-0038 HILDA SANK ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
1462-170142-0039 YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKE THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
1462-170142-0040 AND THEN I CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
1462-170142-0041 SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF HE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
1462-170142-0042 YOU DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
1462-170145-0000 UPON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
1462-170145-0001 OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LONG OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR
1462-170145-0002 HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM CAREFULLY
1462-170145-0003 OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OWE ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT I SAIL ON TUESDAY
1462-170145-0004 I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M COMING NOW
1462-170145-0005 LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND MY BOOTS THEIR OOZING WATER
1462-170145-0006 IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONE TO HIM OR ANYTHING
1462-170145-0007 I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A MATTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
1462-170145-0008 HE PAUSED AND NEVER DID TO ME
1462-170145-0009 OH BARTLEY DID YOU RIDE TO ME
1462-170145-0010 ALEXANDER LISTENED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
1462-170145-0011 I KNOW I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING
1462-170145-0012 HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER NECK
1462-170145-0013 AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE DOING THAT
1462-170145-0014 BUT WHEN I CAME I SAW I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
1462-170145-0015 I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME INTO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
1462-170145-0016 THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMPOSED
1462-170145-0017 I ARE GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON
1462-170145-0018 ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE SIMPLY
1462-170145-0019 THEN YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
1462-170145-0020 YES I DO VERY WELL
1462-170145-0021 ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY AND
1462-170145-0022 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I WOULDN'T AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
1673-143396-0000 A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOUR OF THE FIRST PROSELYTE IS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIONITES OR AT LEAST THE NAZARENES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAIC RITES
1673-143396-0001 THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THE INFANT CREED WOULD BE VARIOUSLY MOULDED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
1673-143396-0002 YET THE MOST CHARITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THESE SECTARIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND TRUE DIVINITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0003 HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY INTO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASE IN STATURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS
1673-143396-0004 HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRATES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAIN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HUMANITY
1673-143396-0005 THE SON OF A VIRGIN GENERATED BY THE INEFFABLE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM
1673-143396-0006 NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THE AEONS THE LOGOS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
1673-143396-0007 BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNITY AND INHERENT PRIVITY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRINCIPAL CHURCHES OF THE EAST
1673-143396-0008 MANY AMONG THE GENTILE PROSELYTES REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A CELESTIAL SPIRIT AN UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR A DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY ABJURED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0009 HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OMNIPOTENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ASSURANCE ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
1673-143396-0010 BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAD ENCOURAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOCETES WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST WAS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE BODY
1673-143396-0011 A PHOEBUS THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD'S THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPAIRING A DAILY WASTE BY THE DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
1673-143396-0012 IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NAZARETH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MARY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENTS TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE SUPREME AND SUPREME DEITY
1673-143396-0013 WHEN THE MESSIAH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE CHRIST AN IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE PLARIMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE
1673-143396-0014 BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FATE OF AN INNOCENT MARTHA AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFANE
1673-143396-0015 THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTARIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE LITTLE SYSTEM OF CORINTHUS
1673-143396-0016 THE WORTHY FRIEND OF ATHANASIUS THE WORTHY ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY WRESTLED WITH THE ARIANS AND POLYTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE ESCAPED THE RIGOUR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITERAL AND ALLEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES
1673-143396-0017 YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED AT HIS OWN RASHNESS APOLLINARIS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLANATIONS
1673-143396-0018 HE ACQUIESCED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHER'S BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND SENSITIVE SOUL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LOGOS FOR INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPLE IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE
1673-143396-0019 BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALLIANCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WE STILL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANTIAL INDISSOLUBLE AND EVERLASTING UNION OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN AND THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY WITH A REASONABLE SOUL AND HUMAN FLESH

174-168635-0004 ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND TWENTY AND COSETTE EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED TOGETHER INTO A SORT OF INEFFABLE LIGHT
174-168635-0005 COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD ALSO UNKNOWN TO HERSELF BECOME ANOTHER BEING LITTLE THING

174-168635-0011 WHEREFORE JEAN VALJEAN HAD CHOSEN HIS REFUGE WELL
174-168635-0012 HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSIONED THE YOUNG WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN

174-168635-0020 PERHAPS HE WALKED WITH NO LESS INDECISION THAN COSETTE

174-84280-0001 IT SEEMS TO ME MORE AND MORE AS I LIVE LONGER THAT MOST POETRY AND MOST LITERATURE AND PARTICULARLY THE LITERATURE OF THE PAST IS DISCORDANT WITH THAT VASTNESS AND VARIETY THE RESERVES AND RESOURCES AND RECUPERATIONS OF LIFE AS WE LIVE IT TODAY
174-84280-0002 IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE UNDER CRUDER AND MORE RADIANT CONDITIONS THAN OURS LIVED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVED AND HATED MORE NAIVELY AGED SOONER AND DIED YOUNGER THAN WE DO
174-84280-0003 WE REACH WIDER LAST LONGER AND ESCAPE MORE AND MORE FROM INTENSITY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING

1988-147956-0028 AS I CAME UP HE TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY DOWN INTO MY FACE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS
1988-147956-0029 I BECAME SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED FOR I WAS USED TO BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED MY ELDERS
1988-148538-0000 IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BURSTS OF TUMULTUOUS AND BOISTEROUS GAIETY WHICH STRIKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES OF DEMOCRACIES ARE NOT FOND OF BEING THUS VIOLENTLY BROKEN IN UPON AND THEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELVES WITHOUT REGRET
1988-148538-0001 A AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEISURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESORT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUE TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
1988-148538-0002 I THINK THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE
1988-148538-0003 THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORMED DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES
1988-148538-0004 THEN THERE ARE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE GREATLY ENGROSSED BY THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE FORTUNE
1988-148538-0005 I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO IF THE THINGS WE READ OF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCRACIES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LATTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME
1988-148538-0006 IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH HE UNCEASINGLY PURSUES BUT AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EITHER
1988-148538-0007 CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTUOUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
1988-148538-0008 THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIENT OF THE SMALLEST CENSURE AND INSATIABLE IN PRAISE
1988-148538-0009 IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY HE LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE AYE HE REPLIES THERE'S NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD
1988-148538-0010 IF THEY APPLAUD THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITANTS ENJOY HE ANSWERS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT
1988-148538-0011 IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE GREAT POSSESS IMMENSE PRIVILEGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIZE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ACCRUE TO THEM
1988-148538-0012 THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF VAUNTING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERY ONE PERCEIVES AND NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEAR TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION
1988-148538-0013 THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
1988-148538-0014 WHEN AN ARISTOCRACY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HAUGHTY FORM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL OTHER CLASSES OF THE NATION
1988-148538-0015 THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PUERILE JEALOUSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MEN OF DEMOCRACIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLER ADVANTAGES WHICH THEIR EQUALS CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PARADE OSTENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSSESSION
1988-24833-0000 THOSE TWO STRAY KITTENS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME
1988-24833-0001 SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER KAT HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE'S IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHASES THEM FOR FUN NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY SLEEPING
1988-24833-0002 SHE DOESN'T PICK THEM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN HER ROOM SHE DOESN'T GIVE HER ASTHMA
1988-24833-0003 WHAT ARE YOU GETTING RID OF THESE CATS I'M NOT FIXING TO START AN ANNEX TO KATE'S CAT HOME
1988-24833-0004 RIGHT AWAY WHEN I BRING HOME MY NEW PROGRAMME SHE SAYS HOW COME YOU'RE TAKING ONE LESS COURSE THIS HALF
1988-24833-0005 I EXPLAIN THAT I'M TAKING MUSIC AND ALSO BIOLOGICAL ALGEBRA ENGLISH AND FRENCH MUSIC HE SNORTS
1988-24833-0006 PEP IT'S A CHORUS
1988-24833-0007 HE DOES AND FOR ONCE I WIN AROUND I GET MUSIC FOR THIS SEMESTER
1988-24833-0008 'LL BE LUCKY IF I HAVE TIME TO BREATHE
1988-24833-0009 SOMETIMES SCHOOLS DO LET KIDS TAKE A LOT OF SOFTER COURSES AND THEN THEY'RE OUT ON A LIMB LATER HUMPH
1988-24833-0010 SO HE CARES HUMP
1988-24833-0011 BESIDES SAYS TOM PERHAPS THE REASON YOU AND YOUR FATHER ARE ALWAYS BICKERING IS THAT YOU'RE SO MUCH ALIKE ME LIKE HIM SURE
1988-24833-0012 AS LONG AS THERES A BONE ON THE FLOOR THE TWO OF YOU WORRY IT
1988-24833-0013 I LAY THE PILLOWS COMFORTABLY ARRANGED ON THE FLOOR WITH A BIG BOTTLE OF SODA AND A BAG OF POP CORN WITHIN EASY REACH
1988-24833-0014 PAP GOES RIGHT ON TUNING HIS CHANNEL
1988-24833-0015 YOU'RE GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO UPSET OVER THESE PROGRAMMES STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSELF
1988-24833-0016 IT'S YOUR FAULT MOP IT UP
1988-24833-0017 I HEAR THE TEVE GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POP TURNS IT OFF AND GOES IN THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO MOM
1988-24833-0018 WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURN A GUY'S TEABE PROGRAMME OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT
1988-24833-0019 AH LOOK AT MY WATCH IT'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
1988-24833-0020 I TURN OFF THE TELEVISION SET I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MY GRANDFATHER WHO'S A SPOOK AFTER ALL
1988-24833-0021 IT'S THE FIRST TIME HILDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AGAIN
1988-24833-0022 I TOLD TOM WE SHOULDN'T GO SO LATE SAYS HILDA
1988-24833-0023 TOM SAYS THINKS AND LOOKS AT HILDA AND SHE BLUSHES REALLY
1988-24833-0024 TOM DRINKS A LITTLE MORE COFFEE AND THEN HE GOES ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON THIS FLOWER SHOW JOB
1988-24833-0025 I KNOW I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANYWAY
1988-24833-0026 I'VE DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE COMPANY
1988-24833-0027 I'LL HAVE TO FACE SOME MORE SAYS TOM
1988-24833-0028 HERE'S TO YOU A MOST HAPPY LIFE
1993-147149-0000 HOW INFINITE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GARNERED IN THESE SAME TINY TREASURES HOUSES AND OH
1993-147149-0001 WHAT BANKRUPTS IN THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORSELESS CREDITOR SEIZES OF ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINS
1993-147149-0002 THE GHULLIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BAULKED OF ITS PREY
1993-147149-0003 THE BOARD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOKE CLAYPOLE HER HUSBAND'S BUCKINGHAMSHIRE PARISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENTS
1993-147149-0004 MARGARET MET JEM WILSON SEVERAL TIMES AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME
1993-147149-0005 SHE STOPT WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH OF THE WILSON'S DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN
1993-147149-0006 SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATHLIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAUSE BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DISTURB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALICE LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN WHICH SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BOARD PLACED UPON A SORT OF SOFA SETTEE IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM
1993-147149-0007 OVER THE CHILD WHICH YET BREATHED THE FATHER BENT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE SOME HOPE THERE WAS NONE
1993-147149-0008 IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE LITTLE ONE THINK YOU
1993-147149-0009 BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH INTO HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UP STAIRS AS IF AFRAID OF WAKENING HIM
1993-147149-0010 WISHING HIM SAID MARY IN A TONE OF INQUIRIES
1993-147149-0011 AGAIN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT
1993-147149-0012 HER CRIES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND UP TO TRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS
1993-147149-0013 MARY AND ALICE DREW NEAR THE FIRES AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME
1993-147149-0014 THEN ALICE BROKE THE SILENCE SAYING
1993-147149-0015 AFORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FOOL COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD AND ALL YOU'D HEARD HOW I'VE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME
1993-147149-0016 BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STURDY FRAME SHOOK WITH THE STRONG AGONY
1993-147149-0017 OH JEM DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO HEAR YOU
1993-147149-0018 HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THIS MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HAND'S TOUCH THRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR
1993-147149-0019 DON'T JEM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HER SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF
1993-147149-0020 MARY I ALMOST LOATHE MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER WERE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PAST AND GONE AND MARY AS SHE TRIED TO RELEASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLESSED
1993-147149-0021 HE REMAINED UPSTAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED AND QUIET STREETS TO TRY AND GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE HER WORK HOUR
1993-147149-0022 SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JEM AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOMS WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
1993-147149-0023 HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JEM'S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TALE THEY HAD TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY
1993-147149-0024 I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSSESSES ME AND I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE'S DOWNCAST AND THAT I MUST GO MEDDLING WITH HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNT'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM
1993-147149-0025 I THINK I CANNOT GO RIGHT FOR I EITHER CHECKED MYSELF TILL I'M DOWNRIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NAT'RAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF
1993-147149-0026 BUT WILL HE THANKE ME FOR IT
1993-147149-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREWDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UNWORLDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SIMMONDS YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF COMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES
1993-147149-0028 THE OLD LEAVEN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNT ESTHER FERMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE IDLE
1993-147149-0029 IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOLDED BY MISS SIMMONS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM A HASTY TEMPERED YET KIND DRESSMAKER
1993-147149-0030 BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE HOLIEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER POOR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DISHEARTENED GLOOMY PERSON
1993-147964-0000 THEY SAT ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS THOUGH IT WERE SUNDAY GREASING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLAITING WHIP LASHES
1993-147964-0001 ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSE TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIN
1993-147964-0002 I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YULKA AND ANTONIA AND YULKA WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW
1993-147964-0003 I CUT SQUARES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SEWED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK
1993-147964-0004 ON THE BRIGHT PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS AND ADVERTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
1993-147964-0005 WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SLUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDMOTHER A MEAN LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME
1993-147964-0006 I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET YOU
1993-147964-0007 HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREE FOR ME IN VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
1993-147964-0008 BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THIS SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE
1993-147964-0009 FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A SELECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLOURED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
1993-147964-0010 I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMPLIGHT JAKE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RUDELY MOLDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UNFINISHED OTTO WITH HIS HALF BEARD AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FEROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MOUSTACHE
1993-147965-0000 GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A BLUE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
1993-147965-0001 FOR MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
1993-147965-0002 WE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
1993-147965-0003 BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN ILL FROM CONSTANT USE
1993-147965-0004 ALL AFTERNOONS HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM
1993-147965-0005 AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER SHIMERDA WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE HAD KNOTTED
1993-147965-0006 HE STOOD STILL AND PASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
1993-147965-0007 HER FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN
1993-147965-0008 HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN A DARK
1993-147966-0000 THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A THAW AND BY NEW YEAR'S DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF DRY SLUSH AND THE GUTTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
1993-147966-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSES AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS AND CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE
1993-147966-0002 OUR MAMMA I SAID ANGRILY WANTS OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS
1993-147966-0003 I AMBROSCH MY MAMA COME HERE
1993-147966-0004 BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRAITS POVERTY MAY BRING OUT IN HIM
1993-147966-0005 THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BOISTEROUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME WALKING
1993-147966-0006 YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THIS TIME GRIM AND NO MISTAKE
2035-147960-0000 SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MOST OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROTECTING MANNER
2035-147960-0001 THAT CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD TOGETHER
2035-147960-0002 ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE SHIMERDAS I FOUND ANTONIA STARTING OUT ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AMBROSCH NEEDED
2035-147960-0003 THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS COLD AND HEADY AS WINE
2035-147960-0004 IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRAVEL BEDS THAT I FOUND MY ADVENTURE
2035-147960-0005 I WHIRLED AROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAVE EVER SEEN
2035-147960-0006 I THINK I'M JUST AWFUL JIM I WAS SO SCARED
2035-147960-0007 I NEVER KNOW YOU IS SO BRAVE JIM SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY
2035-147960-0008 A FAINT FETID SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THRILL OF GREEN LIQUID OOZED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD
2035-147960-0009 COME TONY THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID
2035-147960-0010 I EXPLAINED TO ANTONIA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MAN FIRST CAME LEFT ON THE BUFFALO AND INDIAN TIMES
2035-147960-0011 WE DECIDED THAT ANTONIA SHOULD RIDE DUDE ALONG AND I WOULD WALK
2035-147960-0012 I FOLLOWED WITH THAT SPADE OVER MY SHOULDER DRAGGING MY SNAKE
2035-147960-0013 OTTO FUCHS THE FIRST ONE WE MET
2035-147960-0014 HE COULD STAND RIGHT UP AND TALK TO YOU HE COULD DID HE FIGHT
2035-147960-0015 OTTO WINKED AT ME AND
2035-147960-0016 A SNAKE OF HIS SIZE AND FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOYS COULD HANDLE
2035-147961-0000 PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISSUS SHIMERDA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONUS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE A MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW
2035-147961-0001 PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF ITS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER
2035-147961-0002 SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE COME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOUGHNUTS FOR US
2035-147961-0003 WE SAT STILL AND DID NOT TALK
2035-147961-0004 THE LITTLE HOUSE IN THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOUR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
2035-147961-0005 THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING IN
2035-147961-0006 I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN AT THE BED
2035-147961-0007 THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS CAME THROUGH THE ROOM
2035-147961-0008 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HER FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE
2035-147961-0009 THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FISTS
2035-147961-0010 HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING THE PEOPLE WHO HAD WRONGED HIM
2035-147961-0011 QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY SPOT SO BRIGHT
2035-147961-0012 HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH THE CROUP
2035-147961-0013 ANTONIA'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LITTLE BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY
2035-147961-0014 FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW SHAPE HIS BODY WAS
2035-147961-0015 GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO BOTH OF US
2035-147961-0016 WITHOUT A WORDS PETER GOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN
2035-147961-0017 AND MISTER SHIMERDA WENT WITH HIM
2035-147961-0018 AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH A PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE
2035-147961-0019 THE FIRST HOWLS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND THE QUICKENING REPETITIONS
2035-147961-0020 A BLACK DROVE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BESIDE THE WEDDING PARTY
2035-147961-0021 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE HINDMOST SLEDGE THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL HE WAS PROBABLY VERY DRUNK THE HORSES LEFT THE ROAD AND SLEDGE WAS CAUGHT UP IN A CLUMP OF TREES AND OVERTURNED
2035-147961-0022 THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOW MADE EVERYBODY SOBER
2035-147961-0023 THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WILD AND THE GROOM'S THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND
2035-147961-0024 THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLAVES LEFT HE WHISPERED
2035-147961-0025 AND THE WOLVES POBBLE ASKED ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US
2035-147961-0026 THEY WAS WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILLAGE NOW
2035-147961-0027 YES HOW GOOD
2035-147961-0028 TWENTY THIRTY FIVE
2035-147961-0029 THEN HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO
2035-147961-0030 PAVEL KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLEDGE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER THEM
2035-147961-0031 PETER CROUCHING IN THAT FRONT SEAT SAW NOTHING
2035-147961-0032 THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO A CLEAN AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS
2035-147961-0033 THEY WERE THROWN OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE
2035-147961-0034 WHEREVER THEY WENT HER STORY FOLLOWED THEM
2035-147961-0035 THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MOINES FORT BLAIN BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE
2035-147961-0036 DURING THE AUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYE
2035-147961-0037 ANY ONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER
2035-147961-0038 THE LOSS OF THESE TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SHIMERDA
2035-147961-0039 WHEN HE WAS ABOUT HUNTING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EMPTY LOG HOUSE AND SIT THERE BROODING
2035-147961-0040 THIS CABIN WAS HIS HERMITAGE WHEN THE WINTER SNOWS PENNED HIM IN HIS CAVE
2035-152373-0000 THROUGHOUT THIS CENTURY THE POWER OF A CHURCH WAS CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND IS VISIBLE IN MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES
2035-152373-0001 THE ANCESTORS OF THE PRESENT PRETENDER CONGEL SURNAMED THE SQUINT EYED HAD TWICE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED THE LICENTIOUS BARDS WHEN UNDER THE BAN OF TARA AND HIS POPULARITY WITH THAT STILL POWERFUL ORDER WAS ONE PROP OF HIS AMBITION
2035-152373-0002 IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF DRUIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLAIN OF MOERA
2035-152373-0003 THE POETS OF SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE DWELT MUCH IN DETAIL ON THE OCCURRENCES OF HIS MEMORABLE DAY
2035-152373-0004 LIKE THE TWO KINGS OF SPARTA THEY REIGNED JOINTLY DIVIDING BETWEEN THEM THE LABOURING AND CARES OF STATE
2035-152373-0005 IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SUN GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNUAL OBLATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEARTS STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BELL MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE ECLIPSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION OF THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND THE OVERTHREW OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLAIN OF PROSTRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE
2035-152373-0006 LASTLY THE ROYAL BRETHREN FELL THEMSELVES VICTIMS TO THE EPIDEMIC WHICH SO SADLY SIGNALIZES THEIR REIGN
2035-152373-0007 THE ONLY CONFLICTS THAT OCCURRED ON IRISH SOIL WITH A PICTISH OR AN ANGLO SAXON FORCE IF WE ACCEPT THOSE WHO FORMED A CONTINGENT OF CONALL'S ARMY AT MOIRA OCCURRED IN THE TIME OF THE HOSPITABLE FINNECTA
2035-152373-0008 AS LEADING TO THE MENTION OF OTHER INTERESTING EVENTS I MUST SET THIS INROAD CLEARLY BEFORE THE READER

2035-152373-0010 THE VILLAGE OF NORTHUMBRIA AS THE NAME IMPLIES EMBRACED NEARLY ALL THE COUNTRY FROM THE HUMBER TO THE PICTISH BORDER
2035-152373-0011 THE BARREN ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND THEIR CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS
2035-152373-0012 NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FROM IONA HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY WAS FULLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL
2035-152373-0013 WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEATH THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONA WAS PITCHED ON THE RAFT OF TARA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE
2035-152373-0014 SO SLOW AND IMPATIENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITY INFUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A CONVERTED PEOPLE

2078-142845-0033 HE SAYS THAT BY CUTTING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE SLICES AT A TIME ALL THE BUTTER IS SQUEEZED OUT OF THE UPPER ONES WHILE THE BOTTOM ONE IS SWIMMING IN FAT
2078-142845-0034 MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS SHOULD ALWAYS BE SERVED ON SEPARATE DISHES AND EACH TOASTED AND SERVED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE

2086-149214-0000 A NARRATIVE IT MAY BE IS WOVEN OF SO HUMBLE A TEXTURE AS TO REQUIRE THIS ADVANTAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO RENDER IT THE MORE DIFFICULT OF ATTAINMENT
2086-149214-0001 IN GOOD FAITH HOWEVER IT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMAGINATIVE TO FLATTER HIMSELF WITH THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF THIS KIND
2086-149214-0002 THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED IT HARDLY WORTH HIS WHILE THEREFORE RELENTLESSLY TO IMPALE THE STORY WITH ITS MORAL AS WITH AN IRON ROD OR RATHER AS BY STICKING A PEN THROUGH A BUTTERFLY THUS AT ONCE DEPRIVING IT OF LIFE AND CAUSING IT TO STIFFEN IN UNGAINLY AND UNNATURAL ATTITUDE
2086-149214-0003 IF PERMITTED BY THE HISTORICAL CONNEXION WHICH THOUGH SLIGHT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS PLANS THE AUTHOR WOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE AVOIDED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE
2086-149214-0004 HE TRUSTS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS UNPARDONABLY OFFENDING BY LAYING OUT A STREET THAT INFRINGES UPON NOBODY'S PRIVATE RIGHTS AND APPROPRIATING A LOT OF LAND WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE OWNER AND BUILDING A HOUSE OF MATERIALS LONG IN USE FOR CONSTRUCTING CASTLES IN THE AIR
2086-149220-0000 THE ENCLOSURE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE BUT WAS NOW CONTRACTED INTO SMALL COMPASS AND HEMMED ABOUT PARTLY BY HIGH WOODEN FENCES AND PARTLY BY THE OUTBUILDINGS OF HOUSES THAT STOOD ON ANOTHER STREET
2086-149220-0001 THE WHITE DOUBLE ROSE BUSH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PROPPED UP ANEW AGAINST THE HOUSE SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SEASON AND A PEAR TREE AND THREE DAMON TREES WHICH EXCEPT A ROW OF CURRANT BUSHES CONSTITUTED THE ONLY VARIETIES OF FRUIT BORE MARKS OF THE RECENT AMPUTATION OF SEVERAL SUPERFLUOUS OR DEFECTIVE LIMBS
2086-149220-0002 THERE WERE ALSO A FEW SPECIES OF ANTIQUE AND HEREDITARY FLOWERS IN NO VERY FLOURISHING CONDITION BUT SCRUPULOUSLY WEEDED AS IF ANY PERSON EITHER OUT OF LOVE OR CURIOSITY HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO BRING THEM TO SUCH PERFECTION AS THEY WERE CAPABLE OF ATTAINING
2086-149220-0003 SUMMER SQUASHES ALMOST IN THEIR GOLDEN BLOSSOM CUCUMBERS NOW EVINCING A TENDENCY TO SPEND AWAY FROM THE MAIN STALK AND RAMBLE FAR AND WIDE TWO OR THREE ROWS OF STRING BEANS AND AS MANY MORE THAT WERE ABOUT TO FESTOON THEMSELVES ON POLES TOMATOES OCCUPYING A SITE SO SHELTERED AND SUNNY THAT THE PLANTS WERE ALREADY GIGANTIC AND PROMISED AN EARLY AND ABUNDANT HARVEST
2086-149220-0004 PHOEBE WONDERED WHOSE CARE AND TOIL IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT HAS PLANTED THESE VEGETABLES AND KEPT THE SOIL SO CLEAN AND ORDERLY
2086-149220-0005 BEES TOO STRANGE TO SAY HAD THOUGHT IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO COME HITHER POSSIBLY FROM THE RANGE OF HIVES BESIDES SOME FARMHOUSE MILES AWAY
2086-149220-0006 THIS WAS A FOUNTAIN SET ROUND WITH A RIM OF OLD MOSSY STONES AND PAVED ON ITS BED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SORT OF MOSAIC WORK OF VARIOUSLY COLORED PEBBLES
2086-149220-0007 IT NOW CONTAINED ONLY CHANTICLEER HIS TWO WIVES AND A SOLITARY KITCHEN
2086-149220-0008 IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE RACE HAD DEGENERATED LIKE MANY A NOBLE RACE BESIDES IN CONSEQUENCE OF TOO STRICT A WATCHFULNESS TO KEEP IT PURE
2086-149220-0009 THESE FEATHERED PEOPLE HAD EXISTED TOO LONG IN THEIR DISTINCT VARIETY A FACT OF WHICH THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVES JUDGING BY THEIR LUGUBRIOUS DEPORTMENT SEEMS TO BE AWARE
2086-149220-0010 THEY KEPT THEMSELVES ALIVE UNQUESTIONABLY AND LAID NOW AND THEN AN EGG AND HATCHED A CHICKEN NOT FOR ANY PLEASURE OF THEIR OWN BUT THAT THE WORLD MIGHT NOT ABSOLUTELY LOSE WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SO AMIABLE A BREED OF FOWLS
2086-149220-0011 THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF THE HENS WAS THE CREST OF LAMENTABLY SCANTY GROWTH IN THESE LATTER DAYS BUT SO ODDLY AND WICKEDLY ANALOGOUS TO HEPSABA'S TURBAN THAT PHOEBE TO THE POIGNANT DISTRESS OF HER CONSCIENCE BUT INEVITABLY WAS LED TO FANCY A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE BETWIXT THESE FORLORN BIPEDS AND HER RESPECTABLE RELATIVE
2086-149220-0012 THE CHICKEN CREPT THROUGH THE PAILS OF THE COOP AND RUN WITH SOME SHOW OF LIVELINESS TO HER FEET WHILE CHANTICLEER AND THE LADIES OF HIS HOUSEHOLD REGARDED HER WITH QUEER SIDELONG GLANCES AND THEN CROAKED ONE TO ANOTHER AS IF COMMUNICATING THEIR SAGE OPINIONS OF HER CHARACTER
2086-149220-0013 SO WISE AS WELL AS ANTIQUE WAS THEIR ASPECT AS TO GIVE COLOUR TO THE IDEA NOT MERELY THAT THEY WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF A TIME HONOURED RACE BUT THAT THEY HAD EXISTED IN THE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY EVER SINCE THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES WAS FOUNDED AND WERE SOMEHOW MIXED UP WITH ITS DESTINY
2086-149220-0014 HE HELD THE HOE IN HIS HAND AND WHILE PHOEBE WAS GONE IN QUEST OF THE CRUMBS HAD BEGUN TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH DRAWING UP FRESH EARTH ABOUT THE ROOTS OF THE TOMATOES
2086-149220-0015 THEY HAVE KNOWN ME MUCH LONGER BUT NEVER HONOR ME WITH ANY FAMILIARITY THO HARDLY A DAY PASSES WITHOUT MY BRINGING THEM FOOD

2086-149220-0018 I PREFER TO THINK AND SO WOULD MISS HEPSABBA THAT THEY RECOGNISE THE FAMILY TONE FOR YOU ARE A PENSION
2086-149220-0019 MY NAME IS PHOEBE PENSION SAID THE GIRL WITH A MANNER OF SOME RESERVE FOR SHE WAS AWARE THAT HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE DAGRAREOTYPIST OF WHOSE LAWLESS PROPENSITIES THE OLD MAID HAD GIVEN HER A DISAGREEABLE IDEA
2086-149220-0020 I RETURN UP THE EARTH BY A WAY OF PASTIME
2086-149220-0021 IT IS A BANDAGE OVER ONE'S EYES TO COME INTO IT
2086-149220-0022 IF YOU WOULD PERMIT ME SAID THE ARTIST LOOKING AT PHHOEBE I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY WHETHER THE DAGUERREOTYPE CAN BRING OUT DISAGREEABLE TRAITS ON A PERFECTLY AMIABLE FACE
2086-149220-0023 MOST OF MY LIKENESSES DO LOOK UNAMIABLE BUT THE VERY SUFFICIENT REASON I FANCY IS BECAUSE THEIR ORIGINALS ARE SO
2086-149220-0024 THERE IS A WONDERFUL INSIGHT IN HEAVEN'S BRIGHT AND SIMPLE SUNSHINE
2086-149220-0025 WHILE WE GIVE IT CREDIT ONLY FOR DEPICTING THE MEREST SURFACE IT ACTUALLY BRINGS OUT THE SECRET CHARACTER WITH A TRUTH THAT NO PAINTER WILL EVER VENTURE UPON EVEN COULD HE DETECT IT
2086-149220-0026 YET THE ORIGINAL WEARS TO COMMON LIFE A VERY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION
2086-149220-0027 HE EXHIBITED A DAGRAREOTYPED MINIATURE IN A MOROCCO CASE
2086-149220-0028 PHOEBE MERELY GLANCED AT IT AND TOOK IT BACK
2086-149220-0029 I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS A MODERN FACE AND ONE WHICH YOU WILL VERY PROBABLY READ
2086-149220-0030 THE SUN AS YOU THINK TELLS QUITE ANOTHER STORY AND WE'LL NOT BE COAXED OUT OF IT AFTER HALF A DOZEN PATIENT ATTEMPTS ON MY PART
2086-149220-0031 HERE WE HAVE THE MAN SLY SUBTLE HARD IMPERIOUS AND WITHAL COLD AS ICE LOOKED AT THAT EYE
2086-149220-0032 AND YES IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE THE BENIGN SMILE OF THE ORIGINAL
2086-149220-0033 WELL I DON'T WISH TO SEE IT ANY MORE OBSERVED PHOEBE TURNING AWAY HER EYES IT IS CERTAINLY VERY LIKE THE OLD PORCH
2086-149220-0034 IF THE ORIGINAL IS STILL IN THE WORLD I THINK HE MIGHT DEFY THE SON AND MAKE HIM LOOK STERN AND HARD
2086-149220-0035 IS THERE NOTHING WILD IN THAT EYE CONTINUED HOLGRAVE SO EARNESTLY THAT IT EMBARRASSED PHOEBE AS DID ALSO THE QUIET FREEDOM WITH WHICH HE PRESUMED ON THEIR SO RECENT ACQUAINTANCE
2086-149220-0036 IS NONSENSE SAID PHOEBE A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT A PICTURE WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
2086-149220-0037 SINCE YOU ARE A FRIEND OF MY COUSIN HEPSIA'S YOU SHOULD ASK HER TO SHOW YOU THE PICTURE
2086-149220-0038 SO WE WILL BE FELLOW LABOURERS SOMEWHAT ON A COMMUNITY SYSTEM
2086-149220-0039 AND SHE DID NOT ALTOGETHER LIKE HIM
2086-149220-0040 OH REJOINED THE DAGUERREOTYPISTS BECAUSE LIKE AN OLD LADY'S CUP OF TEA IT IS WATER BEWITCHED
2086-149220-0041 SHE WAS INDISTINCTLY AWARE HOWEVER THAT THE GAUNT FIGURE OF THE OLD GENTLEWOMAN WAS SITTING IN ONE OF THE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIRS A LITTLE WITHDRAWN FROM THE WINDOW THE FAINT GLEAM OF WHICH SHOWED THE BLANCHED PALENESS OF HER CHEEKS TURNED SIDEWAYS TOWARD THE CORNER
2086-149220-0042 BUT PUT IT ON THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF A PASSAGE
2086-149220-0043 WHAT AN INSTANT IS THE HUMAN VOICE
2086-149220-0044 HOW WONDERFULLY RESPONSIVE TO EVERY EMOTION OF HIS HUMAN SOUL
2086-149220-0045 FEWER WORDS THAN BEFORE BUT WITH THIS SAME MYSTERIOUS MUSIC IN THEM
2086-149220-0046 PRAY GO TO BED FOR I AM SURE YOU WOULD NEED REST
2086-149220-0047 I WOULD SIT IN THE PARLOUR A WHILE AND COLLECT MY THOUGHTS
2086-149220-0048 WHEN THUS DISMISSING HER THE MAIDEN LADY STEPPED FORWARD KISSED PHOEBE AND PRESSED HER TO HER HEART WHICH BEAT AGAINST THE GIRL'S BOSOM WITH A STRONG HIGH AND TUMULTUOUS SWELL
2086-149220-0049 AT SOME UNCERTAIN PERIOD IN THE DEPTHS OF NIGHT AND AS IT WERE THROUGH THE THIN VEIL OF A DREAM SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FOOTSTEP MOUNTING THE STAIRS HEAVILY BUT NOT WITH FORCE AND DESIGN
2277-149874-0000 WINNIE'S FLAT AS THE ONE FLOOR RESIDENT APARTMENTS WERE THEN BEING CALLED WAS IN A PART OF WEST VAN BUREN STREET INHABITED BY FAMILIES OF LABORERS AND CLERKS MEN WHO HAD COME AND WERE STILL COMING WITH THE RUSH OF POPULATION POURING IN AT THE RATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR
2277-149874-0001 TO CARRIE THE SOUND OF THE LITTLE BELLS OF THE HORSE CARS AS THEY TINKLED IN AND OUT OF HEARING WAS AS PLEASING AS IT WAS NOVEL
2277-149874-0002 TO HIM THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF MY WIFE'S SISTER WAS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
2277-149874-0003 HE WAS OF A CLEAN SAVING DISPOSITION AND HAD ALREADY PAID A NUMBER OF MONTHLY INSTALMENTS ON TWO LOTS FAR OUT ON THE WESTERN SIDE
2277-149874-0004 HIS AMBITION WAS SOME DAY TO BUILD A HOUSES ON THEM
2277-149874-0005 SHE HAD SOME SLIGHT GIFT OF OBSERVATION AND THIS SENSE SO RICH IN EVERY WOMAN INTUITION
2277-149874-0006 THE WALL OF THE ROOMS WERE DISCORDANTLY PAPERED
2277-149874-0007 THE FLOORS WERE COVERED WITH MATTING AND THE HALL LAID WITH A THIN CARPET
2277-149874-0008 THEN SHE LAUGHED AND SANG TO IT UNTIL HANSEN DISTURBED IN HIS READING CAME AND TOOK IT
2277-149874-0009 YOU COULD SEE THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN HIS OFFSPRING
2277-149874-0010 NOW NOW HE SAID LOOKING THERE THERE AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN SWEDISH ACCENT NOTICEABLE IN HIS VOICE
2277-149874-0011 IT SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE
2277-149874-0012 MINNIE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN BUT HER HUSBAND TOOK THIS PART IN THE CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF
2277-149874-0013 YOU SHOULD GET HOME EASY TOO IT ISN'T VERY FAR
2277-149874-0014 SHE ASKED MINNIE FOR INK AND PAPER THAT WERE UPON THE MANTEL IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD GONE TO BED AT TEN GOT OUT DROUET'S CARD AND WROTE HIM
2277-149874-0015 SHE WISHED TO MAKE SOME REFERENCE TO THEIR RELATIONS UPON THE TRAIN BUT WAS TOO TIMID
2277-149874-0016 ANYTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH SO LONG AS IT PAID YOU FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK TO BEGIN WITH
2277-149874-0017 A SHOP GIRL WAS HER DESTINY PREFIGURED FOR THE NEW COMER
2277-149874-0018 IT WAS UNDER SUCH AUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE STARTED OUT THAT MORNING TO LOOK FOR WORK
2277-149874-0019 NARROW BROAD WALKS EXTENDED OUT PASSING HERE A HOUSE AND THERE A STORE AT FAR INTERVALS EVENTUALLY ENDING ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE
2277-149874-0020 IT GAVE AN IMPOSING APPEARANCE TO BOTH OF THE WHOLESALE HOUSES WHOSE OFFICES WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR AND IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE STREET
2277-149874-0021 THEY VAST BUILDINGS WHAT WERE THEY
2277-149896-0000 HE WAS IN A FEVERING STATE OF MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFE'S ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE
2277-149896-0001 HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY HER THE MONEY WHICH SHE WOULD NOW REGULARLY DEMAND OR THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IT DO NOT MATTER WHAT HE DID
2277-149896-0002 HURSTWOOD WALKED THE FLOOR MENTALLY ARRANGING THE CHIEF POINTS OF HER SITUATION
2277-149896-0003 HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAGERIAL DISPOSITION
2277-149896-0004 WHAT WOULD THE PAPERS TALK ABOUT IT
2277-149896-0005 MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS WITH HIS BROW MOISTENED
2277-149896-0006 HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR HARRIE WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY
2277-149896-0007 HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER WE WERE GOING TO MEET AS USUAL
2277-149896-0008 FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANNED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS
2277-149896-0009 WHY THE DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALIZED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS
2277-149896-0010 SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DRUEL THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT
2277-149896-0011 SHE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RUMINATED AND THEN DECIDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING
2277-149896-0012 I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY THIS MORNING
2277-149896-0013 HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WILL LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE
2277-149896-0014 AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAITING AND DREARILY HEADED FOR THE MAD CAR
2277-149896-0015 HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS AND THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CARRIE
2277-149896-0016 FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOTHING TO HIS WIFE EITHER
2277-149896-0017 AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO REGER'S FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM
2277-149896-0018 HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOUR WORDS IN REPLY GO TO THAT DEVIL
2277-149896-0019 BUT HE COMPROMISED BY TELLING A BOY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY
2277-149896-0020 THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK
2277-149896-0021 WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THIS THE CONFOUNDED WRETCH
2277-149896-0022 LATER HOWEVER THEIR OLD DISCRETION ASSERTED ITSELF
2277-149896-0023 SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CLIMAX WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SIT
2277-149896-0024 HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDED UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW UP
2277-149896-0025 HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT IN THE STREET
2277-149896-0026 THE LONG DRIZZLE HAD BEGUN PEDESTRIANS HAD TURNED UP COLLARS AND TROUSERS IN THE BOTTOM
2277-149896-0027 HURSTWOOD ALMOST CRIED OUT LOUD AT THE INSISTENCY OF THIS THING
2277-149896-0028 HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED OVER FOR HIS UMBRELLA
2277-149896-0029 HE WOULD HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF THIS SORT
2277-149896-0030 HE BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THAT HE HAD SPENT THE MONEY PERHAPS HE COULD DO IT UP HERE
2277-149896-0031 HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANYHOW HE WOULD HAVE NO RAY
2277-149896-0032 BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER AND OVER THAT SOME SOLUTION WOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE MIGHT SEE HIS WAY OUT
2277-149896-0033 THEN HE RANG HIS BELL NO ANSWER
2277-149896-0034 AND HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL NO ANSWER
2277-149897-0000 WHEN HURSTWICK GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER
2277-149897-0001 HE COULD HARDLY REALIZE HOW IT HAS ALL COME ABOUT
2277-149897-0002 NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MOMENT
2277-149897-0003 HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS THEY HAD NOT FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE
2277-149897-0004 HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PANACEA FOR THE ILL WHICH VEXED HIM
2277-149897-0005 IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN ENVELOPE PLACED IN IT THE REQUESTED AMOUNT AND SLOWLY SEALED UP
2277-149897-0006 THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORKS AROUND THE PLACE
2277-149897-0007 YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE ENVELOPE AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD SIR SAID THE BOY
2277-149897-0008 ANOTHER ANSWER I GUESS NOT
2277-149897-0009 THE BOY HASTILY AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUSINGS
2277-149897-0010 HE HAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT
2277-149897-0011 SHE WOULD TAKE THE ENVELOPE AND THINK THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED
2277-149897-0012 IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T SEND
2277-149897-0013 OF RELIEF HE AROSE AND JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING
2277-149897-0014 ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN ON TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THEREIN ENACTED
2277-149897-0015 AND ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE BOY RETURNED
2277-149897-0016 HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANWHILE HE MIGHT HAVE TIME TO THINK
2277-149897-0017 WHAT ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR WRITE HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE SUBJECT
2277-149897-0018 HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER READ HIM
2277-149897-0019 THREE O'CLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO OTHER
2277-149897-0020 THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND PRIMLY ENDURED THE GLOOM OF DEFEAT
2277-149897-0021 HE SAW A BUSY SATURDAY USHERED OUT A SABBATH IN AND NOTHING DONE
2277-149897-0022 ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE BROODED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS PURSUIT FROM KERRY AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE IOTA
2277-149897-0023 IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAS SPENT IN HIS LIFE
2277-149897-0024 IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FELLOW TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING
2277-149897-0025 HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED WITH HIS PERFIDY
2277-149897-0026 HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE APPEARED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE
2277-149897-0027 HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL OF HIS FAMILY COMPLICATIONS
2277-149897-0028 IT WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STOOD AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER
2277-149897-0029 HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CARRIE BUT WHEN HE GOT INTO OGDEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY
2277-149897-0030 HE COULD NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE
2277-149897-0031 HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY
2277-149897-0032 HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCH MAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED
2277-149897-0033 UPON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMES AND HAY IT READ
2277-149897-0034 DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS AMELIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIVORCE AND ALIMONY
2277-149897-0035 VERY TRULY YOURS ET CETERA COMPROMIS
2277-149897-0036 SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAN BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
2277-149897-0037 IF THEY DIDN'T GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SUE HIM PROMPTLY
2412-153947-0000 PREFACE TO THEIR SECOND EDITION
2412-153947-0001 THIS IS A MISTAKE IF A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE
2412-153947-0002 ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REPRISES TO THE PRINTER
2412-153947-0003 THAN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER
2412-153947-0004 I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO THE ABSURDITY
2412-153947-0005 I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS DISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE
2412-153947-0006 BUT THAT HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFELONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
2412-153947-0007 I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS OR TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES
2412-153947-0008 IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RANGAUTADA DISTRICT OF THE CANTERBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRISTCHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPERS JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
2412-153947-0009 I ALSO WROTE ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FROM BEING IN A CONSUMPTION
2412-153947-0010 I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRUUBNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
2412-153947-0011 I ATTRIBUTE THIS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVORABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH
2412-153947-0012 THIS WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUSE
2412-153947-0013 THE FIRST EDITIONS OF EREWHON SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MOULDS AND AS THE DEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
2412-153947-0014 I MADE A FEW RATHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOLDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STEREOS THEN MADE
2412-153947-0015 I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EREWHON THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN AND FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD
2412-153947-0016 THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPYWRIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS
2412-153948-0000 IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WOULD SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF
2412-153948-0001 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY BE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE
2412-153948-0002 NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HONEST WILL DOUBT THEIR BEING SO
2412-153948-0003 I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH HEMISPHERE I WAS
2412-153948-0004 SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BRED WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF COUNTRY GOING INLAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN ACRE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RANGES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPOTTED OUT AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY
2412-153948-0005 I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND HIS MANNER OF LIFE
2412-153948-0006 I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO SEE THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING EWES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET
2412-153948-0007 THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEW AS TWO OR THREE BLACK EWES AND A BLACK LAMB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS THAT HAD SOME DISTINGUISHING MARK WHEREBY I COULD TELL THEM
2412-153948-0008 IT IS SURPRISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP TWO OR THREE HUNDRED
2412-153948-0009 IT WAS A MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND EVERYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL
2412-153948-0010 THE COUNTRY WAS THE GRANDEST WHICH CAN BE IMAGINED
2412-153948-0011 SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GRAY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAMB BLEATING UPON THE MOUNTAINSIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING
2412-153948-0012 EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR HOME AT NIGHTFALL
2412-153948-0013 I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BORROWED CATTLE AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE MAN
2412-153948-0014 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO CROSS IT
2412-153948-0015 I WOULD TRY THE NEARER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GET
2412-153954-0000 SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE THAT STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE
2412-153954-0001 MY GUARDS HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOR EYE THEM
2412-153954-0002 THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY PLAIN
2412-153954-0003 A VINE GREW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME
2412-153954-0004 EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF CHOLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGETATED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN HEIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEAKEST
2412-153954-0005 EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYE LIDS EYE LASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT
2412-153954-0006 THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS AND GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHT OF THEIR CONVERSION IN FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY
2412-153954-0007 EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMELY AND THE OLD GREEN HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN
2412-153954-0008 THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN AND BEAUTIFUL
2412-153954-0009 I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST OF EGYPTIAN GREEK AND ITALIAN
2412-153954-0010 THE GENTLEMEN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY
2412-153954-0011 I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE IN MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED
2412-153954-0012 THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WAS NOW GATHERING
2412-153954-0013 I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES OR ENORMOUS TAILS
2412-153954-0014 IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME TO A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER
2412-153954-0015 SUFFICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT LOVELY AND HANDSOME
2412-153954-0016 IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND COUGHED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SPITE OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPORT IT
2412-153954-0017 THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS CARELESSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
2412-153954-0018 THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TRUNK THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELT ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
2412-153954-0019 BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOT WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH
2412-153954-0020 YES THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR IRON RAILS
2412-153954-0021 WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHES
2412-153954-0022 THE DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THAT THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME
2412-153954-0023 THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING ME
2412-153954-0024 HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO RELENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KINDEST MANNER
2428-83699-0000 I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP IN MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTIONS OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FESTIVE SEASON
2428-83699-0001 THE FESTIVE YES
2428-83699-0002 THE REPLY WAS WRITTEN IN A SPRAWLING FEMININE HAND WHICH WAS A LITTLE VAGUE
2428-83699-0003 IT APPEARED THAT THE TERMS COULD BE FIVE GUINEAS BUT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT FEE WOULD COVER
2428-83699-0004 THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE AWFUL
2428-83699-0005 THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMMODATIONS WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT
2428-83699-0006 THEN IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY PREDILECTION FOR THE NAME MADGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY
2428-83699-0007 I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MADGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE
2428-83699-0008 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE LIVELY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MADGE AND IT WAS THE ACCIDENT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHICH DECIDED HER TO GO
2428-83699-0009 I HAD SOME ALLUSIONS
2428-83699-0010 I SHOULD NOT EXPECT A PRINCELY ENTERTAINMENT
2428-83699-0011 ALL NIGHT THEY HAD BEEN BLOWING AND RAINING
2428-83699-0012 I FELT QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MOVED WITH THE CHRISTMAS CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS
2428-83699-0013 I EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MADGE I MEAN MISSUS JONES
2428-83699-0014 THIS WAS A HORRIBLE JOURNEY
2428-83699-0015 THAT HE WAS IMPERVIOUS TO REASON
2428-83699-0016 IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE PHYSICALS HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF
2428-83699-0017 WHEN AT LAST I REACHED CROFTON ON MY JOURNEY'S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE STATION STAFF CONSISTED OF A HALF WITTED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STATION MASTER PORTER AND CLERK COMBINED AND A HULKING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THERE WAS TO DO
2428-83699-0018 NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND HANGAR DEAN THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOWED FIELDS MY INFORMANT DID NOT MENTION
2428-83699-0019 THERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BUOYIN BLUNDERBUSS BUT THAT REQUIRED FETCHING
2428-83699-0020 WHEN THE TRAP DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UNCOMMONLY LIKE AN OLD SPRING CART
2428-83699-0021 OF IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH MY LUGGAGE
2428-83699-0022 I DID NOT KNOW WHAT I MEANT
2428-83699-0023 I DID NOT HEAR I WAS BEYOND IT
2428-83699-0024 I AM CHILLED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY
2428-83699-0025 I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTURING IN QUEST OF HIM
2428-83699-0026 HERE WILL BE THAT MIGHT BE SO
2428-83699-0027 THERE IS THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YE GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND EM
2428-83699-0028 THERE'S A KNOCKER IF NONE OF EM HAVEN'T TWISTED IT OUT
2428-83699-0029 THERE APPEARED TO BE NO KNOCKER THOUGH WHETHER IT HAD BEEN TWISTED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SEE
2428-83699-0030 NO ANSWER THOUGH I LOST A MORE THAN DECENT INTERVAL
2428-83699-0031 BETTER RINGING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD
2428-83699-0032 MAYBE THEY'RE UP TO SOME OF THEM GAMES AND WANTS ROUSING
2428-83699-0033 THE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT SEEMED LIKE EMPTY HOUSE
2428-83699-0034 PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PAIRS IT SEEMS AND A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
2428-83699-0035 A VOICE CRIED WHO'S THERE
2428-83699-0036 THE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMMONLY LIKE THE CHORUS OF LAUGHTER
2428-83699-0037 THERE WAS A RUSH OF ENTREATING FEET AN EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
2428-83699-0038 WHO LIVES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE GLAD
2428-83699-0039 I TOLLS THE BELL AGAIN
2428-83699-0040 AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASTENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A WOMAN WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND
2428-83699-0041 I'RE MISTER CHRISTOPHER FROM LONDON
2428-83699-0042 WE'VE LOST THE KEYS OF THE CELLAR AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE FOR THAT
2428-83705-0000 THEIR FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST
2428-83705-0001 BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLING
2428-83705-0002 I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARIANNE'S THINGS HAVE BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM WORKED
2428-83705-0003 IT IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL
2428-83705-0004 IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE'S WEDDING SO UNIMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I HAVE SET TO PLAY IN IT
2428-83705-0005 FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT HIS BEHAVIOR IN THE MATTER OF THE RING
2428-83705-0006 THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED ON THIS SUNDAY EVENING
2428-83705-0007 THE GIRL IS FRETTING BUT YOU DONT SEEM TO NOTICE IT
2428-83705-0008 I ASKED POSITIVELY GASPED
2428-83705-0009 THAT'S IT IN YOUR ACCOUNT
2428-83705-0010 FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHO IS IN THE LINE
2428-83705-0011 I NEVER SAW A PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS OR POSSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINES
2428-83705-0012 I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BECAUSE THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARIANNE'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT
2428-83705-0013 IT IS FOR HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPICION SPRINGS
2428-83705-0014 THAT SHE OWNS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIG STY FOR ALL I KNOW
2428-83705-0015 WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARIANNE SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONEYMOON IN HER COTTAGE OR PIGSTIE AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
2428-83705-0016 THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER BLOW OF LANGUAGE
2428-83705-0017 I FELT THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS
2428-83705-0018 IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAS A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
2428-83705-0019 AND OF COURSE I HAD MY INVITATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS
2428-83705-0020 IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE THE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT
2428-83705-0021 I SHALL MAKE PAPA GIVE ME FIVE POUNDS AT LEAST
2428-83705-0022 A BIRD IN THE HANDS IS WORTH TWO IN A BUSH AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US
2428-83705-0023 I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE SHE GIVES IT
2428-83705-0024 AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE WAS NO SHIRKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER
2428-83705-0025 I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DIDN'T GET IT
2428-83705-0026 OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THE KIND OF THING
2428-83705-0027 HERS WAS BEEN PRODIGIOUS
2428-83705-0028 SHE HAS A KNACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS VERY LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS
2428-83705-0029 I NOTICE THAT THESE ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS
2428-83705-0030 THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARIANNE A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL HIM WITH A FEELING OF RANCOROUS ACIDITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE
2428-83705-0031 SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF NATURE
2428-83705-0032 BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALSO FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
2428-83705-0033 WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARYON PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WHITING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO
2428-83705-0034 THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MCPHERSON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY
2428-83705-0035 AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MAC PHERSON HAS MARY ANN GIVEN YOU HER LOVE
2428-83705-0036 ALL ONE SNIGGERED
2428-83705-0037 I CANNOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY ON WHICH THE SNELLINGS MOVE
2428-83705-0038 AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RENDING WOULD BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
2428-83705-0039 P S THE CARDS ARE ALL FOR THE WEDDING
2428-83705-0040 WE'RE GOING FOR A HONEYMOON TO ITALY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
2428-83705-0041 A SECOND COUSIN OF MARIANNE'S IS IN A COOK'S TOURS LINE
2428-83705-0042 HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR JOURNEY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COUPONS FOR FREE BOARD AND LODGING AT THE HOTEL HERE'S A WEDDING PRESENT
2428-83705-0043 BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE COUPONS OR RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE DON'T USE
251-118436-0000 HE WAS YOUNG NO SPEARS HAD TOUCHED HIM NO POISON LURKED IN HIS WINE
251-118436-0001 I TELL YOU IT IS NOT POISONED SHE CRIED
251-118436-0002 SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVEREST POISONERS OF THE EAST COULD REACH HIM
251-118436-0003 AS YOU WELL KNOW THERE ARE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOLE DUTY WAS TO TASTE HIS FOOD AND WINE AND FIFTY ARMED WARRIORS GUARD HIS CHAMBER AS THEY GUARD IT NOW
251-118436-0004 A LOW CONFUSED MOAN WANED FROM THIS MOUTH
251-118436-0005 THE MAN SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND TURNED BACK INTO THE ARABESQUE ROOM
251-118436-0006 THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CAMEL HAIR ROBE AND SANDALS AND A GRAY TURBAN WAS ON HIS HEAD
251-118436-0007 NOT UNTIL THE HEAVENS WERE IN THE PROPER ORDER COULD THEY PERFORM THAT NECROMANCY
251-118436-0008 WITH A LONG STAINED FINGERNAIL HE MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS ON THE MARBLE TILED FLOOR
251-118436-0009 THE SLANT OF THE MOONLIGHT PRESAGED EVIL FOR THE KING OF VENDYA THE STARS ARE IN TURMOIL THE SERPENT IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELEPHANT
251-118436-0010 POINT OF CONTACT REQUIRED THE OTHER
251-118436-0011 ALL DISCARDING PORTIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY STILL REMAIN PART OF IT ATTACHED TO IT BY INTANGIBLE CONNECTIONS
251-118436-0012 BUT AT THE URGENT ENTREATY OF THE PRINCESS OF KOSALA WHO LOVED BUNDAH CHAND VAINLY HE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE
251-118436-0013 BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAWN FROM ITS BODY AND ACROSS GULFS OF ECHOING SPACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE HAT
251-118436-0014 ON THE DAIS UNDER THE GOLDEN DOME THE KING CRIES OUT AGAIN RACKED BY AWFUL PAROXYSMS
251-118436-0015 THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER CORD WHICH BINDS ME TO MY DYING BODY
251-118436-0016 THEY CLUSTER AROUND ME THEIR HANDS ARE TALONED THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE A FLAME BURNING IN DARKNESS
251-118436-0017 HIS FINGERS SEAR ME LIKE FIRE
251-118436-0018 I KNOW NOW WHAT BRINGS YOU TO THE PYRE
251-118436-0019 THERE THEY STROVE TO BREAK THE SILVER CHORD OF LIFE AND THRUST MY SOUL INTO THE BODY OF A FOUL NIGHT WEIRD THE SORCERY SUMMONED UP FROM HELL AH
251-118436-0020 YOUR CRY AND THE GRIP OF YOUR FINGERS PUT ME BACK BUT I AM GOING FAST
251-118436-0021 THERE WAS THE OLD IMPERIOUS NOTE IN HIS APPEALING WHISPER
251-118436-0022 YOU WHO HAVE NEVER DISOBEYED ME OBEY MY LAST COMMAND
251-118436-0023 SEND MY SOUL CLEAN TO ALSURA
251-136532-0000 THEY ALSO FOUND A MODERN CALENDAR THE YEAR HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO TEN MORE OR LESS EQUAL MONTHS AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DOMA
251-136532-0001 BILL CHANDLER THE ZOOLOGIST HAD BEEN GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD SEA BOTTOM OF CERTUS
251-136532-0002 THAT TOOK THE CENTER OF INTEREST AWAY FROM ARCHAEOLOGY AND STARTED THE NEW BURST OF ACTIVITY
251-136532-0003 THE CIVILIAN SPECIALISTS IN OTHER FIELD AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TAPE LINES AND MAKING SKETCHES AND SNAPPING CAMERAS WERE ALL FLYING TO LOWER CYRTUS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OXYGEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT SUPPORTED
251-136532-0004 THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOOSELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLASSED AS A REPTILE AND A CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIRDLIKE CLAWS AND A HERBIVOIR ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE PIG LIKE THING IN THE BIG DORLF HULVA MURAL AND ANOTHER LIKE A GAZELLE WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD
251-136532-0005 THE DAILY NEWSCASTS FROM TERRA SHOWED A CORRESPONDING SHIFT IN INTERESTS AT HOME
251-136532-0006 TONY'S FOUND THE MARS
251-136532-0007 IT WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE AND THEY HAD TO BURN IT DOWN WITH THE TORCH THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE
251-136532-0008 GLORIA STANDISH WHO HAD DROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE MEZZARINE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADIOPHONE EXTENSION DOZEN AND A HALF OF THEM
251-136532-0009 WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE DEAD WAS A QUESTION
251-136532-0010 MARTHA REMEMBERED THE CLOSED DOOR ON THE FIRST SURVEY HADN'T ATTEMPTED OPENING IT
251-136532-0011 NOW IT WAS BURNED AWAY AT BOTH SIDES AND LAY STILL FLAT ALONG THE EDGES ON THE FLOOR OF THE BIG OFFICE ROOM IN FRONT
251-136532-0012 A FLOOD LIGHT WAS ON IN THE ROOM INSIDE AND LATIMER WAS GOING AROUND LOOKING AT THINGS WHILE A SPACEFORCE OFFICER STOOD BY THE DOOR
251-136532-0013 MASS THE SUICIDE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS NOTICE WHAT'S IN THE CORNERS
251-136532-0014 PERHAPS CHARCOAL
251-136532-0015 SO THEY JUST CAME IN HERE AND LIT THE CHARCOAL AND SAT DRINKING TOGETHER TILL ALL FELL ASLEEP
251-136532-0016 THE TERRAN PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF LIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND A ROOMFUL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST
251-136532-0017 TONY LATIMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATIONS WITH SYD HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECASTE OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET
251-136532-0018 WITHOUT QUESTIONS HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORY
251-136532-0019 NOT THAT I'M INTERESTED IN ALL THIS FOR MYSELF HE DISCLAIMED AFTER LISTENING TO THE TELECASTE FROM TARA TWO DAYS AFTER HIS DISCOVERY
251-136532-0020 BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION DRAMATIZES IT
251-136532-0021 SO I HOPE I SHALL GO BACK AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO
251-136532-0022 LECTURE'S
251-136532-0023 THE ORGANIZATION OF A SOCIETY OF MARTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY WAS ANTHONY LATIMER P H D THE LOGICAL CANDIDATE FOR THE CHAIR
251-137823-0000 I'LL BE GLAD TO TRY SIR HE ANSWERED
251-137823-0001 INSIDE A SECRET ROCKET TELEMETERING DEVICE WAS MOUNTED ON ITS TEST
251-137823-0002 THIS ISN'T PART OF HER TESTING ROUTINE IS IT
251-137823-0003 ANOTHER ENGINEER RUSHED TOWARD THE DOOR TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING
251-137823-0004 ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT CASCADED FROM THE WHEEL SHELVES AND A HEAVY DUTY CHAIN HOIST CAME LOOSE FROM ITS OVERHEAD TRACK PLUNGING TO THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIFYING CRASH
251-137823-0005 AN INSTANT LATER IT CRASHED OVER PINNING MARK FABRE BESIDE IT
251-137823-0006 BUD THREW UP HIS ARMS TO PROTECTION HIMSELF BUT TOO LATE
251-137823-0007 FOR MINUTES NO ONE STIRRED ABOVE THE WRECKAGE
251-137823-0008 THEN SAM WHO HAD BEEN STUNNED BY SOME FALLING DEBRIS RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSITION
251-137823-0009 TOM'S EYES FOCUSSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY LITTLE BILLOWING DUST
251-137823-0010 THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SEVERAL GAPING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SAGGING DANGEROUSLY OF ITS SUPPORTING TRUSSES
251-137823-0011 THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAS JUST NOTICED HIS FRIEND LYING PINNED BENEATH A HEAVY BEAM NEAR BY
251-137823-0012 HIS FRIEND'S EYELIDS GLITTERED
251-137823-0013 WE'D BETTER NOT TRY TO MOVE HIM PAUL DECIDED WE'LL GET AN AMBULANCE
251-137823-0014 THEY PICKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WRECKAGE AND EMERGED ON A SCENE OF FRIGHTENED DESTRUCTION
251-137823-0015 LET'S SEE ABOUT GETTING HELP MISTER FABER
251-137823-0016 THEN THE ONLY TRUCK WE HAD AVAILABLE WAS IN THAT BURNING SHED THE SUPERINTENDENT ADDED BITTERLY
251-137823-0017 NOW WE WANT TO HELP GOT A JOB FOR US
251-137823-0018 WITHIN MINUTES TOM WAS IN CHARGE OF CLEARING AWAY RUMBLE AND EXTRICATING ANY ONE WHO MIGHT BE TRAPPED INSIDE THE BUILDINGS
251-137823-0019 THE TELEPHONE LINE WAS SOON REPAIRED AND A STEADY STREAM OF RESCUE VEHICLES BEGAN ARRIVING FROM HARKNESS FIRE TUCKS THREE AMBULANCES AND PRIVATE CARS DRIVEN BY VOLUNTEERS
251-137823-0020 THE THREE GIRLS WERE AS MUCH UPSET AS TOM'S MOTHER TOM LAUGHED
251-137823-0021 MISTER SWIFT CAME INTO THE LIVING ROOM JUST THEN AND TOLD TOM HOW WORRIED MISS SWIFT AND SANDY HAD BEEN
251-137823-0022 HE SMILED GUILTILY AS HE ADDED BUT I MUST ADMIT I WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE CONSCIOUS MYSELF
251-137823-0023 AND HE'S A GREAT SCIENTIST
251-137823-0024 TOM LAUGHED UNHAPPILY
251-137823-0025 MALE OR FEMALE HUMAN OR ANIMAL ANIMAL
251-137823-0026 AND MISTER SWIFT'S EYES TWINKLED
2803-154320-0000 FORTUNATELY WILL HALLEY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE OPPRESSIVE CANVAS OR HIS MASTS WOULD INEVITABLY COME DOWN
2803-154320-0001 MISTER MANGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HULL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FROM THE DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG
2803-154320-0002 THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE ME
2803-154320-0003 THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRESSED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED
2803-154320-0004 MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN THIS DISSERTATION ON THE PAMPAS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS
2803-154320-0005 ITS EYES WANDERED CEASELESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORIZON
2803-154320-0006 WHAT THEN MY LORDS
2803-154320-0007 GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHNNY
2803-154320-0008 SHE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JOHN
2803-154320-0009 YES MY LAD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN
2803-154320-0010 SHE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT
2803-154320-0011 THINK OF LADY GLENARVAN THINK OF MARY COUNT
2803-154320-0012 WILL HALLEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN
2803-154320-0013 SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS NO DANGER
2803-154320-0014 BUT AS FOR GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNCAN GOD FORBID
2803-154328-0000 THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAHITI RANGES WERE LIT FOR THE FIRST FIRES OF THE DAY
2803-154328-0001 HE HAD ONE NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH
2803-154328-0002 THE WHEEL ENDED
2803-154328-0003 SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ABEYANCE SOON WEIGHED ON THEIR EYELIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WATCHING
2803-154328-0004 IF IT IS DECREED THAT WE DIE TO NIGHT LET US DIE BRAVELY LIKE CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERROR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE
2803-154328-0005 GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT THEY HAD A NOBLE END IN VIEW
2803-154328-0006 GLENARVAN'S VOICE FIRMER TILL NOW FALTERED
2803-154328-0007 JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISED MARY WHAT I PROMISED YOU HELENA WHAT IS YOUR PLAN
2803-154328-0008 I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FULFILL THIS PROMISE
2803-154328-0009 MY LORD WHICHEVER OF US SURVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFILL THE WISH OF LADY HELENA AND HARRY GRANT
2803-154328-0010 AT LAST THE MAGISTRATE SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST MOMENT
2803-154328-0011 THAT JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS GUARDED
2803-154328-0012 ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS CUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK
2803-154328-0013 LISTEN SAID HE MOTIONING EM TO STOOP
2803-154328-0014 ANIMAL OR MAN SAID THE MAJOR I WILL SOON FIND OUT
2803-154328-0015 WILSON AND OLBANET JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS AND ALL UNITED TO DIG THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAGGER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WITH THEIR NAILS WHILE MULRADIE STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NATIVE GUARD THROUGH A CREVICE OF THE MATTING
2803-154328-0016 THAT COULD BE THE OBJECT
2803-154328-0017 DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS AND WAS IT SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LED TO THE UNDERTAKING
2803-154328-0018 THEIR FINGERS BLED BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASED SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY THE THIN LAYER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION
2803-154328-0019 JOHN MANGLES INSERTING THE BLADE OF THE PONIARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PROTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WIELDED IT
2803-154328-0020 BUT SOFTLY AS A NAME WAS BREATHED MARY GRANT ALREADY WAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARD GLENARVAN AND SEIZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES
2803-154328-0021 WATCH THE SAVAGES OUTSIDE SAID ROBIN
2803-154328-0022 ROUND HIS BODY WAS THROWN A LONG COIL OF FLAX ROPE
2803-154328-0023 MY CHILD MY CHILD MURMURED LADY HELENA THE SAVAGES COULD NOT KILL YOU
2803-161169-0000 ONCE THERE WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING TO IT EVERYTHING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
2803-161169-0001 THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATING THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OF FOUNTAINS WITH THEIR SONGS
2803-161169-0002 WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COLOURING
2803-161169-0003 AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARNED AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THIS STOREHOUSE
2803-161169-0004 THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPES DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOKS BLACK AND NARROW BEFORE US
2803-161169-0005 WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOTPATHS NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE LITTLE CARS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES
2803-161169-0006 LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHEN OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE
2803-161169-0007 SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LYING ASLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STROWNED AMONG THEM
2803-161169-0008 HERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ROUNDED LIKE A NUTSHELL YOU CAN SPLIT OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE NUT LYING SNUGLY AS DOES ANY CHESTNUT IN ITS BIRTH
2803-161169-0009 FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THAT HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES
2803-161169-0010 FOR WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPENED FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL
2803-161169-0011 WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAS KEPT ON BURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY
2803-161169-0012 THESE FORESTS WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WE HAVE NOW GREAT FERNS AS TALL AS THEIR HOUSE AND MOSSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PALM LEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE
2803-161169-0013 THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON THE TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND
2803-161169-0014 BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MADE A GAS FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANY THING FOR HARM ONLY
2803-161169-0015 IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS TAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT
2803-161169-0016 DON'T YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS REFED COAL TAR
2803-161169-0017 AND YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUGH FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLYCERIN TO HEAL THEM
2902-9006-0000 ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN ERA LABOURS UNDER THE TROUBLESOME DISADVANTAGE
2902-9006-0001 IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT DISADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HEINOUS WERE STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THE SINS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH SHE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY TO STATE THE CHURCH'S CASE FAR MORE WEAKLY THAN THE FACTS DESERVE
2902-9006-0002 NOT BE IT EVER REMEMBER THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF IMMORALITY ATTACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSOPHERS OF HER SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES
2902-9006-0003 THAT DIVINE WORD WHO IS THE LIGHT WHO LIGHTETH EVERY MAN WHICH COMETH IN THE WORLD HAD AWAKENED IN THE HEART OF MANKIND A MORAL CRAVING NEVER BEFORE FELT IN ANY STRENGTH EXCEPT BY A FEW ISOLATED PHILOSOPHERS OR PROPHETS
2902-9006-0004 THEIR VERY EMPERORS HAD ARRAYED THEMSELVES ON HER SIDE
2902-9006-0005 JULIAN'S LAST ATTEMPT TO RESTORE PAGANISM BY IMPERIAL INFLUENCE HAD ONLY PROVED THAT THE OLD FAITH HAD LOST ALL HOLD UPON THE HEARTS OF THE MASSES AT HIS DEATH THE GREAT TIDE WAVE OF NEW OPINION ROLLED ON UNCHECKED AND THE RULERS OF EARTH WERE FAIN TO SWIM WITH THE STREAM TO ACCEPT IN WORDS AT LEAST THE CHURCH'S LAWS AND THEIRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A KING OF KINGS TO WHOM EVEN THEY OWED HOMAGE AND OBEDIENCE AND TO CALL THEIR OWN SLAVES THEIR POORER BRETHREN AND OFTEN TOO THEIR SPIRITUAL SUPERIORS
2902-9006-0006 BUT IF THE EMPERORS HAD BECOME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAS NOT
2902-9006-0007 IN THE MEANTIME THE MINDS OF MEN CUT ADRIFT FROM THEIR ANCIENT MOORINGS WANDER WILDLY OVER PATHLESS SEAS OF SPECULATIVE DOUBT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE METAPHYSICAL AND CONTEMPLATIVE EAST ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE FOR THEMSELVES THE QUESTIONS OF MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNSEEN BY THOSE THOUSAND SCHISMS HERESIES AND THEOSOPHIES IT IS A DISGRACE TO THE WORD PHILOSOPHY TO CALL THEM BY IT ON THE RECORDS OF WHICH THE STUDENT NOW GAZES BEWILDERED UNABLE ALIKE TO COUNT OR TO EXPLAIN THEIR PHANTASIES
2902-9006-0008 THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCHMEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS WHICH MIGHT BE SOLVED UNLESS THE CHURCH WAS TO RELINQUISH FOREVER HER CLAIMS AS THE GREAT TEACHER AND SATISFIER OF THE HUMAN SOUL
2902-9006-0009 BUT THE HEALTH OF A CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE CREED WHICH IT PROFESSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF A FEW GREAT ECCLESIASTICS BUT ON THE FAITH AND VIRTUES OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS
2902-9006-0010 THE MAN'S SANNA MUST HAVE A CORPUS SANSUM TO INHABIT
2902-9006-0011 AND THE NEW BLOOD IN THE ERA OF THIS STORY WAS AT HAND
2902-9006-0012 TRIBE AFTER TRIBE WAS CROWDING ON TO THE ALPS AND TRAMPLING UPON EACH OTHER ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE
2902-9006-0013 THE HUNS SINGLY THEIR INFERIORS PRESSED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS ITALY WITH HER RICH CITIES AND FERTILE LOWLANDS BECKONED THEM ON TO PLUNDER AS AUXILIARIES THEY HAD LEARNED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND A ROMAN WEAKNESS AS CASUS BELLI WAS SOON FOUND
2902-9006-0014 HOW INIQUITOUS WAS THE CONDUCT OF THE SONS OF THEODOSIUS IN REFUSING THE USUAL BOUNTY BY WHICH THE GOTHS WERE BRIBED NOT TO ATTACK THE EMPIRE THE WHOLE PENT UP DELUGE BURST OVER THE PLAINS OF ITALY AND THE WESTERN EMPIRE BECAME FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE DYING IDIOT WHILE THE NEW INVADERS DIVIDED EUROPE AMONG THEMSELVES
2902-9006-0015 THE COUNTLESS TREASURES WHICH FIVE CENTURIES OF RAPINE HAD ACCUMULATED ROUND THE CAPITAL HAD BECOME THE PREY OF MEN CLOTHED IN SHEEPSKINS AND HORSEHIDE AND THE SISTER OF AN EMPEROR HAD FOUND HER BEAUTY VIRTUE AND PRIDE OF RACE WORTHILY MATCHED BY THOSE OF THE HARD HANDED NORTHERN HERO WHO LED HER AWAY FROM ITALY AS HIS CAPTIVE AND HIS BRIDE TO FOUND NEW KINGDOMS IN SOUTH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND TO DRIVE THE NEWLY ARRIVED VANDALS ACROSS THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR INTO THE THEN BLOOMING COAST LAND OF NORTHERN AFRICA
2902-9006-0016 THAT EXTRAORDINARY REFORM IN MORALS WHICH ACCORDING TO SALVATION AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES THE VANDAL CONQUERORS WORKED IN NORTH AFRICA AVAILED THEM NOTHING THEY LOST MORE THAN THEY GAVE
2902-9006-0017 CLIMATE BAD EXAMPLE AND THE LUXURY OF POWER DEGRADED THEM IN ONE CENTURY INTO A RACE OF HELPLESS AND DEBAUCHED SLAVE HOLDERS DOOMED TO UTTER EXTERMINATION BEFORE THE SEMI GOTHIC ARMIES OF BELISARIUS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE LAST CHANCE THAT THE GOTHIC RACES WOULD EXERCISE ON THE EASTERN WORLD THE SAME STERN YET WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH THE WESTERN HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO LIFE
2902-9006-0018 THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSIC SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN UNMEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT THAT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOMO EUOSEUS AND HOMOEUSIUS MIGHT HANG THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET TO BATTLE IN ALEXANDRIA THE ANCIENT STRONGHOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THE EFFICAT REMAINS OF THE VERY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED ITS EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE
2902-9006-0019 TO SIONYSIUS'S MOST CHARMING LETTERS AS WELL AS TO THOSE OF ISIDORE THE GOOD ABBOT OF PELLUSIUM I BEG LEAVE TO REFER THOSE READERS WHO WISH FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE FIFTH CENTURY
2902-9006-0020 I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THESE PAGES WILL BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM ANACHRONISMS AND ERRORS
2902-9008-0000 THE PLACE SEEMED FRAGRANT WITH ALL THE RICHES OF GREEK THOUGHT AND SONG SINCE THE DAYS WHEN PTOLEMY PHILODOLPHUS WALKED THERE WITH EUCLID AND THEOCRITUS CATOMMACHUS AND LYCOPHRON
2902-9008-0001 THE ROOM HAD NEITHER CARPET NOR FIREPLACE AND THE ONLY MOVABLES IN IT WERE A SOFA BED A TABLE AND AN ARM CHAIR ALL OF SUCH DELICATE AND GRACEFUL FORMS AS MAY BE SEEN ON ANCIENT VASES OF A FAR EARLIER PERIOD THAN THAT WHEREOF WE READ
2902-9008-0002 BUT MOST PROBABLY HAD ANY OF US ENTERED THE ROOM THAT MORNING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPARE A LOOK EITHER FOR THE FURNITURE OR THE GENERAL EFFECT OR THE MUSEUM GARDENS OR THE SPARKLING MEDITERRANEAN BEYOND BUT WE SHOULD HAVE AGREED THAT THE ROOM WAS QUITE RICH ENOUGH FOR HUMAN EYES FOR THE SAKE OF ONE TREASURE WHICH IT POSSESSED AND BESIDES WHICH NOTHING WAS WORTH A MOMENT'S GLANCE
2902-9008-0003 SHE HAS LIFTED HER EYES OFF HER MANUSCRIPT SHE IS LOOKING OUT WITH KINDLING COUNTENANCE OVER THE GARDENS OF THE MUSEUM HER RIPE CURLING GREEK LIPS SUCH AS WE NEVER SEE NOW EVEN AMONG OUR OWN WIVES AND SISTERS OPEN
2902-9008-0004 IF THEY HAVE CEASED TO GUIDE NATIONS THEY HAVE NOT CEASED TO SPEAK OF THEIR OWN ELECT
2902-9008-0005 IF THEY HAVE CAST OFF THE PUBLIC HERD THEY HAVE NOT CAST OFF HYPATIA
2902-9008-0006 TO BE WELCOMED INTO THE CELESTIAL RANKS OF THE HEROES TO RISE TO THE IMMORTAL GODS TO THE INEFFABLE POWERS ONWARD UPWARD EVER THROUGH AGES AND THROUGH ETERNITIES TILL I FIND MY HOME AT LAST AND VANISH IN THE GLORY OF THE NAMELESS AND THE ABSOLUTE ONE
2902-9008-0007 AYE TO BELIEVE AGAINST THE AUTHORITY OF PORHYRY HIMSELF TOO IN EVIL EYES AND MAGIC
2902-9008-0008 WHAT DO YOU CARE FOR FOOD
2902-9008-0009 HOW CAN HE WHOSE SPHERE LIES BENEATH THE STARS STOOP EVERY MOMENT TO EARTH
2902-9008-0010 AY AY SHE ANSWERED HALF BITTERLY AND WOULD THAT WE COULD LIVE WITHOUT FOOD AND IMITATE PERFECTLY THE IMMORTAL GODS
2902-9008-0011 THERE IS FRUIT WITH LENTILS AND RICE WAITING FOR YOU IN THE NEXT ROOM AND BREAD UNLESS YOU DESPISE IT MUCH
2902-9008-0012 STRANGE THAT MEN SHOULD BE CONTENT TO GRAVEL AND BE MEN WHEN THEY MIGHT RISE TO THE RANK OF GODS
2902-9008-0013 NOT THAT SUCH A CREATURE AS THAT DISTURBS ME NO CREATED THINGS I HOPE CAN MOVE MY EQUANIMITY BUT IF I COULD STOOP TO HATE I SHOULD HATE HER HATE HER
2902-9008-0014 AND HER VOICE TOOK A TONE WHICH MADE IT SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN WHETHER IN SPITE OF ALL THE LOFTY IMPASSIBILITY THAT SHE FELT BOUND TO POSSESS SHE DID NOT HATE PELAGIA WITH A MOST HUMAN AND MUNDANE HATRED
2902-9008-0015 HIS MAJESTY MADAME THE PREFECT
2902-9008-0016 AND WHY SHOULD THAT DISTURB YOU LET HIM ENTER
3000-15664-0000 JASTA RAMBLES AND MODOC MEMORIES
3000-15664-0001 ARCTIC BEAUTY AND DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ALL MAY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLIMBERS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING ALONG ITS WARM FERTILE BASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS
3000-15664-0002 PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERYBODY SHALL BE KIND AT LEAST TO HIMSELF
3000-15664-0003 GO QUIETLY ON NO HARM WILL BEFALL YOU
3000-15664-0004 BUT THAT IS FAR BETTER TO GO AFOOT
3000-15664-0005 ONE BLANKET WILL BE ENOUGH TO CARRY OR YOU MAY FOREGO THE PLEASURE AND BURDEN ALTOGETHER AS WOOD FOR FIRES IS ALWAYS ABUNDANT
3000-15664-0006 ONLY A LITTLE FOOD MIGHT BE REQUIRED
3000-15664-0007 THUS HE SAUNTERS ON AND ON IN THE GLORIOUS RADIANCE IN UTTER PEACE AND FORGETFULNESS OF TIME
3000-15664-0008 YET STRANGE TO SAY THERE ARE DAYS EVEN HERE SOMEWHAT DULL LOOKING WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SEEMS UNCOMMUNICATIVE SENDING OFF NO APPRECIABLE INVITATION AS IF NOT AT HOME
3000-15664-0009 AT SUCH TIME ITS HEIGHT SEEMS MUCH LESS AS IF CROUCHING AND WAITING IT WERE TAKING REST
3000-15664-0010 EVERYTHING CRYSTAL DANCES RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCHES OF THE SUN AND THE CURRANTS OF SAP IN THE GROWING CELLS OF ALL THE VEGETATION ARE EVER IN A VITAL WHIRL AND RUSH AND THOUGH MANY FEET AND WINGS ARE FOLDED HOW MANY ARE ASTIR
3000-15664-0011 SLIGHT RAINSTORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A TRIP ROUND THE MOUNTAINS BUT ONE MAY EASILY FIND SHELTER BENEATH WELL THATCHED TREES THAT SHED THE RAIN LIKE A ROOF
3000-15664-0012 THEN THE SHINING OF THE WET LEAVES IS DELIGHTFUL AND THE STEAMY FRAGRANCE AND THE BURSTS OF BIRDS SONG FROM A MULTITUDE OF THRUSHES AND FINCHES AND WARBLERS THAT HAVE NESTS IN THE CHAPPARAL
3000-15664-0013 A THOUSAND THOUSAND VOICES HAVE HEARD BUT SO FINELY BLENDED THEY SEEM A PART OF THE NIGHT ITSELF AND MAKE A DEEPER SILENCE
3000-15664-0014 IN SETTING OUT FROM STRAWBERRY VALLEY BY BEARING OFF TO THE NORTH WESTWARD A FEW MILES YOU MIGHT SEE
3000-15664-0015 IN APPROACHING IT ITS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING YELLOW SPOTTED HOODED AND WATCHFUL ATTITUDE WILL BE LIKELY TO MAKE YOU GO CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE BOG WHERE IT STANDS AS IF YOU WERE APPROACHING A DANGEROUS SNAKE
3000-15664-0016 IT IS LINED WITH EMERALD ALGAE AND MOSSES AND SHADED WITH ALDER WILLOW AND THORN BUSH WHICH GIVE IT A FINE SETTING
3000-15664-0017 IT IS THREE OR FOUR MILES LONG AND TERMINATES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN MORAINE FRINGED ICE CLIFFS SIXTY FEET HIGH
3000-15664-0018 THE LONG GREY SLOPES LEADING UP TO A GLACIER SEEM REMARKABLY SMOOTH AND UNBROKEN
3000-15664-0019 MOST OF THE DRAINAGE OF THE GLACIER VANISHES AT ONCE IN THE POROUS ROCKS TO APPEAR IN SPRINGS IN THE DISTANT VALLEY AND IT IS ONLY IN TIME OF FLOOD THAT THE CHANNEL CARRIES MUCH WATER THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL FINE FALLS IN THE GORGE SIXTEEN HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT
3000-15664-0020 TRACING THIS WILD CHANGING CHANNEL GORGE GULLY OR CANYON THE SECTIONS WILL SHOW MOUNT SHASTA AS THE HUGE PALAUMPSYST CONTAINING THE RECORDS LAYER UPON LAYER OF STRANGELY CONTRASTED EVENTS IN ITS FIERY ICY HISTORY
3000-15664-0021 REGAINING THE LOW GROUND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HOLDING ON IN YOUR GRAND ORBIT YOU PASS THROUGH A BELT OF JUNIPER WOODS CALLED THE CEDARS TO SHEEP BROTH AT THE FOOT OF THE SHASTA PASS
3000-15664-0022 HERE YOU TAKE THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD WHICH LEADS OVER THE LOW DIVIDE TO THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN
3000-15664-0023 MOUNT BREMER IS THE MOST NOTED STRONGHOLD OF THE SHEEP AND THE WHOLE SHASTA REGION
3000-15664-0024 LARGE FLOCKS DWELL HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WINTER AND SUMMER DESCENDING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE ADJACENT SAGE PLANTS AND LAVA BEDS TO FEED BUT EVER READY TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE JAGGED CRAGS OF THEIR MOUNTAIN AT EVERY ALARM
3000-15664-0025 WHILE TRAVELING WITH A COMPANY OF HUNTERS I SAW ABOUT THIRTY IN ONE FLOCK
3000-15664-0026 THE NEW DEER ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY
3000-15664-0027 THEIR LONG MASSIVE KNEES GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE
3000-15664-0028 BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOODS ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE IN THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD THE EYE
3000-15664-0029 THEN FELL THE GLOAMING MAKING EVERYBODY STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS
3000-15664-0030 THEN THE DARKNESS LIKE DEATH
3000-15664-0031 TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRONGHOLD OF THE MODOCS HELD BY HIM SO LONG AND DEFIANTLY AGAINST ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK
3000-15664-0032 THE DUCKS LESS WARY KEPT THEIR PLACE MERELY SWIMMING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND RAISING SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE
3000-15664-0033 THEY ARE BROAD RUGGED CREVASSED CLOUDLIKE MASSES OF BROWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING AND SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVERLIKE GO WINDING DOWN THE VALLEYS THROUGH THE FORESTS TO THE SEA
3000-15664-0034 THUS THE SHASTA RIVER ISSUES FROM THE LARGE LAKE LIKE SPRING IN SHASTA VALLEY AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE VOLUME OF THE MC CLOUD GUSHES FORTH IN A GRAND SPRING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN A FEW MILES BACK FROM ITS IMMEDIATE BASE
3000-15664-0035 SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEM SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE FIT RIVER THEN YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT
3000-15664-0036 UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YOU MAY HEAR THE ROAR OF THE WATER RUSHING FROM THE ROCK AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OR EVEN MORE OR YOU MAY HEAR IT UNTIL WITHIN A FEW RODS
3000-15664-0037 THE VIVID GREEN OF THE BOULDERS BENEATH THE WATER IS VERY STRIKING AND COLOURS THE ENTIRE STREAMS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORTIONS BROKEN INTO FOAM
3000-15664-0038 ASPLENIUM EPILOBIUM HUCHERA HAZEL DOGWOOD AND ALDER MAKE A LUXURIOUS FRINGE AND SETTING AND THE FORESTS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE ALONG THE BANKS ARE THE FINEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE SIERRA
3000-15664-0039 TRACING RIVERS TO THEIR FOUNTAINS MAKES THE MOST CHARMING TRAVELS
3000-15664-0040 AS THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE LANDSCAPES THE BEAST OF THE WILDERNESS COMES TO THEIR BANKS AND NOT ONE DULL PASSAGE IS FOUND IN ALL THEIR EVENTFUL HISTORIES
3000-15664-0041 TRACING THE MC CLOUD TO ITS HIGHEST SPRINGS AND OVER THE DIVIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF FALL RIVER NEAR FORT CROOK THENCE DOWN THAT RIVER TO ITS CONFLUENTS WITH THE PIT ON FROM THERE TO THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTTE THROUGH THE BIG MEADOWS ALONG THE SOURCES OF THE FEATHER RIVER AND DOWN THROUGH FORESTS OF SUGAR PINE TO THE FERTILE PLAINS OF CHICO THIS IS A GLORIOUS SAUNTER AND IMPOSES NO HARDSHIP
3000-15664-0042 THE ASCENT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE IS AN EASY WALK AND THE VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT WERE EXTREMELY TELLING
3000-15664-0043 THE LOFTY ICY SHASTA TOWERING HIGH ABOVE ALL IS BUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM YOU THOUGH THE DISTANCE IN AN AIR LINE IS ABOUT SIXTY MILES
3000-15664-0044 THE BIG MEADOWS LIE NEAR THE FOOT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE A BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS BASIN SET IN THE HEART OF THE RICHLY FORESTED MOUNTAINS SCARCELY SURPASSED IN THE GRANDEUR OF ITS SURROUNDINGS BY TALO
3000-15664-0045 THE GREAT WILDS OF OUR COUNTRY ONCE HELD TO BE BOUNDLESS AND INEXHAUSTIBLE ARE BEING RAPIDLY INVADED AND OVERRUN IN EVERY DIRECTION AND EVERYTHING DESTRUCTIBLE IN THEM BEING DESTROYED
3000-15664-0046 EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLING AND HARRIED
3081-166546-0000 WHEN I TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
3081-166546-0001 INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GRASS
3081-166546-0002 WELL AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
3081-166546-0003 A LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR AUNT
3081-166546-0004 THE BOYS BELONG TO THIS GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
3081-166546-0005 GEORGE WANTED
3081-166546-0006 THE BOYS LOOK QUITE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE MOTHER DOES NOT
3081-166546-0007 DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISTER CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
3081-166546-0008 JACK
3081-166546-0009 HAS YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE
3081-166546-0010 I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE WAS SO IMPROBABLE
3081-166546-0011 THE BOYS LOOKING WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
3081-166546-0012 A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE ORCHARD BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
3081-166546-0013 I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL UPON HIS FURTIVE WATCHER
3081-166546-0014 I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHILE
3081-166546-0015 I AM LOOKING TO HIM NOW
3081-166546-0016 NOT AN EVERY DAY DEDUCTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOROUGH
3081-166546-0017 YES HE'S MERCUR IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
3081-166546-0018 WHAT DOES HE WANT TO
3081-166546-0019 I ASKED AS SOON AS JIM HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
3081-166546-0020 HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND HIM
3081-166546-0021 NO I EMPHASIZED COMPLACENTLY
3081-166546-0022 HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLED PROBLEMS AS THESE
3081-166546-0023 HE GAVE UP WORK SOMETIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALLEURMENT FOR HIM
3081-166546-0024 THE TRIAL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
3081-166546-0025 I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SOON
3081-166546-0026 HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALWAYS FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
3081-166546-0027 HOWEVER HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT
3081-166546-0028 THIS WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE
3081-166546-0029 THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO UTTERLY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT
3081-166546-0030 THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE OTHER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
3081-166546-0031 THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS THEM
3081-166546-0032 IT'S THAT MOST INEXPLICABLE THERE
3081-166546-0033 BUT CLEUES THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
3081-166546-0034 THAT IS WE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
3081-166546-0035 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT THEY HOPE
3081-166546-0036 IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND DRYCE
3081-166546-0037 THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED FROM THE FLOOR
3081-166546-0038 I HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
3081-166546-0039 NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND THE SUDDEN FALL
3081-166546-0040 IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK LIKE A BOLT FROM HEAVEN
3081-166546-0041 WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF IT GRYCE
3081-166546-0042 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE VESSEL YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
3081-166546-0043 A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAS BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD
3081-166546-0044 HE WAS THE PLAIN VOICED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE
3081-166546-0045 HIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGEE'S AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVORITE
3081-166546-0046 BERN OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY
3081-166546-0047 VERY WELL THEN YOU'M IN A POSITION TO PIONEER ME
3081-166546-0048 WELL WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST AT ALL EVENTS
3081-166546-0049 BUT I AM IN NO POSITION TO GIVE PROMISES
3081-166546-0050 OTHER DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
3081-166546-0051 WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK IN A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW
3081-166546-0052 ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALLS
3081-166546-0053 NATURALLY THEY REACH HER FIRST
3081-166546-0054 MARK SOWERBY AND KLAUS HEENERBERG
3081-166546-0055 HONEST GERMANS THEY WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS
3081-166546-0056 WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE OF THE LOBBY
3081-166546-0057 ANYBODY BEFORE HIS FATHER CAME IN
3081-166546-0058 OH YES MISS CLARK THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARISHES
3081-166546-0059 I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED EVERY I SHOULD SAY
3081-166546-0060 AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO LESSON
3081-166546-0061 NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HERE DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING
3081-166546-0062 YES MISTER SCLATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED
3081-166546-0063 NO DOUBT HE
3081-166546-0064 SWEETWATER SOME ONE DREW THAT OUT
3081-166546-0065 NOT NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
3081-166546-0066 WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAST
3081-166546-0067 IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THAT PLACE
3081-166546-0068 BUT WE'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
3081-166546-0069 VERY VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL
3081-166546-0070 I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELLING HER I'M AN OLD AND RHEUMATIC INVALID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS
3081-166546-0071 AND HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE
3081-166546-0072 THERE WAS NO DOUBTING HER IN THIS INSTANCE
3081-166546-0073 THIS
3081-166546-0074 FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MOMENT BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY
3081-166546-0075 YES SIR MANY TIMES
3081-166546-0076 WHAT MADE THEIR DIFFERENCE
3081-166546-0077 MISS CLARK STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY HAD I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY
3081-166546-0078 NO A VERY TERRIBLE ONE I SHOULD SAY
3081-166546-0079 AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION
3081-166546-0080 I KNOW SHE SAID WHY YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW
3081-166546-0081 THERE WAS NO POYARD IN THE WOUND
3081-166546-0082 THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THE ONE MISS CLARK WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER
3081-166546-0083 BUT I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
3081-166546-0084 SWEETWATER YOU HELP ME OUT OF THIS
3081-166546-0085 BUT VIGOR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARK AND RETURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR
3081-166546-0086 THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS CHILD'S ARMS
3081-166546-0087 NO WEAPONS PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWS
3081-166546-0088 SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THIS STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
3081-166546-0089 IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WOULD BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
3170-137482-0000 WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE INSURED ME AN HONORABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GREAT PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED
3170-137482-0001 I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE HOUSES WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY
3170-137482-0002 I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY BUT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE
3170-137482-0003 BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES SINCE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL
3170-137482-0004 OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO GREAT DANGER
3170-137482-0005 SHE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKES
3170-137482-0006 WE DID THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE ALSO SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCELLENT HEALTH
3170-137482-0007 WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLIER MASS
3170-137482-0008 THIS IS THIS AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS
3170-137482-0009 IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED PEGASINO
3170-137482-0010 YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH THE RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY
3170-137482-0011 THE WAITER OF THE MAGGISINO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH
3170-137482-0012 WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS A LARGE BOAT
3170-137482-0013 WHO IS MY HUSBAND
3170-137482-0014 NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE IT AGAIN TO MORROW
3170-137482-0015 OUR READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BADE US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH
3170-137482-0016 TEN DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF
3170-137482-0017 AND WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO LORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING
3170-137482-0018 THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT THE FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED
3170-137482-0019 I PICKED IT UP AND COMING BACK TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM
3170-137482-0020 I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM INTO THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
3170-137482-0021 I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
3170-137482-0022 I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RIRETTA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I INQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
3170-137482-0023 TAKING EVERY THING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR THE PHYSICIAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLED AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME
3170-137482-0024 THINKING I HAD THE RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED AND GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
3170-137482-0025 THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ANSWER ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE
3170-137482-0026 HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA AND HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM
3170-137482-0027 THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO HIS CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION
3170-137482-0028 DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT YOU LAY DOWN AGAIN
3170-137482-0029 IT ENTREATED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH
3170-137482-0030 WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS CAN SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
3170-137482-0031 UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMERAL CALCULUS WHICH MADE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKED TO PUT
3170-137482-0032 I OBEYED IMPLICITLY AND FOUND YOUR EXCELLENCY
3170-137482-0033 THE THREE SERVANTS WERE ASTOUNDED
3170-137482-0034 I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING THOUGH IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
3170-137482-0035 HE WROTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT NOR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
3170-137482-0036 IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
3170-137482-0037 THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES IN MY SUBLIME CALCULUS
3170-137482-0038 NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I SHOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANY ONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION
3170-137482-0039 THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS AND THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY PROFOUND SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE
3170-137482-0040 BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KINDLY HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
3170-137482-0041 THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN NOBLE DEVOTEES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES
3170-137482-0042 AS FOR THE EUCHARIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT A PALPABLE EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT JESUITS
3170-137482-0043 I MIGHT HAVE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISHED TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM
3170-137482-0044 BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENA THEY MET WITH WHICH THE NARROW INTELLECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND
3170-137482-0045 WHO YOU MAY BE I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE
3170-137482-0046 YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SAVE YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GONDOLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEQUINS A MONTH
3170-137482-0047 YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THAT FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVISER IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND
3170-137482-0048 I THRUST MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER
3536-23268-0000 SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH DORRIFORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HORTON THAT LORD FREDERICK'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM WITHOUT A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION
3536-23268-0001 EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSIONS FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS
3536-23268-0002 YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISTER WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE
3536-23268-0003 NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY FEARS FOR HER WHEN ABROAD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLAMOR OF THE RETURN
3536-23268-0004 I SUPPOSE MISS MILNER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
3536-23268-0005 I THOUGHT MISS WILNER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
3536-23268-0006 YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD GIVE MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT
3536-23268-0007 MISSUS HORTON ROSE FROM HER SEAT MOVED THE DECANTERS AND FRUIT ROUND THE TABLE STIRRED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK INTO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED
3536-23268-0008 NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFICIOUS LABORS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSTLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED ITS FULL FORCE
3536-23268-0009 MISS MILNER WE SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR
3536-23268-0010 AND HE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THIS APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR
3536-23268-0011 HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TO MISSUS HORTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING
3536-23268-0012 IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT FOR THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HERS
3536-23268-0013 DO YOU THINK I WOULD COME ANSWERED MISS MILNER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL
3536-23268-0014 IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I THINK NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW
3536-23268-0015 NIECE I DEMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THE ROOM THIS EVENING
3536-23268-0016 MISS WOODLY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED
3536-23268-0017 AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DORRIFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSTRACT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND
3536-23268-0018 MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THAT JINGLE OF A TEASPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET
3536-23268-0019 MISSUS HORTON TOO IN HER SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE
3536-23268-0020 MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES THAT ACCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM
3536-23268-0021 HE COUGHED DRANK HIS TEA ENDEAVOURED TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES READ AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MILNER CAME INTO THE ROOM NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER
3536-23268-0022 DORIFORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARDONED IT
3536-23268-0023 AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT UPON THE PART OF MISSUS HORTON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUTIFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILNER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA
3536-23268-0024 DORRIFORTH THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGINNING
3536-23268-0025 IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANLY
3536-23268-0026 FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICES AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM
3536-23268-0027 WHAT HE SAID HE THOUGHT WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPRESSED
3536-23268-0028 SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPTS SHE DESISTED
3536-23268-0029 ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND COMING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHOW YOUR SUBMISSION BY OBEYING ME A SECOND TIME TO DAY
3536-23268-0030 KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE SURE THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUMSPECTION FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRICTLY THEY ARE COMPLIED WITH
3536-8226-0000 IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE LADY MILBURGH SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES
3536-8226-0001 AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BASLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICES
3536-8226-0002 AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOR
3536-8226-0003 IN DOING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL
3536-8226-0004 MISSUS BOSLL WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER
3536-8226-0005 AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY LAWYERS
3536-8226-0006 A DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TREVELLIAN ON TREVELLIAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
3536-8226-0007 OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOSSIL
3536-8226-0008 A PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BASLE'S LAW
3536-8226-0009 HE CAN'T SUCKLE EM KINNNY
3536-8226-0010 WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVEIN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
3536-8226-0011 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS BEA EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOSOIL IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOSSIL TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD
3536-8226-0012 DRAT EM ALL IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS
3536-8226-0013 IT'S THAT AS MAKES EM I WON'T SAY THAT
3536-8226-0014 BUT AS FOR THIS THERE CHILD BE
3536-8226-0015 TRANSVELLION HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
3536-8226-0016 DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BOSSELL LIVE HERE ASKED TRAVELLION
3536-8226-0017 THEN BASLER CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
3536-8226-0018 BUT TRELLION WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
3536-8226-0019 BASIL HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND GREEN SHOES
3536-8226-0020 IT WAS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BASIL TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
3536-8226-0021 PERHAPS YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TREVELLIAN
3536-8226-0022 MISSUS BASEL WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
3536-8226-0023 BASIL AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS CLOAK BUTTONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
3536-8226-0024 I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TREVEILION
3536-8226-0025 IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKINT SIR SUGGESTED BASLE
3536-8226-0026 AS HE WENT UP HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GAIT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
3536-8226-0027 AND ALL WORK HAD CEASED WITH IT
3536-8226-0028 HE'S OUT IN TOWN SIR A MINDING OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
3536-8226-0029 I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS POSSIBLE CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
3536-8226-0030 BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN CASE THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE
3536-8226-0031 THEN BASIL AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
3536-8226-0032 BUT HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BASIL STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK
3576-138058-0000 MASTER AND MAN DISMOUNTED FROM THEIR BEASTS AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES AT THE FOOT OF THE TREES SANCHO WHO HAD HAD A GOOD NOONTIDE MEAL THAT DAY LET HIMSELF WITHOUT MORE ADO PASSED THE GATE OF SLEEP
3576-138058-0001 BUT DON QUIXOTE WHOM HIS THOUGHTS FAR MORE THAN ANGER KEPT AWAKE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE AND ROAMED IN FANCY TO AND FRO THROUGH ALL SORTS OF PLACES
3576-138058-0002 AT ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS AND SAW DULCINEA TRANSFORMED INTO A COUNTRY WENCH SKIPPING AND MOUNTING UPON HER SHE ASS AND AGAIN THAT THE WORDS OF THE SAGE MERLIN WERE SOUNDING IN HIS EARS SETTING FORTH THE CONDITIONS TO BE OBSERVED AND THE EXERTIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE DISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA
3576-138058-0003 WHO IS HURTING ME AND UNTRUSSING ME
3576-138058-0004 DULCINEA IS PERISHING THOU ART LIVING ON REGARDLESS I AM DYING OF HOPE DEFERRED THEREFORE INTRUST THYSELF WITH THE GOOD WILL FOR MINE IT IS HERE IN THIS RETIRED SPOT TO GIVE THEE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND LASHES
3576-138058-0005 SEEING THIS SANCHO GOT UP AND GRAPPLING WITH HIS MASTER HE GRIPPED HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN HIS ARMS GIVING HIM THE TRIP WITH THE HEEL STRETCHED HIM ON THE GROUND ON HIS BACK AND PRESSING HIS RIGHT KNEE ON HIS CHEST HELD HIS HANDS IN HIS OWN SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER MOVE NOR BREATHE
3576-138058-0006 HOW THE TRAITOR EXCLAIMED DON QUIXOTE
3576-138058-0007 DOST THOU REVOLT AGAINST THY MASTER AND A NATURAL LORD
3576-138058-0008 DOST THOU RISE AGAINST HIM WHO GIVES THEE THY BREAD
3576-138058-0009 DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS HOUSE NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE AND TO HIS OWN DISCRETION TO WHIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASED
3576-138058-0010 SANCHO ROSE AND REMOVED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SPOT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST ANOTHER TREE HE FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIS HEAD AND TURNING UP HIS HANDS ENCOUNTERED SOMEBODY'S TWO FEET WITH SHOES AND STOCKINGS ON THEM
3576-138058-0011 HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND MADE FOR ANOTHER TREE WHICH THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE FELL A SHOUTING CALLING UPON DON QUIXOTE TO COME AND PROTECT HIM
3576-138058-0012 DON QUIXOTE DID SO AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHAT HE WAS AFRAID
3576-138058-0013 SANCHO REPLIED THAT ALL THE TREES WAS FULL OF MEN'S FEET AND LEGS
3576-138058-0014 DON QUIXOTE WAS ON FOOT WITH HIS HORSE UNBRIDLED AND HIS LANCE LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND IN SHORT COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS HE THOUGHT IT BEST THEREFORE TO FOLD HIS ARMS AND BOW HIS HEAD AND RESERVED HIMSELF FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE OCCASION AND OPPORTUNITY
3576-138058-0015 HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH FOUR OF THE PISTOLS THEY CALL PETRONELLAS IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST
3576-138058-0016 HE SAW THAT HIS SQUIRES FOR SO THEY CALL THOSE WHO FOLLOW THAT TRADE WERE ABOUT TO RIFLE SANCHO PANZA BUT HE ORDERED THEM TO DESIST AND WAS AT ONCE OBEYED AND THE GIRDLE ESCAPED
3576-138058-0017 HE SAW ME HE PAID COURT TO ME I LISTENED TO HIM AND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER I LOVED HIM FOR THERE IS NO WOMAN HOWEVER SECLUDED SHE MAY LIVE OR CLOSE SHE MAY BE KEPT WHO WILL NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO DESPAIR FOR FOLLOWING HER HEADLONG IMPULSES
3576-138058-0018 IN A WORD HE PLEDGED HIMSELF TO BE MINE AND I PROMISED TO BE HIS WITHOUT HEARING MATTERS ANY FURTHER
3576-138058-0019 GIVE ME MY HORSE AND HORSES AND WAIT FOR ME HERE I WILL GO IN QUEST OF THIS KNIGHT AND DEAD OR ALIVE I WILL MAKE HIM KEEP HIS WORD PLIGHTED TO SO GREAT A BEAUTY
3576-138058-0020 NOBODY NEED HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT SAID SANCHO FOR MY MASTER HAS A VERY HAPPY KNACK OF MATCHMAKING IT'S NOT MANY DAYS SINCE HE FORCED ANOTHER MAN TO MARRY WHO IN THE SAME WAY BACKED OUT OF HIS PROMISE TO ANOTHER MAIDEN AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIS PERSECUTORS THE ENCHANTERS'S CHANGING THE MAN'S PROPER SHAPE INTO A LACKEY'S THE SAID MAIDEN WOULD NOT BE WON THIS MINUTE
3576-138058-0021 THEY MADE HASTE TO OVERTAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY RODE SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH EASE
3576-138058-0022 THE WOUNDED GENTLEMAN OPENED HIS ALL BUT CLOSED EYES AND RECOGNIZING CLAUDIA SAID I SEE CLEARLY FAIR AND MISTAKEN LADY THAT IT IS THOU THAT HAST SLAIN ME A PUNISHMENT NOT MERITED OR DESERVED BY MY FEELINGS TOWARD THEE FOR NEVER DID I MEAN TO NOR CAN I WRONG THEE IN THOUGHT OR DEED
3576-138058-0023 IT IS NOT TRUE THEN SAID CLAUDIA THAT THOU WERT GOING THIS MORNING TO MARRY LEONORA THE DAUGHTER OF THE RICH PALVESTRO
3576-138058-0024 ON PERCEIVING THIS CLAUDIA WHEN SHE HAD CONVINCED HERSELF THAT HER BELOVED HUSBAND WAS NO MORE BENT THE AIR WITH HER SIGHS AND MADE THE HEAVENS RING WITH HER LAMENTATIONS SHE TORE HER HAIR AND SCATTERED IT TO THE WINDS SHE BEAT HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AND SHOWED ALL THE SIGNS OF GRIEF AND SORROW THAT COULD BE CONCEIVED TO COME FROM AN AFFLICTED HEART
3576-138058-0025 CRUEL RECKLESS WOMAN SHE CRIED HOW EASILY WERT THOU MOVED TO CARRY ON A THOUGHT SO WICKED
3576-138058-0026 O HUSBAND WHOSE UNHAPPY FATE IN BEING MINE HAD BORNE THEE FROM THE MARRIAGE BED TO THE GRAVE
3576-138058-0027 THE SERVANTS WEPT CLAUDIUS SWOONED AWAY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THE WHOLE PLACE BECAME A FIELD OF SORROW AND AN ABODE OF MISFORTUNE
3576-138058-0028 CLAUDIA TOLD HIM SHE MEANT TO GO TO A MONASTERY OF WHICH AN AUNT OF HERS WAS ABBASE WHERE SHE INTENDED TO PASS HER LIFE WITH A BETTER AND EVERLASTING SPOUSE
3576-138058-0029 CLAUDIA WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT ALLOW HIM TO ACCOMPANY HIM AND THANKING HIM FOR HIS OFFERS AS WELL AS SHE COULD TOOK LEAVE OF HIM IN TEARS
3576-138058-0030 SARAH SAID THEY HAD BUT THAT THREE KERCHIEFS THAT WERE WORTH THREE CITIES WERE MISSING

3576-138058-0032 SAID ONE OF THE BYSTANDERS I HAVE GOT THEM AND THEY ARE NOT WORTH THIRTY REELS
3576-138058-0033 AT THIS INSTANT ONE OR TWO OF THOSE SQUIRES WHO WERE POSTED AS SENTINELS ON THE ROADS TO WATCH WHO CAME ALONG THEM AND REPORT WHAT PASSED TO THE CHIEF CAME UP AND SAID SENOR THERE IS A GREAT TROOP OF PEOPLE NOT FAR OFF COMING ALONG THE ROAD TO BARCELONA
3576-138058-0034 WHAT LED ME INTO IT WAS A CERTAIN THIRST FOR VENGEANCE WHICH IS STRANGE ENOUGH TO DISTURB THE QUIETEST HEARTS

3576-138058-0037 THE CAPTAINS SHOWED PLAINLY THE CONCERN THEY FELT THE REGENT'S LADY WAS DOWNCAST AND THE PILGRIMS DID NOT AT ALL ENJOY SEEING HER PROPERTY CONFISCATED
3576-138058-0038 THE REGENT'S LADY ORDERED ONE OF HER SERVANTS TO GIVE THE EIGHTY CROWNS THAT HAD BEEN ASSESSED AS HER SHARE AT ONCE FOR THE CAPTAINS HAD ALWAYS PAID DOWN THEIR SIXTY
3576-138058-0039 ONE OF THE SQUIRES OBSERVED IN HIS MIXTURE OF GASCON AND CATALAN THIS CAPTAIN OF OURS COULD MAKE A BETTER FRIAR THAN A HIGHWAYMAN IF HE WANTS TO BE SO GENEROUS ANOTHER TIME LET IT BE WITH HIS OWN PROPERTY AND NOT OURS

3752-4944-0021 SO HE WENT ON TO THE VERANDA AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE LIGHTS OF THE PRISON AND LISTENED TO THE SEA LAPPING THE SHORE
3752-4944-0022 BY AND BY A SHORT FIGURE SMOKING A CHEROOT CAME UP OUT OF THE DARK AND PROVED TO BE DOCTOR MACKELWAYIN WHO HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM ATTENDING THE DINNER BY REASON OF AN ACCIDENT TO A CONSTABLE AT NORFOLK BAY WHICH HAD CLAIMED HIS PROFESSIONAL ATTENTION
3752-4944-0023 DEAD SAID DOCTOR MACKEWAIN
3752-4944-0024 DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU MISTER MALKIN
3752-4944-0025 BUT MACELVANE WAS TIRED AND WANTED TO GET HOME
3752-4944-0026 OUR ROADS LIE TOGETHER DOCTORS
3752-4944-0027 BEFORE THE TWO CLERGYMEN HAD GOT HALF WAY DOWN THE STEEP PATH THAT LED FROM THE COMMANDANT'S HOUSE TO THE FLAT ON WHICH THE COTTAGES OF THE DOCTOR AND CHAPLAIN WERE BUILT MACKELWANE REJOINED THEM
3752-4944-0028 ANOTHER FLOGGED TO MORROW SAID HE GRUMBLINGLY
3752-4944-0029 WHOM IS HE GOING TO FLOG THEN
3752-4944-0030 YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY HE IS GOING TO FLOG KIRKLIN
3752-4944-0031 PERHAPS YOU'LL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ALLOW ME TO BE THE BEST JUDGE OF THAT RETURNED MACKELWAYIN DRAWING UP HIS LITTLE BODY TO ITS LEAST INSIGNIFICANT STATURE
3752-4944-0032 MISTER MEEKIN EXPRESSED SOME ALARM BUT DOCTOR MACKELWANE REASSURED HIM

3752-4944-0035 HE SLEEPS ON THE BACK AND NORTH HURRIED OFF
3752-4944-0036 AN IMPULSIVE GENTLEMAN SAID MIKIN TO MACKELWAYN AS THE SOUND OF MISTER NORTH'S FOOTSTEPS DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE
3752-4944-0037 MACKLE WAYNE SHOOK HIS HEAD SERIOUSLY
3752-4944-0038 HE HAS THE STRONGST FITS AT TIMES
3752-4944-0039 UNLESS IT'S A CANCER IN THE STOMACH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT CAN BE CANCER IN THE STUMP

3752-4944-0045 THEN DIDN'T YOU INTERFERE WITH ME SIR
3752-4944-0046 I'VE GIVEN YOUR ORDERS SIR
3752-4944-0047 THAN CAPTAIN BURGESS CRIED NORTH HIS PALE FACE FLUSHING I TELL YOU THE BOY'S BLOOD WILL BE ON YOUR HEAD
3752-4944-0048 I AM A MINISTER OF GOD SIR AND I FORBID YOU TO PERMIT THIS CRIME
3752-4944-0049 DAMN MY IMPERTINENCE SIR BURST OUT BURGESS
3752-4944-0050 YOU'RE A MISSED OFFICER OF THE GOVERNMENT SIR
3752-4944-0051 THIS OF COURSE WAS MERE BRAVADO ON THE PART OF THE COMMANDANTS
3752-4944-0052 NORTH KNEW WELL THAT HE WOULD NEVER DARE TO ATTEMPT ANY SUCH ACT OF VIOLENCE BUT THE RESULT STUNG HIM LIKE THE CUT OF A WHIP
3752-4944-0053 SHOW MISTER NORTH OUT HE SAID AND GO DOWN TO THE BARRACKS AND TELL TROKE THAT KIRKLAND IS TO HAVE ONE HUNDRED LASHES TO MORROW
3752-4944-0054 I'LL SHOW YOU WHO'S MASTERS HERE MY GOOD SIR
3752-4944-0055 THIS IS A MURDEROUS
3752-4944-0056 THE GOVERNMENT MAY GO IN AND YOU TOO ROARED BURGESS GET OUT
3752-4944-0057 THEY SHALL NOT FLOG THAT BOY SHE SAID
3752-4944-0058 I'LL REPORT THEM TO THE GOVERNMENT
3752-4944-0059 I WISH I HADN'T TAKEN THAT BRANDY HE SAID FOOL AS I AM
3752-4944-0060 OH GOD GIVE ME STRENGTH AID ME AND HELP ME
3752-4944-0061 YOU LORD LOOK DOWN UPON ME
3752-4944-0062 HE MIXED A TEASPOONFUL THIS IN A PANNIKIN OF WATER AND DRANK IT
3752-4944-0063 IT RELIEVES HIM FOR A WHILE
3752-4944-0064 IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD REACHED THE CRISIS OF A DISEASE WHICH HAD BEEN FOR DAYS GATHERING STRENGTH
3752-4944-0065 I MUST HAVE A TEASPOON FULL HE SAID TO ALLAY THE CRAVING
3752-4944-0066 TWICE HE PAUSED ON THE WAY TO A SITTING ROOM AND TWICE WAS HE DRIVEN ON BY A POWER STRONGER THAN HIS WILL
3752-4944-0067 HE SMELT THE NUTRY AROMA OF THE SPIRIT
3752-4944-0068 THAT AT ALL TIMES DEBASING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME IT WAS INFAMOUS THAT A VICE UNWORTHY OF ANY MAN WAS DOUBLY SINFUL TO A MAN OF EDUCATION AND A MINISTER OF GOD IN VAIN
3752-4944-0069 IN THE MIDST OF HIS ARGUMENTS HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THAT CUPBOARD WITH THE BOTTLE AT HIS LIPS IN AN ATTITUDE THAT WAS AT ONCE LUDICROUS AND HORRIBLE
3853-163249-0000 OUR MEETING WITH LETTY WAS INDESCRIBABLY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN NURSING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER
3853-163249-0001 BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEGRUDGED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS IF THE DREAM WERE TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID
3853-163249-0002 SO CHRISTIE TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HER PROPHETIC SOUL AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO A BLISSFUL HOLIDAY THAT HAD COME AT LAST
3853-163249-0003 NOTHING CAN SURPRISE ME NOW I'M PREPARED FOR ANYTHING EVEN THE SIGHT OF MY QUAKERISH LOVE DANCING A JIG
3853-163249-0004 I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON I MUST ENJOY MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY
3853-163249-0005 I'M NOT A TALKER YOU KNOW AND AS THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION FORBID MY SOARING ALOFT ANYWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UPLIFTING STATE OF MIND BY PRANCING AS YOU CALL IT
3853-163249-0006 I DON'T WANT YOU TO I LOVE TO SEE YOU SO YOUNG AND HAPPY ONLY YOU ARE NOT THE OLD BABY AND I'VE GOT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW ONE
3853-163249-0007 I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE HIM BETTER THAN THE FROSTBITTEN OLD DAVID YOU FIRST KNEW AND WERE KIND ENOUGH TO LIKE
3853-163249-0008 MOTHER SAYS I'VE GONE BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE WE LOST LETTY AND I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF I HAVE
3853-163249-0009 IN THAT CASE YOU WILL FIND ME A PROUD IMPETUOUS AMBITIOUS FELLOW CRISPIE AND HOW WILL THAT SUIT
3853-163249-0010 EXCELLENTLY I LIKE PRIDE OF YOUR SORT IMPETUOSITY BECOMES YOU BEFORE YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL IT IF NEED BE AND THE AMBITION IS BEST OF ALL
3853-163249-0011 I SHALL WAIT FOR A TIME TO SHOW
3853-163249-0012 THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR WORK LITTLE DREAMING AS THEY TIED ROSES AND TWINED SIMULLACS WREATHS HOW NEAR THAT OTHER CHANCE WAS HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE AND HOW WELL EACH WAS TO PERFORM THE PART GIVEN THEM IN LIFE AND DEATH
3853-163249-0013 TO NO HOME IN THE WORLD DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LANE
3853-163249-0014 DAVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A FLASH IN HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UNSPOKEN APPREHENSION
3853-163249-0015 HE IS TERRIBLE AND YET GLORIOUS
3853-163249-0016 DAVID HELD IT CLOSE IN BOTH OF HIS SAYING GRATEFULLY THANK YOU MOTHER THEN FIXING HIS EYES UPON THE YOUNGER YET NOT DEARER WOMEN HE ADDED WITH A RING IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THEIR HEARTS ANSWER WITH A PROMPT AY AY IN SPITE OF LOVE OR FEAR
3853-163249-0017 THE BOYS BLESSED THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE NOBLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE NEEDED NOW WE CANNOT SACRIFICE ALL THE GALLANT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN THEY MUST TAKE OUR TURN AND TRY TO DO AS WELL
3853-163249-0018 YES DAVID SISTER AND SWEETHEART ANSWERED BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FERVOR OF A MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD
3853-163249-0019 BENNETT WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND THE GREENHOUSE OFF MY HANDS THIS AUTUMN FOR A WEEK OR LONGER IF I LIKE
3853-163249-0020 HE'S A KIND NEIGHBORLY MAN AND HIS BOY WILL TAKE MY PLACE AROUND THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOU FAITHFULLY
3853-163249-0021 I KNEW YOU WOULD BE I SAW YOU GETTING READY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO FOLLOW
3853-163249-0022 YOU WILL LET ME DO IT AND IN RETURN I SHALL MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK ME ANSWERED CHRISTIE SEALING THE PROMISE WITH A KISS THAT SILENCED HIM
3853-163249-0023 YOU'VE SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SEE IT IN YOUR FACES DEAR I MUST GO
3853-163249-0024 NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STERLING SAT ALONE IN THE TWILIGHT A TALL MAN IN ARMY BLUE ENTERED QUIETLY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQUIL FIGURE FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KNELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH A MOST UNSOGERLY CHOKE IN THE VOICE
3853-163249-0025 THE LOYAL FRENZY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THE COUNTRY
3853-163249-0026 IT MUST HAVE TAKEN MANY KNAPSACKS TO HOLD ALL THE GIFTS SHOWERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
3853-163249-0027 FINDING THAT LYICIA SHOWED LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROUSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VARIOUS SORTS
3853-163249-0028 VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WILKINS RESOLUTELY TO HERSELF IF I CAN'T MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SOUL I WILL ON THIS STOMACH AND SEE HOW THAT'LL WORK
3853-163249-0029 WE CAN'T AFFORD NO NICE FIDDLES NOW WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERIN TOO
3853-163249-0030 HE WAS NOT AS UNMOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SUNDRY MANLY IMPULSES TO UP AND ATOM WHEN HIS COMRADES IN THE SHOP DISCUSSED THE CRISIS WITH IREFUL BRANDISHING OF AWLS AND VENGEFUL POUNDING OF SAW LEATHER AS IF THE REBELS WERE UNDER THE HAMMER
3853-163249-0031 TO SAY THAT THE FISH ROSE AT ONCE AND SWALLOWED THE BAIT HOOK AND ALL BUT FEEBLY EXPRESSES THE JUSTICE DONE TO THE CAKES BY THAT LONG SUFFERING MEN
3853-163249-0032 CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HEPSEY TOLD US AND CALL THEM POOR LONG SUFFERING CREATORS NAMES
3853-163249-0033 KNOW HE AIN'T IT'S A TRAINER ADDED ANNE LIZZIE
3853-163249-0034 NOW CYNTHIA IS YOU SATISFIED
3853-163249-0035 AND THE INCONSISTENT WOMAN FELL UPON HIS BUTCANY BREAST WEEPING COPIOUSLY
3853-163249-0036 HIS WIFE FED HIM WITH THE FAT OF THE LAND REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVOLVED ABOUT HIM WITH TIRELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLOCKED IN TO APPLAUD ADVISE AND ADMIRATION EVERY ONE TREATED HIM WITH THE RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCREASED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND BORE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
3853-163249-0037 THEN THIS GOOD SOUL OPENLY SHOULDERED THE BURDEN SHE HAD BORNE SO LONG IN SECRET AND BRAVELY TRUDGED ON ALONE
3853-163249-0038 THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WORK TO LOOK OR LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY INSTANT WAS PRECIOUS
3853-163249-0039 THAT KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT A WORD MISSUS STERLING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD
3853-163249-0040 NO LET'S BE BRAVE AND ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT
3853-163249-0041 WE WILL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU DAVY ASKED CHRISTIE WONDERFULLY COMFORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TOO
3853-163249-0042 AS A MARRIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEED YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED HERE FOR HE COULD NOT ADD SO MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PENSION TO SUPPORT YOU
3853-163249-0043 NOTHING CAN PART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR THE LOVE LIKE OURS WILL LAST FOR EVER
3853-163249-0044 NOT ONLY DAVID THAT'S TRUE LOVE CHRISTIE
3853-163249-0045 THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THAT SILENCE THE TWO HEARTS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TONGUE CAN UTTER
3853-163249-0046 SURELY I SHALL IF I GAVE YOU AND MYSELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNOW THAT MY HEART HAS GOT TO ACHE AS IT NEVER HAS ACHED YET WHEN MY COURAGE FAILS AS IT WILL BY AND BY AND MY SELFISH SOUL COUNTS THE COST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER
3853-163249-0047 DAVID CAUGHT THE EXULTATION AND GAVE NO FURTHER THOUGHT TO ANYTHING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER AND BRAVER FOR THE LONG LOOK INTO THE ILLUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
3853-163249-0048 THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMINDED ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BABY'S LITTLE COFFIN
3853-163249-0049 BUT I THINK FEW BRIDES DRESS WITH A BRAVER HAPPIER HEART THAN MINE THOUGH I DO CHOOSE A SOBER WEDDING GOWN ANSWERED CHRISTIE SMILING AGAIN AS SHE TOOK FROM A HALF PACKED TRUNK HER NEW SUIT OF SOFT GRAY WOOLLEN STUFF
3853-163249-0050 MISTER POWER IS WAITING ARE YOU READY LOVEL QUITE READY
3853-163249-0051 YOU YOUNG FOLKS TAKE A WEDDING TRIP TO THE GREEN HOUSE WHEN WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU
3853-163249-0052 DAVID AND CHRISTINE WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHED ANY TEARS OVER THE BRIEF HAPPINESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOYALLY KEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP IN THEIR TENDER HEARTS
3853-163249-0053 A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRIAGE FEAST BUT MORE LOVE GOOD WILL AND TENDER WISHES ADORNED THE PLAIN TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND AT WEDDING BREAKFASTS AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEECH OR SONG WAS LETTY'S BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS OVER DAVID'S EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESS AND KEEP AND BRING HIM BACK TO US
3853-163249-0054 THEY WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BREATH AND PROUD SOULS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW AND BRIGHT WITH A STEELY GLITTER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET IN A WAY TO JOIN THE SEA OF DAUNTLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND EBBED BACK REDDENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE
3853-163249-0055 THEN SHE SAW DAVID AND THE REGIMENT BECAME ONE DAY TO HER
3853-163249-0056 I COULD NOT LOVE THEE DEAR SO MUCH LOVE I NOT HONOR MORE
422-122949-0000 EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPEMAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND SO IT WILL ALWAYS BE A SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS AND REQUIRING SLAVERY IN SOME FORM OR OTHER
422-122949-0001 THE DISTINCTIONS OF MORAL VIRTUES HAVE EITHER ORIGINATED IN A RULING CASTE PLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS OF BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE RULED OR AMONG THE RULED CLASS THE SLAVES AND DEPENDENTS OF ALL SORTS
422-122949-0002 THE TRUTHFUL ONES THE NOBILITY IN ANCIENT GREECE CALLED THEMSELVES
422-122949-0003 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERYWHERE THE DESIGNATIONS OF MORAL VALUE WERE AT FIRST APPLIED TO MEN AND WERE ONLY DERIVATIVELY AND AT A LATER PERIOD APPLIED TO ACTIONS IT IS A GROSS MISTAKE THEREFORE WHEN HISTORIANS OF MORALS START WITH QUESTIONS LIKE WHY HAVE THE SYMPATHETIC ACTIONS BEEN PRAISED
422-122949-0004 HE HONOURS WHATEVER HE RECOGNIZES IN HIMSELF SUCH MORALITY EQUALS SELF GLORIFICATION AND
422-122949-0005 PROBABLY A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION WITH REGARD TO THE ENTIRE SITUATION OF MAN WILL FIND EXPRESSION PERHAPS A CONDEMNATION OF MAN TOGETHER WITH THE SITUATION
422-122949-0006 HERE WAS THE SEAT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS ANTITHESIS GOOD AND EVIL POWER AND DANGEROUSNESS ARE ASSUMED TO RESIDE IN THE EVIL A CERTAIN DREADFULNESS SUBTLETY AND STRENGTH WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF BEING DESPISED
422-122949-0007 ACCORDING TO SLAVE MORALITY THEREFORE THE EVIL MAN AROUSES FEAR ACCORDING TO MASTER MORALITY IT IS PRECISELY THE GOOD MAN WHO AROUSES FEAR AND SEEKS TO AROUSE IT WHILE THE BAD MAN IS REGARDED AS THAT DESPICABLE BEING
422-122949-0008 EVERYWHERE THE SLAVE MORALITY GAINS THE ASCENDENCY LANGUAGE SHOWS A TENDENCY TO APPROXIMATE THE SIGNIFICATIONS OF THE WORD GOOD AND STUPID
422-122949-0009 OR HE WILL EVEN SAY FOR MANY REASONS I CAN DELIGHT IN THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE I LOVE AND HONOUR THEM AND REJOICE IN ALL THEIR JOYS PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE THEIR GOOD OPINION INDORSES AND STRENGTHENS MY BELIEF IN MY OWN GOOD OPINION PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS EVEN IN CASES WHERE I DID NOT SHARE IT IS USEFUL TO ME OR GIVES PROMISE OF USEFULNESS ALL THIS HOWEVER IS NOT VANITY
422-122949-0010 IN FACT CONFORMABLY TO THE SLOW RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL ORDER AND ITS CAUSE THE BLENDING OF THE BLOOD OF MASTERS AND SLAVES THE ORIGINAL NOBLE AND RARE IMPULSE OF THE MASTERS TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO THEMSELVES AND TO THINK WELL OF THEMSELVES WILL NOW BE MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED AND EXTENDED BUT IT HAS AT ALL TIMES AN OLDER AMPLER AND MORE RADICALLY INGRAINED PROPENSITY OPPOSED TO IT AND IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF VANITY THIS OLDER PROPENSITY OVERMASTERS THE YOUNGER
422-122949-0011 A MOST VARIED EXPERIENCE TEACHES IT WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY OWES THE FACT THAT IT STILL EXISTS IN SPITE OF ALL GODS AND MEN AND HAS HITHERTO BEEN VICTORIOUS THESE QUALITIES IT CALLS VIRTUES AND THESE VIRTUES ALONE IT DEVELOPS TO MATURITY
422-122949-0012 VARIATIONS WHETHER THEY BE DEVIATIONS INTO THE HIGHER FINER AND RARER OR DETERIORATIONS AND MONSTROSITIES APPEAR SUDDENLY ON THE SCENE IN THE GREATEST EXUBERANCE AND SPLENDORS THE INDIVIDUAL DARES TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND DETACH HIMSELF
422-122949-0013 AT THIS TURNING POINT OF HISTORY THERE MANIFEST THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE AND OFTEN MIXED AND ENTANGLED TOGETHER A MAGNIFICENT MANIFOLD VIRGIN FOREST LIKE UPGROWTH AND UP STRIVING A KIND OF TROPICAL TEMPO IN THE RIVALRY OF GROWTH AND AN EXTRAORDINARY DECAY AND SELF DESTRUCTION OWING TO THE SAVAGELY OPPOSING AND SEEMINGLY EXPLODING EGOTISMS WHICH STRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR SUN AND LIGHT AND CAN NO LONGER ASSIGN ANY LIMIT RESTRAINT OR FORBEARANCE FOR THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF THE HITHERTO EXISTING MORALITY
422-122949-0014 NOTHING BUT NEW WORLDS NOTHING BUT NEW HOWS NO COMMON FORMULAS ANY LONGER MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISREGARD IN LEAGUE WITH EACH OTHER DECAY DETERIORATION AND THE LOFTIEST DESIRES FRIGHTFULLY ENTANGLED THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVERFLOWING FROM ALL THE CORNUCOPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD A PORTENTOUS SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF SPRING AND AUTUMN FULL OF NEW CHARMS AND MYSTERIES PECULIAR TO THE FRESH STILL EXHAUSTED STILL UNWEARIED CORRUPTION
422-122949-0015 DANGER IS AGAIN PRESENT THE MOTHER OF MORTALITY GREAT DANGER THIS TIME SHIFTED INTO THE INDIVIDUAL INTO THE NEIGHBOUR AND FRIEND INTO THE STREET INTO THEIR OWN CHILD INTO THEIR OWN HEART INTO ALL THE MOST PERSONAL AND SECRET RECESSES OF THEIR DESIRES AND VOLITIONS
422-122949-0016 WHAT WILL THE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS WHO APPEAR IN THIS TIME HAVE TO PREACH
422-122949-0017 THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF A RACE
422-122949-0018 IN OUR VERY DEMOCRATIC OR RATHER VERY PLEBEIAN AGE EDUCATION AND CULTURE MUST BE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF DECEIVING DECEIVING WITH REGARD TO ORNAMENT WITH REGARD TO THE INHERITED PLEBEIANISM IN BODY AND SOUL
422-122949-0019 THAT NOBLE SOUL ACCEPTS THE FACT OF HIS EGOISM WITHOUT QUESTION AND ALSO WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS OF HARSHNESS CONSTRAINT OR ARBITRARINESS THEREIN BUT RATHER AS SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE ITS BASIS IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF THINGS IF HE SOUGHT A DESIGNATION FOR IT HE WOULD SAY IT IS JUSTICE ITSELF
422-122949-0020 ON THIS ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE OF ONE NATION UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN THOSE BELONGING TO DIFFERENT NATIONS EVEN WHEN THEY USE THE SAME LANGUAGE OR RATHER WHEN PEOPLE HAVE LIVED LONG TOGETHER UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE SOIL DANGER REQUIREMENT TOIL THERE ORIGINATES THEREFROM A ENTITY THAT UNDERSTANDS ITSELF NAMELY A NATION
422-122949-0021 THE GREATER THE DANGER THE GREATER IS THE NEED OF AGREEING QUICKLY AND READILY ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY NOT TO MISUNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER IN ANGER THAT IS WHAT CANNOT AT ALL BE DISPENSED WITH IN INTERCOURSE
422-122949-0022 ALSO IN ALL LOVES AND FRIENDSHIPS ONE HAS THE EXPERIENCE THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND CONTINUES WHILE THE DISCOVERY HAS BEEN MADE THAT IN USING THE SAME WORDS ONE OF THE TWO PARTIES HAS FEELINGS THOUGHTS INTUITIONS WISHES OR FEARS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE OTHER
422-122949-0023 WHICHEVER GROUPS OF SENSATIONS WITHIN A SOUL AWAKEN MOST READILY BEGIN TO SPEAK AND GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND THESE DECIDE AS TO THE GENERAL ORDER OF RANKS OF ITS VALUES AND DETERMINE ULTIMATELY ITS LIST OF DESIRABLE THINGS
422-122949-0024 A MAN'S ESTIMATES OF VALUE BETRAY SOMETHING OF THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SOUL AND WHEREIN IT RECEIVES ITS CONDITIONS OF LIFE ITS INTRINSIC NEEDS
422-122949-0025 PROFOUND SUFFERING MAKES NOBLE IT SEPARATES ONE OF THE MOST REFINED FORMS OF DISEASE IS EPICURISM ALONG WITH A CERTAIN OSTENTATIOUS BOLDNESS OF TASTE WHICH TAKES SUFFERING LIGHTLY AND PUTS ITSELF ON THE DEFENSIVE AGAINST ALL THAT IS SORROWFUL AND PROFOUND
422-122949-0026 THE HIGHEST INSTINCT FOR PURITY PLACES HIM WHO IS AFFECTED BY IT IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND DANGEROUS ISOLATION AS A SAINT FOR IT IS JUST HOLINESS THE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE INSTINCT IN QUESTION
422-122949-0027 OCCASIONALLY TOO THE WAKING CALL COMES TOO LATE THE CHANCE WHICH GIVES PERMISSION TO TAKE ACTION WHERE THEIR BEST YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR ACTION HAVE BEEN USED UP IN SITTING STILL AND HOW MANY A ONE JUST AS HE SPRANG UP HAS FOUND WITH HORROR THAT HIS LIMBS ARE BENUMBED AND HIS SPIRITS ARE NOW TOO HEAVY
422-122949-0028 AND WHOEVER THOU ART WHICH IS IT THAT NOW PLEASES THEE
422-122949-0029 ONLY NAME IT OTHERWISE I HAVE I OFFER THEE
422-122949-0030 BUT YOU MISUNDERSTAND HIM WHEN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT ME
422-122949-0031 THERE MUST BE A SORT OF REPUGNANCE IN ME TO BELIEVE ANYTHING DEFINITE ABOUT HIMSELF IS THERE PERHAPS SOME ENIGMA THEREIN
422-122949-0032 PROBABLY BUT FORTUNATELY NOTHING FOR MY OWN TEETH PERHAPS IT BETRAYS THE SPECIES TO WHICH I BELONG BUT NOT TO MYSELF AS IT IS SUFFICIENTLY AGREEABLE TO ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
422-122949-0033 I DO NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY PERHAPS THE HARPIES HAVE FLOWN OVER MY CHAMBER
422-122949-0034 TO SUFFOCATE WITH HIS MEMORIES TO HIM WHO HAS THE DESIRES OF A LOFTY AND DAINTY SOUL AND ONLY SELDOM FINDS HIS TABLE LAID AND HIS FOOD PREPARED THE WONDER WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT NOWADAYS HOWEVER IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY SO
422-122949-0035 AND TO CHOOSE FOR COMPANY THAT ROGUISH AND CHEERFUL DEVICE POLITENESS
5338-24615-0000 IT WAS ABOUT NOON WHEN CAPTAIN WAVERLEY ENTERED THE STRAGGLING VILLAGE OR RATHER HAMLET OF TULEY VEELLON CLOSE TO WHICH WAS SITUATED THE MANSION OF THE PROPRIETOR
5338-24615-0001 THE HOUSES STOOD MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME ESPECIALLY TO AN EYE ACCUSTOMED TO THE SMILING NEATNESS OF ENGLISH COTTAGES
5338-24615-0002 OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHEN SUCH A CONSUMMATION SEEMED INEVITABLE A WATCHFUL OLD GRANDAM WITH HER CLOSE CUFF DISTAFF AND SPINDLE RUSHED LIKE A SYBIL IN FRENZY OUT OF ONE OF THESE MISERABLE CELLS DASHED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH AND SNATCHING UP HER OWN CHARGE FROM AMONG THE SUNBURNT LOITERERS SALUTED HIM WITH A SOUND CUFF AND TRANSPORTED HIM BACK TO HIS DUNGEON THE LITTLE WHITE HEADED VARLET SCREAMING ALL THE WHILE FROM THE VERY TOP OF HIS LUNGS A SHRILLY TREBLE TO THE GROWLING REMONSTRANCES OF THE ENRAGED MATRON
5338-24615-0003 THE EVIL AND REMEDY SUCH AS IT IS STILL EXISTS BUT THIS IS REMOTE FROM OUR PRESENT PURPOSE AND IS ONLY THROWN OUT FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE COLLECTORS UNDER MISTER DENT'S DOGMILL
5338-24615-0004 YET THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED WAS FAR FROM EXHIBITING THE INDIFFERENCE OF STUPIDITY THEIR FEATURES WERE ROUGH BUT REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT GRAVE BUT THE VERY REVERSE OF STUPID AND FROM AMONG THE YOUNG WOMEN AN ARTIST MIGHT HAVE SPOKEN MORE THAN ONE MODEL WHOSE FEATURES AND FORM RESEMBLED THOSE OF MINERVA
5338-24615-0005 THIS AVENUE WAS STRAIGHT AND OF MODERATE LENGTH RUNNING BETWEEN A DOUBLE ROW OF VERY ANCIENT HORSE CHESTNUTS PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH SYCAMORES WHICH ROSE TO SUCH HUGE HEIGHTS AND NOURISHED SO LUXURIANTLY THAT THEIR BOUGHS COMPLETELY OVERARCHED THE BROAD ROAD BEYOND
5338-24615-0006 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFECTS WHICH A PAINTER LOVES TO REPRESENT AND MINGLED WELL WITH THE STRUGGLING LIGHT WHICH FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE BOUGHS OF THE SHADY ARK THAT VAULTED THE BROAD GREEN ALLEYS
5338-24615-0007 THE HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO CONSIST OF TWO OR THREE HIGH NARROW AND STEEP ROOFED BUILDINGS PROJECTING FROM EACH OTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES FORMED ONE PART OF THE ENCLOSURE
5338-24615-0008 IT HAD BEEN BUILT AT A PERIOD WHEN CASTLES WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY AND WHEN THE SCOTTISH ARCHITECTS HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED THE ARTS OF DESIGNING A DOMESTIC RESIDENCE
5338-24615-0009 NEITHER DID THE FRONT INDICATE ABSOLUTELY SECURITY FROM DANGER
5338-24615-0010 STABLES AND OTHER OFFICES OCCUPIED ANOTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARES
5338-24615-0011 TWO BATTLEMENTED WALLS ONE OF WHICH FACED THE AVENUE AND THE OTHER DIVIDED THE COURT FROM THE GARDENS COMPLETED THE ENCLOSURE
5338-24615-0012 AND THIS WORK OF ART WAS THE WONDER OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND
5338-24615-0013 THE COURT WAS SPACIOUS WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE STABLES OF REMOVING THE LITTER
5338-24615-0014 EVERYTHING AROUND APPEARED SOLITARY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENCE BUT FOR THE CONTINUED PLASHING OF THE FOUNTAIN AND THE WHOLE SCENE STILL MAINTAINED THE MONASTIC ILLUSION WHICH THE FANCY OF WAVERLEY HAD CONJURED UP
5338-24640-0000 CHAPTER FIFTY THREE A CONFIDANT
5338-24640-0001 MISTER MORTON REPLIED THAT THOUGH FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAIM UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESERVING IT
5338-24640-0002 EVIL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER MORTON OR WHO HOLDS CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND CEREMONIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE GAUGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH OR MORAL VIRTUES
5338-24640-0003 MISTER CORTON SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAVERLEY'S VISIT TO DONALD BEAN LEAN
5338-24640-0004 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WAVERLEY ANY SUCH HAIR BRAINED EXPEDITION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION SHOULD HAVE HAD INEXPRESSIBLE CHARMS FOR ME
5338-24640-0005 HE CERTAINLY POSSESSES TALENTS BEYOND THE RUDE SPHERES IN WHICH HE MOVES AND BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR ENCUMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS
5338-24640-0006 MISTER MORTON THEN MADE A CAREFUL MEMORANDUM OF THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAVERLEY'S INTERVIEW WITH DONALD BEN LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED
5338-24640-0007 HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NOR WITH MY WRETCHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPICIONS AND HIS INFERENCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE RACKS OF A INQUISITION
5338-24640-0008 THEY HELD CONVENTICLES ON THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK ARMS DURING THOSE REIGNS
5338-24640-0009 SINCE THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DIMINISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES AND SEVERAL WITH THE BETTER TEMPER THAN IN SEVENTEEN O SEVEN HAVE NOW TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERNMENT
5338-284437-0000 IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BUT EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE
5338-284437-0001 HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IT IS THE PALACE OF TOURMALINE WHO IS OUR QUEEN
5338-284437-0002 BUT THAT LITTLE CABIN
5338-284437-0003 EXCLAIMED TROT OF HORSE
5338-284437-0004 DID YOU SUPPOSE THIS PALACE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED
5338-284437-0005 THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REPLIED A MAN IN THE CROWD
5338-284437-0006 THEY SEEM VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID OTHER IN REPLY
5338-284437-0007 THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACES
5338-284437-0008 SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARNING A PAIR OF STOCKINGS
5338-284437-0009 SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY
5338-284437-0010 HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF CHARLOTTE'S SKIN
5338-284437-0011 WHAT IS IT CORALY SHE ASKED THE WOMAN
5338-284437-0012 THE QUEEN GAZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH APPARENT INTEREST
5338-284437-0013 SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE OF BUTTON BRIGHT'S OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAP'N BILL WERE SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE
5338-284437-0014 ARE YOU A DIAMOND
5338-284437-0015 PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDICULE ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE ELDER'S FACE CLOSELY
5338-284437-0016 THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW WELL
5338-284437-0017 CORILLA DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING A QUEEN
5338-284437-0018 EVEN IN AMERICA EVERYBODY BOWS LOW TO OUR PRESIDENT AND THE BLUESKINS ARE SO FRAID OF THEIR BOOLOOROO THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GET NEAR HIM
5338-284437-0019 BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TOURMALINE BRAVELY
5338-284437-0020 THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECT
5338-284437-0021 IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THEY IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE
5338-284437-0022 IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINKS WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE
5338-284437-0023 NO THEIR WAY IS BEST
5338-284437-0024 THE QUEEN HAVE NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ADJUST GRIEVANCES AND TO COMPEL ORDER
5338-284437-0025 I HAVE ONE GREAT PURPOSE
5338-284437-0026 AFTER MY DEATH THE PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUTES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKIES IN AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOUR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD
5338-284437-0027 A MISFORTUNE OF BIRTH RAISED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FATE
5338-284437-0028 IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FREELY
5338-284437-0029 YES IT WAS WET AND STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILOR BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AND WE GOT THERE ALL RIGHT
5338-284437-0030 WE ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY
5338-284437-0031 IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS WHO HAVE EVER STEPPED A FOOT INTO OUR LAND
5338-284437-0032 WE DO NOT HATE YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLUESKINS DO NOR ARE WE SAVAGE OR CRUEL BUT WE DID NOT WANT YOU HERE AND I AM REALLY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU
5338-284437-0033 I'LL LOOK ON THE GREAT BOOK FIRST
5536-43358-0000 THIS SAVAGE PHILOSOPHER THE DUAL MIND
5536-43358-0001 THE ORIGINAL ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN UNION TOWARD THE ETERNAL THE GREAT MYSTERY THAT SURROUNDS AND EMBRACES US WAS AS SIMPLE AS IT WAS EXALTED
5536-43358-0002 IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE ALL SPEECH IS OF NECESSITY FEEBLE AND IMPERFECT THEREFORE THE SONGS OF MY ANCESTORS ASCEND TO GOD IN WORDLESS ADORATION
5536-43358-0003 NONE MIGHT EXHORT OR CONFESS NOR IN ANY WAY MEDDLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF ANOTHER
5536-43358-0004 AMONG US ALL MANY WERE CREATED SONS OF GOD AND STOOD ERECT AS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DIVINITY
5536-43358-0005 THAT SOLITARY COMMUNION WITH THE UNSEEN WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF OUR RELIGIOUS LIFE IS PARTLY DESCRIBED IN THE WORD BAMBEDE LITERALLY MYSTERIOUS FEELING WHICH HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY TRANSLATED FASTING AND DREAMING
5536-43358-0006 THE FIRST BAMBIE OR RELIGIOUS RETREAT MARKED AN EPOCH IN THE LIFE OF THE YOUTH WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF CONFIRMATION OR CONVERSION IN THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE
5536-43358-0007 KNOWING THAT GOD SETS NO VALUE UPON MATERIAL THINGS HE TOOK WITH HIM NO OFFERINGS OF SACRIFICES OTHER THAN SYMBOLIC OBJECTS SUCH AS PAINTS AND TOBACCO
5536-43358-0008 AT THE SOLEMN HOUR OF SUNRISE OR SUNSET HE TOOK UP HIS POSITION OVERLOOKING THE GLORIES OF EARTH AND FACING THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THERE HE REMAINED NAKED ERECT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND FORCES OF ITS ARMING FOR A NIGHT AND A DAY TO TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT RARELY LONGER
5536-43358-0009 WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE CAMP HE MUST REMAIN AT A DISTANCE UNTIL HE HAD AGAIN ENTERED THAT VAPOR BATH AND PREPARED HIMSELF FOR INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOWS
5536-43358-0010 IT WAS NOT THEN WHOLLY FROM IGNORANCE OR IMPROVIDENCE THAT WE FAILED TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT TOWNS AND TO DEVELOP A MATERIAL CIVILIZATION
5536-43358-0011 TO THE UNTUTORED SAGE THE CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION WAS THIS PROLIFIC MOTHER OF ALL EVILS MORAL NO LESS THAN PHYSICAL
5536-43358-0012 IN THIS TYPE OF PRAYER THERE WAS NO BESEECHING OF FAVOUR OR HOPE
5536-43358-0013 FROM THE SUN AS THE UNIVERSAL FATHER PROCEEDS THE QUICKENING PRINCIPLE IN NATURE AND IN THE PATIENT AND FRUITFUL WOMB OF OUR MOTHER THE EARTH ARE HIDDEN EMBRYOS OF PLANETS AND MEN
5536-43358-0014 THIS IS THE MATERIAL OR PHYSICAL BRAIN
5536-43358-0015 NOTHING OF THE MARVELLOUS WOULD ASTONISH HIM AS THAT A BEAST SHOULD SPEAK OR THE SUN STAND STILL
5536-43358-0016 WHO MAY DENY HIS SUPERSTITION
5536-43358-0017 HERE IS THE SUPREME MYSTERY THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WORSHIP WITHOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO RELIGIOUS AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS MYSTERY OUR ATTITUDE CANNOT BE VERY UNLIKE THAT OF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WHO BEHOLDS WITH AWE THE DIVINE IN ALL CREATION
5536-43358-0018 IN HIS OWN THOUGHT HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM HE SCORNED THEM EVEN AS THE LOFTY SPIRIT ABSORBED IN ITS STERN TASK REJECTS THE SOFT BEDS THE LUXURIOUS FOOD THE PLEASURE WORSHIPPING DALLIANCE OF A RICH NEIGHBOR
5536-43358-0019 THE HISTORIANS OF A WHITE RACE ADMIT THAT THE INDIAN WAS NEVER THE FIRST TO REPUDIATE HIS OATH
5536-43359-0000 HE HAD NEITHER A NATIONAL BODY NOR AN ORGANIZED CHURCH
5536-43359-0001 HER ATTITUDE AND SECRET MEDITATIONS MUST BE SUCH AS TO INSTILL INTO THE RECEPTIVE SOUL OF THE UNBORN CHILD THE LOVE OF THAT GREAT MYSTERY AND A SENSE OF BROTHERHOOD WITH ALL CREATION
5536-43359-0002 THE ORDEAL IS BEST MET ALONE WHERE NO CURIOUS OR PITYING EYES EMBARRASS HER WHILE ALL NATURE SAYS TO HER SPIRIT TIS LOVE TIS LOVE THE FULFILLING OF LIFE
5536-43359-0003 THIS WILD MOTHER HAS NOT ONLY THE EXPERIENCE OF HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND THE ACCEPTED RULES OF HER PEOPLE FOR HER GUIDE BUT SHE HUMBLY SEEKS TO LEARN A LESSON FROM ANTS BEES SPIDERS BEAVERS AND BADGERS
5536-43359-0004 IN DUE TIME THE CHILD TAKES OF HIS OWN ACCORD THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AND SPEAKS REVERENTLY OF THE FACTS
5536-43359-0005 INDEED THE DISTINCTIVE WORK OF BOTH GRANDPARENTS IS THAT OF ACQUAINTING THEIR YOUTH WITH THE NATIONAL TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS
5536-43359-0006 THE FAMILY WAS NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL UNIT BUT ALSO THE UNIT OF THE GOVERNMENT
5536-43359-0007 THE REMOTER DEGREES OF KINSHIP WERE FULLY RECOGNISED AND THAT NOT AS A MATTER OF FORM ONLY FIRST COUSINS WERE KNOWN AS BROTHER AND SISTERS THE NAME OF COUSIN CONSTITUTED A BINDING CLAIM AND A RIGID MORALITY FORBADE MARRIAGE BETWEEN COUSINS IN ANY KNOWN DEGREE OR IN OTHER WORDS WITHIN THE CLAN
5536-43359-0008 WHEN SHE FELL THE WHOLE PLACE FELL WITH HER
5536-43359-0009 BEFORE THIS CALAMITY CAME UPON US HE COULD NOT FIND ANYWHERE A HAPPIER HOME THAN THAT CREATED BY THE INDIAN WOMAN
5536-43359-0010 HIS DAILY FORTUNES WERE MORE NECESSARY TO HIM THAN DAILY FOOD
5536-43359-0011 WHENEVER IN THE COURSE OF THE DAILY HUNT THE RED HUNTER COMES UPON A SCENE THAT IS STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL OR SUBLIME A BLACK THUNDERCLOUD WITH THE RAINBOW'S GLOWING ARCH ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN A WHITE WATERFALL IN THE HEART OF A GREEN GORGE A VAST PRAIRIE TINGED WITH THE BLOOD RED OF SUNSET HE PAUSES FOR AN INSTANT IN THE ATTITUDE OF WORSHIP
5536-43359-0012 WHEN HE BECOMES AN OLD MAN HE LOVES TO MAKE A NOTABLE EFFORT TO PROVE THIS GRATITUDE
5536-43359-0013 HE PUTS OFF THE CHOICEST MORSEL OF THE MEAT AND CASTS IT INTO THE FIRE THE PUREST AND MOST ETHEREAL ELEMENT
5536-43359-0014 THE HOSPITALITY OF THE WIGWAM IS ONLY LIMITED BY THE INSTITUTION OF WARS
5536-43359-0015 OUR HONOR IS THE GUARANTEE FOR HER SAFETY SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE CAMP
5536-43359-0016 LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN IS FOUNDED ON THE MATING INSTINCTS AND IS NOT FREE FROM DESIRE AND SELF SEEKING
5536-43359-0017 BUT TO HAVE A WORD AND TO BE TRUE UNDER ANY AND ALL TRIALS IS THE MARK OF A MAN
5536-43359-0018 THIS BOND IS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IS ACTUALLY FORMED IN EARLY YOUTH AND CAN ONLY BE BROKEN BY DEATH
5536-43363-0000 REINCARNATION AND THE CONGRESS OF SPIRITS
5536-43363-0001 HOWEVER HE COURTS DEATH IN BATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD REGARD IT AS DISGRACEFUL TO BE KILLED IN A PRIVATE QUARREL
5536-43363-0002 THE MEN BLACKEN THE FACES AND WIDOWS OR BEREAVED PARENTS SOMETIMES GASH THEIR ARMS AND LEGS TILL THEY ARE COVERED WITH BLOOD
5536-43363-0003 GIVING THEMSELVES UP FULLY TO THEIR GRIEF THEY ARE NO LONGER CONCERNED ABOUT ANY EARTHLY POSSESSION AND OFTEN GIVE AWAY ALL THAT THEY HAVE TO THE FIRST COMERS EVEN TO THEIR BEDS AND THEIR HOME
5536-43363-0004 IT WAS PREPARED BY DRESSING IN THE FINEST CLOTHES TOGETHER WITH SOME PERSONAL POSSESSIONS AND ORNAMENTS WRAPPED IN SEVERAL ROBES AND FINDING IN A SECURE COVERING OF RAWHIDE
5536-43363-0005 AS A SPECIAL MARK OF RESPECT THE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN OR A WARRIOR WAS SOMETIMES LAID OUT IN STATE IN A NEW TEEPEE WITH THE USUAL HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES AND EVEN WITH A DISH OF FOOD LEFT BEHIND IT NOT THAT THEY SUPPOSED THE SPIRIT COULD USE THE IMPLEMENTS OR EAT THE FOOD BUT MERELY AS A LAST TRIBUTE
5536-43363-0006 IF A MAN WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE IT WAS AN OLD CUSTOM TO PLACE HIS BODY AGAINST A TREE OR ROCK IN A SITTING POSITION ALWAYS FACING THE ENEMY TO INDICATE HIS UNDAUNTED DEFIANCE WITH BRAVERY EVEN IN DEATH
5536-43363-0007 AT EVERY MEAL TIME A DISH OF FOOD WAS PLACED UNDER IT AND SOME PERSON OF THE SAME SEX AND AGE AS THE ONE WHO WAS GONE MUST THEREFORE BE INVITED IN TO PARTAKE OF THE FOOD
5536-43363-0008 AT THE END OF A YEAR FROM THE TIME OF DEATH THE RELATIVES MADE THE PUBLIC FEAST AND GAVE AWAY THE CLOTHING AND OTHER GIFTS WHILE THE LOCK OF HAIR WAS INTERRED WITH APPROPRIATE CEREMONIES
5536-43363-0009 IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED OCCULT POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THEIR LATTER DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IMPOSTORS AND ALLOWING FOR THE VANITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL ATTESTED INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE PROPHECIES AND OTHER MYSTIC PRACTICE
5536-43363-0010 NO DOUBT MANY PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN COLORED TO SUIT THE NEW AGE AND UNQUESTIONABLY FALSE PROPHETS FAKIRS AND CONJURERS HAD BECOME THE PESTS OF THE TRIBES DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD
5536-43363-0011 THIS WERE CARRIED OUT TO THE LETTER
5536-43363-0012 THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF THEIR REMARKABLE PROPHECIES
5536-43363-0013 ANOTHER FAMOUS MEDICINE MAN WAS BORN ON THE RUM RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS AGO AND LIVED TO BE OVER A CENTURY OLD
5536-43363-0014 AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS HE SAVED THIS BAND FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL ENEMIES BY SUDDENLY GIVING WARNING RECEIVED IN A DREAM OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY
5536-43363-0015 FIVE YEARS LATER HE REPEATED THE SERVICE AND AGAIN SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM POSSIBLE SLAUGHTER
5536-43363-0016 THERE ARE MANY TRUSTWORTHY MEN AND MEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH TO VOUCH FOR THOSE AND SIMILAR EVENTS OCCURRING AS FORETOLD
5536-43363-0017 AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD JUST LEFT FORT ELLIS ON THE ASSINAUBON RIVER AND MY YOUNGEST UNCLE HAD SELECTED A FINE SPOT FOR OUR NIGHT CAMP
5536-43363-0018 MANY OF THE INDIANS BELIEVED THAT ONE CAN BE BORN MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF A FORMER INCARNATION
5536-43363-0019 HERE WAS A WELL KNOWN SIOUX WAR PROPHET WHO LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBERED BY THE OLD MEN OF HIS BAND
5694-64025-0000 SHILOH HE
5694-64025-0001 THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BATTLE IN WHICH A REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED
5694-64025-0002 I DO NOT PRETEND TO TELL OF WHAT COMMAND DISTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEROES OF BLOOD AND WOUNDS OF SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANNONS CAPTURED ET CETERA
5694-64025-0003 ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHALMERS BRIGADE RELIEVED CAPTAINS
5694-64025-0004 AS GLADDON RODE BY US A COURIER RODE UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING
5694-64025-0005 ON SUNDAY MORNING OF CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
5694-64025-0006 WE WERE DISAPPOINTING AN ALABAMA BRIGADE
5694-64025-0007 THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESSEE TO GIVE EM HAIL COLUMBIA
5694-64025-0008 THE FACT WAS KEPT THROUGH THE TROOPS
5694-64025-0009 YOU HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROOPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY
5694-64025-0010 I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLE FIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANNON AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLE TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALISED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
5694-64025-0011 I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THE ORDER TO CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT SORRY
5694-64025-0012 OTHERS COULD NOT CURB THE MEN TO KEEP IN LINE
5694-64025-0013 ON MONDAY THE GUIDE WAS REVERSED
5694-64025-0014 BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN AUTOMATON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CHRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVENTS WHICH CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
5694-64025-0015 SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BODY I REFER YOU TO HISTORY
5694-64025-0016 BY THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLOPED OFF DRAGGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFEDERATE LINES
5694-64025-0017 ON MONDAY MORNING I TOO YOU CAPTURED ME A MULE
5694-64025-0018 HE WAS ALWAYS IN HIS OWN CONCEIT
5694-64025-0019 I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MULE AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS N
5694-64025-0020 MULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND A TWISTING ON HIS NOSE
5694-64025-0021 SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROPE TIED ONE END AROUND THE MULE'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CASSON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHIP UP
5694-64025-0022 THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULE'S NAIL AND HE WAS FINALLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE TO CROSS THE CREEK
5694-64025-0023 ON MY TAKING THE ROPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMS TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOLKS BUT YOU ARE A LEETLE TOO SMART
5694-64029-0000 WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THEIR TRAMP AGAIN
5694-64029-0001 THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHVILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE UNION
5694-64029-0002 OUR COMPANY STOPPED AT MURFREESBORO
5694-64029-0003 FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIONS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY
5694-64029-0004 THE YANKEE PICKET LINES WERE ONLY A HALF MILE OFF
5694-64029-0005 I AM A VIDETTE AND YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
5694-64029-0006 SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SECESSIE ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY
5694-64029-0007 I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE WOLF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
5694-64029-0008 MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND I STEP WOULD GET IT
5694-64029-0009 I DID A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GUN
5694-64029-0010 HE DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BELL MISSED ITS AIM
5694-64029-0011 I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OPEN FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
5694-64029-0012 WE KEEP FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
5694-64029-0013 LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF THE STONES RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE
5694-64029-0014 BAD GENERALISM I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
5694-64029-0015 THE POET COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
5694-64029-0016 I CALLED LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIARSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THEM MIGHTY QUICK
5694-64029-0017 THE YANKEES MARCHING OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
5694-64029-0018 WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD THE ATTACK
5694-64029-0019 WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILKYSON TURNPIKE
5694-64029-0020 WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON OUR OWN MEN
5694-64029-0021 OAKLY COLOUR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE YANKEE LINE WITH HIS COLOURS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
5694-64029-0022 THE LEADEN HAILSTORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND REARED
5694-64029-0023 WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEATHAM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME OUT
5694-64029-0024 I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING TO GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
5694-64029-0025 I SAW IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER
5694-64029-0026 AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING
5694-64029-0027 I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND THEN I SAID GREAT GOD
5694-64029-0028 I WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN
5694-64029-0029 FOR I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES
5694-64029-0030 HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROVE THAT FOOT QUICK
5694-64029-0031 BEFORE WE ARRIVED IN THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
5694-64029-0032 OUR PICKETTS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED A NIGHT ATTACK
5694-64038-0000 AN ADVANCE INTO TENNESSEE
5694-64038-0001 YANK SAYS WHAT IS YOU DOING JOHNNY
5694-64038-0002 WE PASSED AROUND ATLANTA CROSSED THE CHATTAHOOCHEE AND TRAVELLED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE UPON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSON
5694-64038-0003 OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCES OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY
5694-64038-0004 WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAYBE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVENTY UP
5694-64038-0005 HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HELLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOS
5694-64038-0006 A YANKEE ALWAYS SAYS MAGGER
5694-64038-0007 THEY PERSUADEED ELOQUENTLY
5694-64038-0008 A MAN IS THE WELL
5694-64038-0009 THE VOICE SEEMS TO BE OVERHEAD
5694-64038-0010 RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARDS THE COMMON CENTRE AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT
5694-64038-0011 BUT HOW TO GET ME OUT WAS THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM
5694-64038-0012 THE POOR FELLOW'S STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT
5694-64038-0013 WE LOOKED ALL OVER AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR
5694-64038-0014 I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THAT BALL WHISTLE
5694-64038-0015 WE CROSSED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE OF TENNESSEE RIVER
5694-64038-0016 WE HAD BEEF FOR A SUPPER THAT NIGHT
5694-64038-0017 HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARDS THAT LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
5694-64038-0018 WE WERE INURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE AND EVERY SKIRMISH AND EVERY ADVANCE AND EVERY RETREAT AND EVERY VICTORY AND EVERY DEFEAT
5694-64038-0019 HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES THAT WAS NO GO
5694-64038-0020 BUT AFTER A WHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMAN AY GANNY THE LAW
5694-64038-0021 YOU KNOW JIM KNOWED THE LAW
5694-64038-0022 THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY OF THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
5694-64038-0023 THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAVE TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURFREESBORO PIKE
5694-64038-0024 ONE REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM'S REGIMENT
5694-64038-0025 HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME AND THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
5895-34615-0000 BUT IS LAUGHTER A SYNONYM OF CHOICE
5895-34615-0001 SUCH PERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN THE NATURE
5895-34615-0002 HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NO
5895-34615-0003 ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULATORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS PLACE
5895-34615-0004 IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELLED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITHOUT PREMEDITATION
5895-34615-0005 GWYNPLAINE WAS HIS MOUNTEBANK
5895-34615-0006 HE SHOWED HERSELF ON THE PLATFORM
5895-34615-0007 IT WAS GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGH OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF
5895-34615-0008 THE ACCIDENT DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIOR
5895-34615-0009 NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM ITS RECTUS
5895-34615-0010 ALL THESE EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGGRAVATED IT
5895-34615-0011 HIS EVERLASTING LAUGH
5895-34615-0012 THE MANICHEANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR THE TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL
5895-34615-0013 THE WHOLE OF BUSINESS RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT
5895-34615-0014 WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WAS EVER SOUNDING
5895-34615-0015 THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAID HE SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY
5895-34615-0016 BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE DAYS MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENTS TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANAESTHESIA
5895-34615-0017 BESIDES THIS FOE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GYMNAST AND AN ATHLETE
5895-34615-0018 GWYNPLAINE HAD YELLOW FACE
5895-34615-0019 ITS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DYED WITH SOME CORROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH
5895-34615-0020 ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MANE THAN A HEAD OF HAIR CARRIED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT
5895-34615-0021 THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAS BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD
5895-34622-0000 WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD OF STORIES
5895-34622-0001 THE GWYNPLAINE'S EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE
5895-34622-0002 WHAT WAS THIS MONEY
5895-34622-0003 FROM SIXTEEN FIFTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
5895-34622-0004 THE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGONS
5895-34622-0005 THAT GREEN COLOUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
5895-34622-0006 ON THE ROOF FROM A TUBE PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST THE SMOKE AROSE
5895-34622-0007 THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS SCHEME WAS OVERWHELMING
5895-34622-0008 THIS WAS THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATER
5895-34622-0009 UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEYOND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT
5895-34622-0010 THE EFFECT OF HIS AFFAIRS HAD BEEN SURPRISING
5895-34622-0011 SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF PHARISEES AND FETES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0012 THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PERSON EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
5895-34622-0013 THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE A CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATER AND TO SEW SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS
5895-34622-0014 FOR THESE READ PHOEBA AND VENUS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
5895-34622-0015 PHOEBU COOKED VENUS GRUB THE TEMPLE
5895-34622-0016 URSUS AND HUMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0017 THIS HUT ON A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BEDCHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0018 THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTED FROM EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0019 ALOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF DELIGHT
5895-34622-0020 URSUS WAS THE POET OF WHOSE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES
5895-34622-0021 THEN I AM PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
5895-34622-0022 THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITINERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT IN HORROR
5895-34622-0023 URSUS WAS IN EVERYBODY IN THE PEACE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA
5895-34629-0000 IT WAS ESTABLISHED ON SOUTHWARK
5895-34629-0001 THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHT TO URSIUS
5895-34629-0002 SAINT PAUL HAS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
5895-34629-0003 HE OPENED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTIST'S DOOR
5895-34629-0004 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREY BOX
5895-34629-0005 IT WAS A THEATER MADE
5895-34629-0006 AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAG INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
5895-34629-0007 THE PLACARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO A SIGN OF THE INN
5895-34629-0008 BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFFHAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES PHOEBE AND SOMETIMES LINOS
5895-34629-0009 WE ARE AT LONDON SAID URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY
5895-34629-0010 THEY GET THEIR PERFORMANCES
5895-34629-0011 WITH THAT PERCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTEBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL
5895-34629-0012 ALL SOUTHWARK RAN IN CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING BAND
5895-34629-0013 THE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNTEBANKS OF TARINEZO FIELD WERE AGHAST AT GWYNPLAINE
5895-34629-0014 GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THAT PUBLIC
5895-34629-0015 BESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWARDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE UPON THE GREEN
5895-34629-0016 EVEN HIS COMEDIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
5895-34629-0017 THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED DOUBTFUL
5895-34629-0018 IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAKESPERE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
5895-34629-0019 THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT LEFT LONDON BRIDGE
5895-34629-0020 THESE WITH REMARKABLE TALENTS
5895-34629-0021 BESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDING SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
5895-34629-0022 URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARK BUT BY NO MEANS
5895-34629-0023 AFTER EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
5895-34629-0024 THE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASED THEIR SUCCESS
5895-34629-0025 THIS CONNOISSEUR WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND I ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN
5895-34629-0026 HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING AND WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO ACCLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
5895-34629-0027 WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOT SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS
5895-34629-0028 HIS ENTHUSIASMS CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM
5895-34629-0029 THEY HAD A REAL FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
5895-34629-0030 ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NICLAS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
5895-34629-0031 WHAT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A POET
5895-34629-0032 HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SCOUT
5895-34629-0033 AT THAT HOUR THERE IS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
6241-61943-0000 ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP WALKARY
6241-61943-0001 BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE MEN ARE APT TO SUFFER
6241-61943-0002 WELL AND WE A FAIR WIND
6241-61943-0003 MY UNCLE IS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOODY AND DISSATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GHOST OF HAMLET
6241-61943-0004 BUT NO GOLD OR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
6241-61943-0005 THE FACT IS THE CASTLE WAS MUCH EARLIER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROIC PRINCE OF DENMARK
6241-61943-0006 NO MISTER HARDWIGGE SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
6241-61943-0007 AT ALL EVENTS YOU SHALL GET THERE SOME DAY
6241-61943-0008 ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNT MARGREL'S YOKEL WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
6241-61943-0009 THE VULGARY KEPT OFF THE COAST STEERING TO THE WESTWARD
6241-61943-0010 ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN OLD SCHOOLS OF WHALES AND SHARKS
6241-61943-0011 NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US OUT
6241-61943-0012 THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT SOME GOODS BY THE PERIODICAL VESSEL
6241-61943-0013 AND THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US
6241-61943-0014 HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BARON AND TRAMP
6241-61943-0015 THE PROPHET KNEW WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
6241-61943-0016 THIS MODEST SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELANDIC LATIN
6241-61943-0017 WHERE THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
6241-61943-0018 NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS I GOES WELL THE WORST DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER
6241-61943-0019 IN THE MORNING THERE IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE
6241-61943-0020 VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SAKNUSS
6241-61943-0021 AND I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSULT THEM
6241-61943-0022 THEY WERE NEVER HOWEVER ABSENT ON DUTY
6241-61943-0023 THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE HELD FOR CENTURIES
6241-61943-0024 I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT ON HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE PASTOR AND CONGREGATION
6241-61943-0025 THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS ON A ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY
6241-61943-0026 I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DRYING SALTING AND ROASTING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
6241-61943-0027 THE MEN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MIEN EXILES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE CENTRE OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESQUIMAUX BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLAR CIRCLE
6241-61946-0000 I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHILARATING DELIGHTS OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY
6241-61946-0001 HANS OUR EXCELLENT GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVARYING STEP
6241-61946-0002 OUR TWO HORSE WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WHIP OR SPUR
6241-61946-0003 GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTHWEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VERNACULAR IS CALLED SUVEST FIDINGER
6241-61946-0004 WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH HIGH AND SPARSE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
6241-61946-0005 THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEEDED IN A GOOD SHOW OF BATTLE
6241-61946-0006 I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE THEM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED CENTAUR
6241-61946-0007 SNOW TEMPESTED IMPRACTICABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
6241-61946-0008 WE CAN DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GUIDE
6241-61946-0009 I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXPERIENCE
6241-61946-0010 MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS WERE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
6241-61946-0011 HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BIRR OR ICELANDIC HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGARS ON THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE
6241-61946-0012 A FEW STRAY COWS AND SHEEP WERE NOT SEEN OCCASIONALLY
6241-61946-0013 LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE THAT AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNEFFELS WHERE AGGLOMERATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS
6241-61946-0014 IT CONSISTS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHICH IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
6241-61946-0015 I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE IF GARTER WAS TO BE FOUND
6241-61946-0016 THESE SACRED EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THIS PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM
6241-61946-0017 TO RIDE OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSES SEEMED TO ME ABSURD
6241-61946-0018 IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER MY OWN INTELLIGENCE THAN THEIRS
6241-61946-0019 BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOR TO RETURN
6241-61946-0020 AT LENGTH THE STURDY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON THE SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES
6241-61946-0021 HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING A DANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
6241-61946-0022 I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FIORD TO THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
6241-61946-0023 ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FERRYBOATS OF THE ELB I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN AND SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMOTION
6241-66616-0000 BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSED ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
6241-66616-0001 ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WABIGAGON'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS
6241-66616-0002 WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN ONE WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
6241-66616-0003 A COUNTERATTACK WAS MADE UPON WOONDA AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
6241-66616-0004 THREE DAYS LATER MINNETAKI BECAME NUZHAM'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
6241-66616-0005 FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FEUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COUNTRY A FEUD WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNTO THE SECOND GENERATION
6241-66616-0006 MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NUSIM AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
6241-66616-0007 THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND NEWSOME INSISTED THAT SHE WAS CALLED MINNETAKI
6241-66616-0008 CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABI RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETAKI AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE A WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
6241-66616-0009 WABI ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARTHY SINEWY AND AGILE AS A LYNX WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
6241-66616-0010 ONE OF NEWSOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THAT LITTLE MINNETAKI AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
6241-66616-0011 CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN MISTER ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS
6241-66616-0012 THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRIGHT PUPILS AND BY THE TIME WABI WAS SIXTEEN AND MINNETAKI TWELVE HE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS
6241-66616-0013 IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOONGS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS
6241-66616-0014 AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT LAID A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS
6241-66616-0015 BUT EACH LINE ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINNETAKI AND HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0016 NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTERS AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
6241-66616-0017 A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE OTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
6241-66616-0018 BUT IN TIME THE END OF ALL CAME AND WABI WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS'S MOTHER TO MINNETAKI AND TO HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0019 THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOY'S EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN GIRL WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
6241-66616-0020 SPRING CAME AND PERHAPS AND THEN SUMMER
6241-66616-0021 YOU SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN IN DETROIT IN THREE YEARS
6241-66616-0022 WE WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GETS A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKEN
6241-66616-0023 THREE WEEKS LATER CAME UBIGAWA'S REPLY
6241-66616-0024 ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET RODS SPRUCE WOOD ON THE BLACK STURGEON RIVER
6241-66616-0025 THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF WABI'S LETTER FOUND ROD AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO ITS NEW LIFE
6295-244435-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THAT HOME COMING
6295-244435-0001 COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT REGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND MADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGELY
6295-244435-0002 BUT THE EMOTIONS OF HARRY AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE OF LUXURY ONLY
6295-244435-0003 BOATS PUT OUT BOTH FROM THE FORGE AND THE SHORE
6295-244435-0004 THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER THE HARBOUR FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS ETCHED SHARPLY IN THE DAZZLING SUNSET OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY
6295-244435-0005 THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SUMTER WAS OURS
6295-244435-0006 BUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE SOON COMPLETED AND
6295-244435-0007 ALL THE AMENITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURING GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS
6295-244435-0008 THE GREATEST STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST AND NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSEE AND ARKANSAS FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KENTUCKY AND MISSOURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE
6295-244435-0009 LINCOLN HAD CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION BUT HARRY HEARD EVERYWHERE IN CHARLESTON THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS NOW SECURERS
6295-244435-0010 THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT DAVIS TO THEIR NEW CAPITOL SET IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FOE WAS TO BE ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH AND LOYALTY
6295-244435-0011 THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE MOMENT OF GLOOM
6295-244435-0012 EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD PROVE THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH
6295-244435-0013 AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTION SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERYWHERE WITH IT
6295-244435-0014 BEAUREGARD AT ONCE WROTE HIS ORDER
6295-244435-0015 COLONEL KENTON WRITES WISELY I
6295-244435-0016 WE NEED KENTUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE WILL BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE
6295-244435-0017 HENRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DE LAUNAY'S WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAGGAGE
6295-244435-0018 HE INTENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SOUGHT HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD HIM GOOD BYE
6295-244435-0019 HARRY BEGAN HIS FAREWELLS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET
6295-244435-0020 WHETHER HER MANNER WAS GRAVE OR FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN
6295-244435-0021 IT IS A DIFFERENT HARRY WHO STARTED HOME LATE IN APRIL
6295-244435-0022 TWO MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED AND GRAVE
6295-244435-0023 HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS AND HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF EM
6295-244435-0024 HE GAZED UPON THIS WORLD FULL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERILS
6295-244435-0025 THEN HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLESTON THE GAY THE VOLATILE AND THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION
6295-244435-0026 IT WAS ALMOST BURIED DOWN IN FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE
6295-244435-0027 THAT HE WAS GOING HOME AFTER VICTORY
6295-244435-0028 HE SOON LEFT JAMESTON OUT OF SIGHT
6295-244435-0029 HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATES
6295-244435-0030 PEOPLE WERE COOLER HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDE OF A QUESTION
6295-244435-0031 THE AIR TOO WAS UNLIKE THAT OF SOUTH CAROLINA THERE WAS A SHARPER TANG THROUGH IT
6295-244435-0032 IT WHIPPED HIS BLOOD AS IT BLEW BACK FROM THE SLOPES AND CRESTS
6295-244435-0033 IT WAS ABOUT NOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WINTON AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STURDY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIZE STRENGTH AND AGILITY
6295-244435-0034 THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES IN LITTLE KENTUCKY
6295-244435-0035 BILL SKELLY AND HIS GANG THEM MOUNTAINEERS ARE OUT
6295-244435-0036 HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOAT BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERYMAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT
6295-244435-0037 IF YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS JUST YOU TAKE ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID COLLINS
6295-244435-0038 HARRY THANKED HIM THROUGH HIS SADDLE BAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LIVERYMAN RODE AWAY
6295-244435-0039 THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT HARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE THAT NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE
6295-244435-0040 BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT MOVED IT NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED
6295-64301-0000 ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THAT DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITHY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOLIN SET OUT FOR TESTBRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA
6295-64301-0001 IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A SUNDAY AND SHE HAD CLOSED EARLY
6295-64301-0002 WAS HERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ALONG THE FOOTPATH
6295-64301-0003 HE PRESSED HIS VIOLIN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT CAN KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
6295-64301-0004 EARTH WAS GONE AND HEAVEN IS ALL
6295-64301-0005 BLESSED AM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLESSED SHALL I BE THERE NOW
6295-64301-0006 WHEN SHE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLORS
6295-64301-0007 JUST THEN HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SHADOWS
6295-64301-0008 THE NEDDLE IN THE DOCK SAID JOSEPH
6295-64301-0009 HE WAS IN THIS MOOD FOR MUSIC WAS HE NOT
6295-64301-0010 HE LAID DOWN HIS VIOLIN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TURNED HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRE
6295-64301-0011 LETTY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME PRISONER
6295-64301-0012 THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE BY THE DUMB INSTRUMENTS
6295-64301-0013 BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VIOLIN WERE SURE TO MERRY IN MUSIC
6295-64301-0014 AND THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED IN SILENCE
6295-64301-0015 HER HEART SEEMED TO SWELL UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM LEAPING
6295-64301-0016 A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SULLEN TEARS FLOWED FREELY
6295-64301-0017 LETTY TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY HIS MUSIC
6295-64301-0018 LET BUT A MOOD BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOUL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD AS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK AROUND AND HAUNT THE WORLD
6295-64301-0019 IT CRIED ALOUD THAT ETERNITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET HOME
6295-64301-0020 NOR IS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSICIAN
6295-64301-0021 I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIP WAS ENTREATY THAT KNEW NOT
6295-64301-0022 HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMANE IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF THE PART OF THE LOVE OF GOD
6295-64301-0023 WHEN THOU LOVEST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YEA OR EVEN DOG ARIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLORIES EVEN OF THEIR ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE
6295-64301-0024 HE THAT LOVETH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN HOW SHALL YOU LOVE GOD WHOM HE HATH NOT SEEN
6295-64301-0025 A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BURST FROM MARY'S BOSOM
6295-64301-0026 THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM USURPING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE AND DISPLACING IT WHEN IT CEASED HE WAS NOW HIS OWN MASTER
6295-64301-0027 HE STARTED TO CONSCIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID
6295-64301-0028 HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOLIN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PIANO AND THEN HIMSELF STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL
6295-64301-0029 IN THE ACT OF RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT START FROM THE BODY WITH A TEARING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD
6295-64301-0030 HIS VIOLIN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS HAND WAS MADE WHOLE
6295-64301-0031 HIS TREASURE TAKEN TYPE OF HIS SELF AND A WOMAN GIVING HIM INSTEAD
6295-64301-0032 IT'S JUST LIKE ME HE MURMURED
6313-66125-0000 YOU'LL ALL BE OVER IF YOU DON'T HAD A CARE
6313-66125-0001 THAT LOOKS LIKE A CLUMP OF BUSHES DOWN THERE BUT I AIN'T SURE CAN YOU MAKE IT OUT

6313-66125-0003 DON'T MOVE AROUND AND LIE PERFECTLY STILL WARNED THE GUIDE ARE YOU HURT
6313-66125-0004 BUT THAT TUMBLES ENOUGH TO KNOCK THE SENSE OUT OF A FULL GROWN MAN
6313-66125-0005 I COULD NOT THINK OF ALLOWING ANY OF MY CHARGES TO TAKE SO TERRIBLE A RISK THAT
6313-66125-0006 NO I ARE THE LIGHTER OF THE TWO URGED TAD
6313-66125-0007 I AM THE ONE TO GO AFTER WALT IF ANY ONE HAS TO I'LL GO DOWN MASTER THOMAS

6313-66125-0012 ARE WE READY YES
6313-66125-0013 HE TILTED HIS HEAD TO LOOKS UP
6313-66125-0014 THE MOVEMENT SENT ITS BODY SWAYING GIDDILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
6313-66125-0015 CAUTIOUSLY PRESSING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCK TO STEADY HIMSELF TAD WISELY CONCLUDED THAT HEREAFTER IT WOULD NOT PAY TO BE TOO CURIOUS
6313-66125-0016 SLOWLY BUT STEADILY THE TENDER LINE WAS PAID OUT AMID A TENSE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE CANYON
6313-66125-0017 AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO THEM HOURS A SHARP CALL FROM THE DEEPS REACHED THEIR EARS
6313-66125-0018 LIGE QUICKLY MADE FAST HIS LINE TO A TREE
6313-66125-0019 I KNOW HIM CALLED TAD HIS VOICE SOUNDING HOLLOW AND UNNATURAL TO THOSE ABOVE
6313-66125-0020 HE HAS SO FAR TO THE RIGHT OF ME THAT I CAN'T REACH HIM
6313-66125-0021 LODGED IN THE BRANCHES OF A PINON TREE I THINK IT IS BUT IT DOESN'T ANSWER ME
6313-66125-0022 LIGO LEANING OVER THE BRINK WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW THE BOY'S MOVEMENTS BY THE AID OF THE THIN ARC OF LIGHT MADE BY THE TORCH IN TAD'S HAND
6313-66125-0023 BUT FROM THE CAUTIOUS MOVEMENTS OF THE WHITE FAR BELOW THEM THE GUIDE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LAD WAS AT WORK CARRYING OUT HIS PART OF THE TASK OF RESCUE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY

6313-66125-0026 SURE THEN ANSWERED THE BOY
6313-66125-0027 NOR WAS HIS SENSE OF SECURITY INCREASED WHEN IN SHIFTING HIS POSITION THE TORCH FELL FROM HIS GRASP THE FAGOTS SCATTERING AS THEY SLID DOWN BETWEEN THE LIMBS OF THE TREE AND WHIRLING IN EVER DIMINISHING CIRCLES UNTIL FINALLY HE HEARD THEM CLATTER ON THE ROCKS BELOW
6313-66129-0000 HE NO DOUBT WOULD BRING MOOD OF SOME KIND WITH HIM
6313-66129-0001 WITH A SHOUT THE BOYS DASHED PELL MELL TO MEET THE PACK TRAIN AND FALLING IN BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING BURROWS URGED THEM ON WITH DERISIVE SHOUTS AND SUNDRY RESOUNDING SLAPS ON THE ANIMAL'S FLANK
6313-66129-0002 COLD WATER IS THE MOST NOURISHING THING WE'VE TOUCHED SINCE THE LAST NIGHT
6313-66129-0003 IF WE DID NOT IT MUST HAVE COME TO LIFE SOME TIME DURING THE NIGHT AND DUG ITS WAY OUT LAUGHED TAD

6313-66129-0008 HE BURIED HIS BISCUIT UNDER A LAYER OF JAM OVER WHICH HE SPREAD A THICK COATING OF COTTON
6313-66129-0009 PRESIDENT BROWNING I WITHDRAW MY CRITICISM I OFFER YOU MY HUMBLE APOLOGIES
6313-66129-0010 I RECKON THERE ARE MILES THE GUIDE WE ARE IN THE BEAR COUNTRY NOW

6313-66129-0012 THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FILLED THE OFFICERS WITH EXCITEMENT
6313-66129-0013 BUT I KNOW AN OLD SETTLER WHO WILL LEND US HIS DOG IF IT IS NOT OFF
6313-66129-0014 SUPPER HAVING BEEN FINISHED THE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR EVENING CHAT AFTER WHICH ADMONISHING STACY TO KEEP WITHIN HIS TENT AND NOT TO GO BORROWING TROUBLE THE BOYS TURNED IN FOR A SLEEP
6313-66129-0015 AS YET THEY HAD BEEN UNWILLING TO ATTEMPT ANY FANCY RIDING WITH THEIR PONIES OWING TO THE RUGGED NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN JOURNEYING
6313-66129-0016 THE BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO START WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALWAYS AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS
6313-66129-0017 THE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE BECOMING MORE SURE FOOTED EVERY DAY AND NED SAID THAT BEFORE THAT TRIP WAS FINISHED JIMMY WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK A SLACK ROPE
6313-66129-0018 AN EARLY START WAS MADE SO THAT A PARTY REACHED THE PROMISED TABLE LANDS SHORTLY BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK IN THE FORENOON
6313-66129-0019 THAT TEMPORARY CAMP WAS QUICKLY PITCHED
6313-66129-0020 THE GREAT GREENFIELD SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY TALL TREES MADE THE PLACE AN IDEAL ONE FOR THE PURPOSE
6313-66129-0021 IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL RACE THE LITTLE INDIAN PONIES SEEMING TO ENTER THOROUGHLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CONTEST STRETCHING THEMSELVES OUT TO THEIR FULL LENGTHS AND WITH HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR BACKS FAIRLY FLEW ACROSS THE GREAT PLATE OF GREEN
6313-66129-0022 ALL AGREED THAT TAD'S SUPERIOR HORSEMANSHIP ALONE HAD WON THE RACE FOR HIMSELF
6313-66129-0023 GALLOPING IN CAMP THE BOY FETCHED HIS SOMBRERO WHICH HE CARRIED WELL OUT INTO THE FIELD AND TOSSED AWAY
6313-66129-0024 THEN BIDDING THE BOYS STAND UP NEAR THE SPOT TO WATCH HIM HE DREW OFF SOME TEN RODS AND WHEELING SPURRED HIS PONY TO A RUN
6313-66129-0025 GRASPING THE POMMEL WITH THE LEFT HAND HE APPEARED TO DIVE HEAD FIRST TOWARD THE CROWD
6313-66129-0026 THEY SAW HIS LONG HAIR ALMOST BRUSH THE GRASS ONE OF HIS HANDS SWEPT DOWN AND UP AND ONCE MORE TAD BUTLER ROSE STANDING ON HIS STIRRUPS UTTERING A COWBOY YELL AS HE WAVED THE SOMBRERO ON HIGH
6313-66129-0027 IT BOYS HOWLED WITH DELIGHT THAT IS ALL DID SAVE STACY BROWN
6313-66129-0028 TSED IS AN EXPERIENCED WRITER
6313-66129-0029 THE FIRST TIME HE RODE SWIFTLY BY IT LEANING OVER TO LOOK AT THE CAT AS HE PASSED HOLDING TO THE POMMEL FIRMLY WITH HIS LEFT HAND
6313-66129-0030 WHAT'S THAT FOUR DEMANDED NED WONDERINGLY
6313-66129-0031 BUT TOO CLOSE TO ME I COULDN'T GET IT EXPLAINED CHUNKY THE BOYS ROARED
6313-66129-0032 WHY DON'T YOU MOVE THE COMPANY
6313-66129-0033 ONCE MORE STACY APPROACHED THE SOMBRERO HIS PONY RUNNING AND AS HE DREW NEAR IT THEY SAW HIM RISE IN THE SADDLE JUST AS TAD BUTLER HAD DONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE
6313-66129-0034 AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE FREED HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIRRUP HE THRUST HIS BODY SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT REACHING FOR THE HAT WITHOUT TAKING THE PRECAUTION TO GRASP THE POMMEL
6313-66129-0035 AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF STOPPING WHEN HE REACHED THE PIT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING
6313-76958-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP
6313-76958-0001 EVEN IF I CAN'T SINK I CAN BEAT THAT
6313-76958-0002 NOT ON THE RANGE WHY NOT DEMANDED THE BOYS
6313-76958-0003 A LOUDER LAUGH FOLLOWED AT CHUNKY'S EXPENSE
6313-76958-0004 THE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LAD I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AND THAT IS ALL THERE WAS TO IT
6313-76958-0005 WALTER HAD GONE OUT WITH THE SECOND GUARD AND THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMPFIRE FOR THEIR NIGHTLY STORY TELLING
6313-76958-0006 NONE OF YOU WILL BE FIT FOR STUDY TO MORROW
6313-76958-0007 WE'VE GOT A HARD DRIVE BEFORE US AND EVERY ONE MUST BE FIT AS A FIDDLE
6313-76958-0008 HUMPH GRUNTED CURLY HAMS
6313-76958-0009 THE COWBOY DID HIS VERY THING BUT WITHIN AN HOUR HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE THE OTHERS HAVING TURNED IN ONE BY ONE
6313-76958-0010 THE LADS FOUND THAT A PAIR OF BLANKETS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THEM WITH AN ORDINARY LINE SHEET DOUBLED FOR A TARPAULIN
6313-76958-0011 THESE THEY SPREAD OUT ON THE GROUND USING BOOTS WRAPPED INTO COATS FOR PILLOWS
6313-76958-0012 STACY BROWN WAS THE ONLY GRUMBLER IN THE LOT DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP A WEEK ON SUCH A BED AS THAT
6313-76958-0013 THE HORSES OF THE OUTFIT SAVE THOSE THAT WERE ON NIGHT DUTY AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS THAT HAD DEVELOPED A HABIT OF STRAYING HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE EARLY IN THE EVENING FOR ANIMALS ON THE TRAIN ARE SELDOM STAKED DOWN
6313-76958-0014 IN SPITE OF THEIR HARD COUCHES THE PONY RIDERS SLEPT SOUNDLY EVEN PROFESSOR ZEPPELIN HIMSELF NEVER BREAKING THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH
6313-76958-0015 STAYCY GRUMBLED TURNED OVER AND WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN
6313-76958-0016 YOU WON'T BE SO FAST TO MAKE UP HARD WORKING COWBOYS AFTER THAT I RECKON
6313-76958-0017 LUMPY BATES CAME RUNNING AFTER HIM NOT DARING TO CALL OUT FOR FEAR OF WAKING THE CAMP
6313-76958-0018 HI THERE HISSED LUMPIE FILLED WITH INDIGNATION THAT ANY ONE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MOUNT A PONY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE
6313-76958-0019 SOCY BROWN'S LEFT LEG SWUNG OVER THE SADDLE
6313-76958-0020 WHAT ARE THEY ASKED THE BOY
6313-76958-0021 KEEP A GOIN AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL RUN PLUMP INTO THEM WAS THE JEERING ANSWER AS THE SLEEPY COWMEN SPURRED THEIR PONIES ON TOWARD CAMP MUTTERING THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF TAKING ALONG A BUNCH OF BOYS ON A CATTLE DRIVE
6313-76958-0022 ALMOST BEFORE THE ECHOES OF THE VOICE HAD DIED AWAY A SHRILL VOICE PIPED UP FROM THE TAIL END OF THE CHUCK WAGON
6313-76958-0023 GREG PILE GRUB PILE
6313-76958-0024 WHO IS THE WRANGLER THIS MOMENT ASKED THE FOREMAN GLANCING ABOUT AT HIS MEN
6313-76958-0025 THE WRANGLER'S A WRANGLER ANSWERED BIG FOOT STODILY
6313-76958-0026 IT'S A FELLOW WHO'S ALL THE TIME MAKING TROUBLE ISN'T HE ASKED STACY INNOCENTLY
6313-76958-0027 OH NO THIS KIND OF A WRANGLER DOESN'T LAUGHED THE FOREMAN
6313-76958-0028 HE'S A TROUBLE CURER NOT A TROUBLE MAKER FOR HIMSELF
6313-76958-0029 PONG TOLD THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU IF YOU WERE TO SERVE BAD MEALS TO THIS OUTFIT OF COWPUNCHERS
6313-76958-0030 HOW ASKED TOD
6313-76958-0031 WE HAD BETTER START THE JOB THIS MORNING
6319-275224-0000 WHAT A FUSS IS MADE ABOUT IT MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
6319-275224-0001 YOU SURELY COULD NOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BARE STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON NOW
6319-275224-0002 YOUR COUSIN THE WILD CONVOLVULUS WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING KNOWS NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
6319-275224-0003 MY YOUNG PLANTS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WILL NOT LIVE AND THE POTS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIRE WORMS WHO DELIGHT TO DESTROY OUR ROOTS
6319-275224-0004 WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO LUXURIATE IN A NATIONAL MANNER
6319-275224-0005 STILL THE ROSE TREE TURNED OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS IN THE WOODS
6319-275224-0006 THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLIC ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILY INTO WHOSE REFINED EAR SHE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEM BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK
6319-275224-0007 HE REALLY GRIEVED TO SAY IT
6319-275224-0008 DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSE THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE CONDITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
6319-275224-0009 AGAIN NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUGGESTIONS
6319-275224-0010 ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF PITIFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACH
6319-275224-0011 MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVOLVULUS POLE TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE A ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELLED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND
6319-275224-0012 FINALLY HOW FARED IT WITH THE FLOWERS
6319-275224-0013 OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FAMILY FIR POLE
6319-275224-0014 THE HONEYSUCKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATION WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELLED HER TO A DIRT
6319-275224-0015 BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARM WORK TO LOOK FOR HIS PRETTY CHARGES
6319-275224-0016 BUT TO THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
6319-275224-0017 WEEDS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION REIGNED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND PLEASANT LITTLE GARDEN
6319-275224-0018 MY MISTRESS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVOURITE GARDEN
6319-275224-0019 IN THIS POSITION HE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
6319-275224-0020 I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TIE UP EVEN SOME OF THOSE AFRESH
6319-57405-0000 IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DEUCALION BUT HE WAS THE SON OF PROMETHEUS
6319-57405-0001 AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PROMETHEUS ON MOUNT CAUCASUS AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND FIRES INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
6319-57405-0002 THESE MAN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE
6319-57405-0003 BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER LAND
6319-57405-0004 NO ONE BUT DEUCALION THE SON OF PROMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A MORNING
6319-57405-0005 THE DAY IS COMING SAID PROMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SENT A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH
6319-57405-0006 BUT DEUCALION AND PYRRHA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
6319-57405-0007 IS HERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
6319-57405-0008 WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DEUCALION TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT LABORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
6319-57405-0009 GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAINS SAID MERCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPT INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
6319-57405-0010 WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED HERA
6319-57405-0011 SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DEUCALON
6319-57405-0012 WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SERVE THEM
6319-64726-0000 WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING FEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAVE NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN
6319-64726-0001 ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO TAKE
6319-64726-0002 THE RETURN OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIERCE HER HAND WITH A SPINDLE AND DIE OF THE WOUND
6319-64726-0003 IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY LORD HAS DONE
6319-64726-0004 NOT FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAT AN HONEST OLD WOMAN SPINNING FOR SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDICT
6319-64726-0005 SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINTS OF IT AND FAINTED AWAY
6319-64726-0006 HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAIT FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
6319-64726-0007 ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT THE WITCHES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A GREAT OGRE WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
6319-64726-0008 THIS YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FELT HIMSELF ON FIRE
6319-64726-0009 SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE ROAD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH
6319-64726-0010 HE ENTERED A LARGE FOUR CORNER AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AWE
6319-64726-0011 BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS AT THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT
6319-64726-0012 HE ENTERED THE GUARDS ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP
6319-64726-0013 HE PASSED FROM ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS OR STANDING
6319-64726-0014 AND I HAVE WAITED LONG FOR YOU
6319-64726-0015 THEY TALKED FOR SEVERAL HOURS AND HAD NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY
6319-64726-0016 MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS CASTLE HAD BEEN AWAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY
6319-64726-0017 THE LADY IN WAITING BECAME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITING FOR HER
6319-64726-0018 THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDOUR BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOKING HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT
6319-64726-0019 THE VIOLINS AND HOBOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND ALMONER MADE THE ROYAL LOVERS IN THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE
6319-64726-0020 I TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CASTLE BUT BEHOLD
6345-64257-0000 WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEANY AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE A LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB
6345-64257-0001 AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED ALIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE IN THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS IT FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE
6345-64257-0002 WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BENDY UNDESIRED HAD KINDLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURAL UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL
6345-64257-0003 SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SWOOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHOOK
6345-64257-0004 THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS HE COULD RECALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING FROM IT WITH A CRY
6345-64257-0005 SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY WITH A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND
6345-64257-0006 IT WAS THE SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT AT WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLOURS AND ODOURS
6345-64257-0007 THEN SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
6345-64257-0008 AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS ON A PLACE OF TOMBS
6345-64257-0009 SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANT SOFT FOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEEDED HER
6345-64257-0010 HE WAS LOST LOST UTTERLY WITH AN ETERNAL LOSS
6345-64257-0011 SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOWHERE TO GO OR WHERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL
6345-64257-0012 FOR LIVING SOUL THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEET
6345-64257-0013 SHE HAD LOST THEM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM
6345-64257-0014 HE CAME TO HER SIDE AND SHE MADE HIM NO GREETING
6345-64257-0015 I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO ASKING
6345-64257-0016 THE OLD LIFE WAS BUT A THICKER DREAM AND THIS IS TRUER BECAUSE MORE SHADOWY
6345-64257-0017 HER ONLY LIFE WAS BUT SHE WAS LOST
6345-64257-0018 SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE AIR OF A MIST A FUME FROM MY OWN BRAIN
6345-64257-0019 THIS WAS SHE BORNE AWAY CAPTIVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER WILLING NOR UNWILLING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS
6345-64257-0020 WITHOUT THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN
6345-93302-0000 SHE HERSELF COULD HAVE BEEN A POEM A LYRIC IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOUGHS
6345-93302-0001 HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUEBELLS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD HIM UP TO HIS FACE IN MAIDENLY DEFENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS
6345-93302-0002 YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TRYST IS CONDUCTED ON THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POETS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEEKLY JOURNALS
6345-93302-0003 SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF THE READING IN HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SENSE
6345-93302-0004 AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE WOULD HAVE TO SAY
6345-93302-0005 SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE ORCHARD INSTEAD OF JANUARY AND THE DINGY DUSTY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PREOCCUPIED TRAVELLERS THE GRIM DESOLATE WEATHER
6345-93302-0006 THE SETTING OF THE SCENE SEEMED TO HIM ALL IMPORTANT
6345-93302-0007 IT WAS PITIFULLY COLD BUT THE EMBANKMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE
6345-93302-0008 SHE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD OFFERED NO EXCUSE NO EXPLANATION
6345-93302-0009 BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK ON ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
6345-93302-0010 THAT KEEN WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET
6345-93302-0011 HER HANDS AND FOOT WERE ACHING WITH COLD
6345-93302-0012 SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOW HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK HOUR
6345-93302-0013 SHE SAID HOW FRIGHTFULLY COLD HE IS
6345-93302-0014 BUT YESTERDAY I HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARLING
6345-93302-0015 A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER SO THIS WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS
6345-93302-0016 WHAT OPINION HAD HE FORM OF THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNOCENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FAILED TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY
6345-93302-0017 FOLLOWING THE TINGLE OF RELIEFS CAME A SHARP SICKENING PINCH OF JEALOUSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER
6345-93302-0018 I DON'T WONDER YOU WERE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE EVER LOVED ME I WAS AN IDIOT TO BELIEVE YOU DID
6345-93302-0019 THOSE POOR TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST
6345-93302-0020 COULDN'T HELP IT WHEN HOW CAN I EVER TRUST YOU
6345-93302-0021 DO YOU THINK I'M NOT HAPPY NOW
6345-93302-0022 NO IT'S ONLY WONDERFUL FOR BOTH OF US
6345-93302-0023 I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING OFF HER GLOVES GO HOME AND GLOAT OVER IT ALL
6345-93302-0024 HE STOOD UP PRESENTLY DO YOU MEAN IT
6345-93302-0025 ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OUT FOR A THING LIKE THIS
6345-93302-0026 AND HE STRODE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND UP BY THE SWING DOOR IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXIT
6345-93302-0027 IN THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK AND REMEDY THAT ERROR
6345-93302-0028 YOU CHECKED THE SILLY IMPULSE
6345-93302-0029 SO HE ENLISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDALS AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXCLAMATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
6345-93306-0000 THE LAST STRAINS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL FATED INTERMEZZO HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RUMBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDEROUS BERYL ORGAN WHICH HAD SO GAYLY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TUNES OF ITS REPERTORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSEMAID AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CROWING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR
6345-93306-0001 THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WAX CANDLES AND THE SOLID SILVER CANDLESTICKS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DUSK WAS FALLING AND THE ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE MEASURE OF THE DAY'S APPOINTED TORTURE
6345-93306-0002 NOW THERE WAS SILENCE THEN A SIGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRAVEL
6345-93306-0003 THEN AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUIET PLEASURE
6345-93306-0004 NEVER HAD ANY ACCIDENT SEEMED SO IMPOSSIBLE
6345-93306-0005 THERE IS A SEAT IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HERE SHE HESITATED
6345-93306-0006 THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUARTER INDICATED AND DISAPPEARED AMONG THE LAUREL BUSHES
6345-93306-0007 LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW YOU WERE TIRED OUT AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHAT IS IT
6345-93306-0008 DO DRINK THIS AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP
6345-93306-0009 HE HURRIEDLY CUT COAT AND PRESSED IT UPON HER
6345-93306-0010 HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM
6345-93306-0011 IS IT ONLY THAT YOU'RE POOR AH THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TOO SHE LAUGHED
6345-93306-0012 AND HER LITTLE FOOT TAPPED THE GRAVEL IMPATIENTLY
6345-93306-0013 HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOTEL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THEATER MY MAID A HORRID FRENCH THING WE HAD IN PARIS PACKED UP ALL MY TRUNKS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PAID THE BILL AND WENT
6345-93306-0014 SHE ASKED AGAIN YOU ARE KIND
6345-93306-0015 WELL WHEN I WENT INTO LODGINGS THAT WICKED WOMAN HAD LEFT ME ONE STREET SUIT AND TO DAY THEY TURNED ME OUT BECAUSE MY MONEY WAS ALL GONE
6345-93306-0016 LET ME THINK HE SAID O HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU HAPPENED TO COME THIS WAY
6345-93306-0017 I SHALL LOCK UP ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOW IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHALL GIVE YOU MY LATCH KEY AND YOU CAN LET YOURSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
6345-93306-0018 I WILL CATCH THE NIGHT TRAIN AND BRING YOUR MOTHER UP TO MORROW THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
6345-93306-0019 YOU SEE PAPA'S SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT ME TO TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH DUKES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPT
6345-93306-0020 IT WASN'T I WHO SAID THAT SAID THE GIRL SMILING BUT THAT'S SO SOMEHOW AND THEN SHE SIGHED
6345-93306-0021 ALL THE SAME SHE ADDED IRRELEVANTLY YOU SHALL HAVE THE LATCH KEY
6345-93306-0022 YOU WERE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND OUT TO HIM HE DID NOT KISS IT THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY
6345-93306-0023 THE LADY WITH THE GUITAR CERTAINLY PASSED THE NIGHT AT HILLVIEW VILLA BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER VERY ANGRY AND VERY FRIGHTENED CAME UP WITH HIM AT ABOUT NOON THE HOUSE LOOKED JUST AS USUAL AND NO ONE WAS THERE BUT THE CHARWOMAN
6345-93306-0024 THE SILVER IS ALL RIGHT THANK GOODNESS SHE SAID BUT YOUR BANJO GIRL HAS GIVEN A PAIR OF YOUR SISTER'S SILK STOCKINGS AND THOSE NEW SHOES OF HERS WITH THE SILVER BUCKLES AND SHE'S LEFT THESE
6345-93306-0025 IT WAS PLAIN THAT HIS CASTANET GIRL HIS MOTHER AND SISTER TOOK A PLEASURE IN CORRECTING HER DAILY WITH SOME FRESH AND UNPLEASING INSTRUMENT COULD HAVE HAD NEITHER TASTE MONEY NOR HONESTY TO SUCH A POINT AS THIS

652-130726-0002 ONE OF HIS WAITERS PHIL TYSON WAS ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES TO GO BACK INTO THE BURN DISTRICT TO BEGIN BUSINESS AND HE OPENED A RESTAURANT CALLED THE DELMONTI IN POWELL STREET NEAR MARKET BUT IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR SUCCESS AND CLOSED AFTER A SHORT CAREER
652-130726-0003 HERE AS WELL AS IN THE NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES ONE CAN WELL APPRECIATE THE COLLOQUIAL DEFINITION OF CABARET
652-130726-0004 HERE THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC AND FOOD WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED AND ALWAYS A LIVELY CROWD DURING LUNCHEON DINNER AND AFTER THEATRE HOURS THE ROOM IS NOT LARGE BUT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE GREATLY MAGNIFIED OWING TO THE COVERING OF MIRRORS WHICH LINE THE WALL
652-130726-0005 THIS GARISH DISPLAY OF MIRRORS AND ELABORATE DECORATION OF CEILING AND PILLARS GIVES IT THE APPEARANCE OF AN ABODE OF SATURNALIA BUT DECORUM IS THE RULE AMONG THE PATRONS

652-130726-0015 IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS WORTH WHILE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPRIETORS DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE DECORATIVE FUTURE AND TOO LITTLE ON THE FOOD AND HOW THEY SERVE IT

777-126732-0008 HIS ENUNCIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS TOTALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO A STRANGER
777-126732-0009 THE OLD TERRORIST TURNED SLOWLY HIS HAT ON HIS SKINNY NECK FROM SIDE TO SIDE

777-126732-0023 THE FAMOUS TERRORIST HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE RAISED PERSONALLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FINGER AGAINST SOCIAL EDIFICE
777-126732-0024 THE SHADOW OF THIS EVIL GIFT CLUNG TO HIM YET LIKE THE SMELL OF A DEADLY DRUG IN AN OLD VIAL OF POISON EMPTIED NOW USELESS READY TO BE THROWN AWAY UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP OF THINGS THAT HAD SERVED THEIR TIME
777-126732-0025 MICHAELIS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE SMILED VAGUELY WITH HIS GLUED LIPS HIS PASTY MOON FACE DROOPED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A MELANCHOLY ASCENT
777-126732-0026 HE HAD BECOME A PRISONER HIMSELF
777-126732-0027 HIS OWN SKIN HAD SIZZLED UNDER THE RED HOT BREATH HE MURMURED SOFTLY
777-126732-0028 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE BEGAN DISDAINFULLY BUT STOPPED SHORT INARMINATED BY THE DEAD BLACKNESS OF THE CAVERNOUS EYES IN THE FACE TURNED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM WITH A BLIND STARE AS IF GUIDED ONLY BY THE SOUND
777-126732-0029 SHE GAVE THE DISCUSSION UP WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS
777-126732-0030 STEVIE ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DISREGARDED HAD GONE UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE CARRYING OFF HIS DRAWING TO BED WITH HIM
777-126732-0031 THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND HE REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TERRORIST AS IF ROOTED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY THE MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN
777-126732-0032 HIS SCARED EYES BLAZED WITH INDIGNATION THAT WOULD HURT TERRIBLY HIS MOUTH DROPPED OPEN
777-126732-0033 COMRADE OCCIVIN'S FACE TWITCHED WITH EXASPERATION
777-126732-0034 I DON'T SAY THAT PROTESTED MYCALLIS GENTLY
777-126732-0035 HIS VISION OF TRUTH HAD GROWN SO INTENSE THAT THE SOUND OF HIS STRANGE VOICE FAILED TO ROUT THIS TIME
777-126732-0036 THE COALS IN THE GRATE SETTLED DOWN WITH A SLIGHT CRASH AND MICHAELIS THE HERMIT OF VISIONS IN A DESERT OF A PENITENTIARY GOT UP IMPETUOUSLY
777-126732-0037 THE DISDAINFUL POUT OF COMRADE OCCIPIN'S THICK LIPS ACCENTUATED THE NEGROTYPE OF HIS FACE
777-126732-0038 HE PAUSED THEN ANSWERED WITH A MODEST FIRMNESS
777-126732-0039 THEY WOULD CALL IT CANNIBALISTIC THAT'S WHAT IT IS
777-126732-0040 THEY ARE NOURISHING THEIR GREEDS ON THE QUIVERING FLESH AND THE WARM BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOTHING ELSE
777-126732-0041 STEVIE SWALLOWED THE TERRIFYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUDIBLE GULP AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LIMPLY IN A SITTING POSTURE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOORWAY
777-126732-0042 HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRAINED VIOLENCE TURNED A KEY SHOT THE BOLTS
777-126732-0043 AND HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS FRIENDS
777-126732-0044 WITH THE INSIGHT OF A KINDRED TREATMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT
777-126732-0045 THERE ARE NATURES TOO TO WHOSE SENSE OF JUSTICE THE PRICE EXACTED LOOMS UP MONSTROUSLY ENORMOUS ODIOUS OPPRESSIVE WEARYING HUMILIATING EXTORTIONATE INTOLERABLE THOSE ARE THE FANATICS
777-126732-0046 IN ANY CASE HE HAD NOT THIS TIME
777-126732-0047 LOATHING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS WHO KNEW NOT MISTER VLADIMIR AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHENAS HE HAD A WOMAN TO PROVIDE FOR
777-126732-0048 THESE WERE BUT A FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED THE SHOP HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF HIS VALUE
777-126732-0049 YOUR SURVEY WAS UNFAVORABLE
777-126732-0050 HE TOOK A CASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEVIE WAS STILL DOWN STAIRS
777-126732-0051 HE LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW BUT HE DARED NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION
777-126732-0052 MISTER VERLOC BELIEVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO STEVIE
777-126732-0053 HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOR AND LOOKED TO THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE
777-126732-0054 HE WATCH HIM GESTICULATING AND MURMURING IN THE KITCHEN
777-126732-0055 STUFFY PROWLED ROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL IN A CAGE
777-126732-0056 THE LIGHT THROWN OUT BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOW SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIR DONE UP IN SEVERAL PLATES FOR THE NIGHT
777-126732-0057 HER BARE FEET AS IF POKED THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF AN UNADORNED SLEEVED CALICO SACK BUTTONED TIGHTLY AT NECK AND WRISTS FELT OVER THE RUG FOR THE SLIPPERS WHILE SHE LOOKED UPWARD IN HER HUSBAND'S FACE
777-126732-0058 THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT HELPS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE
777-126732-0059 IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE SUDDENLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UNINHABITED AND THIRSTY PLAINS
777-126732-0060 THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER VERLOC BECAUSE HE HAD SAT ASTRIDE VARIOUS ARMY OFFICERS IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCIPIENT FALL
777-126732-0061 THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLANK AS THE WINDOW PANE AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD
777-126732-0062 YES NOT AT ALL WHILE
777-126732-0063 DOWN BELOW IN THE QUIET NARROW STREET MEASURED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEN DIED AWAY UNHURRIED AND FIRM AS IF THE PASSER BY HAD STARTED TO PACE ON ALL ETERNITY FROM GAS LAMP TO GAS LAMP IN A NIGHT WITHOUT END AND THE DROWSY TICKING OF THE OLD CLOCK ON THE LANDING BECAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE BEDROOM
777-126732-0064 THAT POOR BOY IS IN A VERY DECIDED STATE TO NIGHT SHE MURMURED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH LASTED FOR THREE TICKS OF THE CLOCK
777-126732-0065 THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT STAVIE HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED
777-126732-0066 THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DOCILE THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS WOMEN DID NOT UPSET HIS POOR HEAD
777-126732-0067 MISTER VERLOC'S ANXIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS THINKING
777-126732-0068 THAT BOY HEARS TOO MUCH O WHAT IS TALKED ABOUT HERE
777-126732-0069 IF I HAD KNOWN THEY ARE COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID
777-126732-0070 HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WHEN SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND DRINKING BLOOD WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT
777-126732-0071 MISTER VERLOC WAS ONLY RESPONSIVE NOW
777-126732-0072 ASK KARL YANDT HE GROWLED SAVAGELY
777-126732-0073 HE ISN'T FIT TO HEAR WHAT'S SAID YET HE BELIEVES IT'S ALL TRUE
777-126732-0074 HE KNOWS NO BETTER HE GETS INTO HIS PAINS OVER IT
777-126732-0075 HE GLARED AT ME AS IF HE DON'T KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I WENT DOWN STAIRS
777-126732-0076 I WISH HE HAD NEVER BEEN AT SCHOOL MISSUS VERLOC BEGAN AGAIN BRUSQUELY
777-126732-0077 HE TAKES A RED FACE PORING OVER THEM
777-126732-0078 I DIDN'T GIVE A HALFPENNY FOR THE WHOLE LOT
777-126732-0079 THE OTHER DAY STEVIE GOT HOLD OF ONE AND THERE WAS A STORY IN IT OF A GERMAN SOLDIER OFFICER TEARING HALF OFF THE ARM OF A RECRUIT AND NOTHING WAS DONE TO HIM FOR IT THE BRUTE
777-126732-0080 THEY CAN'T STAND A NOTION OF ANY CRUELTY
777-126732-0081 COMFORTABLE DEAR DEAR
7850-111771-0000 THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF HONOURABLE THOMAS R HAMMER HE WAS ADMITTED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
7850-111771-0001 AT THIS TIME GRACE WAS NOT TAKEN WITH WAR AND PROBABLY EVINCED LITTLE INTEREST IN ARMY TACTICS
7850-111771-0002 GRANT ACTED AS MUSTERING OFFICER UNTIL BEING COMMISSIONED COLONEL OF THE TWENTY FIRST ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS HE TOOK THE FIELDS
7850-111771-0003 GENERAL HELLECK IN SPEAKING OF THIS BATTLES SAID
7850-111771-0004 INDEED IF EVER A GENERAL DESERVED HONOR GRANT HAD WON IT HE HAD OPENED THE MISSISSIPPI TO NAVIGATION AND HAD CAPTURED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS FOR ARMS
7850-111771-0005 HE WAS THEN COMMANDER OF ALL THE FEDERAL FORCES
7850-111771-0006 THIS CAPTURE OF LEE WAS A FAR MORE DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING
7850-111771-0007 TIME WORE AWAY AND ON THE NINTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE GRANT CAPTURED THE CONFEDERATE ARMY UNDER LEE THUS VIRTUALLY ENDING THE WAR
7850-111771-0008 WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE AND SON JESSE AND A FEW FRIENDS
7850-111771-0009 HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTGROWTH OF HARD STUDY AN ABILITY TO PERFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTIVE LABOUR WITHOUT FATIGUE
7850-281318-0000 SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BERMAKINS
7850-281318-0001 INDEED IT IS NOT A NEST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF IT
7850-281318-0002 AND THERE IS THE OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU
7850-281318-0003 WHY WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME
7850-281318-0004 AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THE FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY
7850-281318-0005 SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER
7850-281318-0006 SHE POPPED INTO A NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES
7850-281318-0007 BUT SHE SAW ALL THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY
7850-281318-0008 THEN ALL THE OTHER BOYS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASK HER TO TEACH US
7850-281318-0009 SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPPING TWITTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOME
7850-281318-0010 OH WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING LATE AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY
7850-281318-0011 THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH HIM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENT DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS
7850-281318-0012 AND WHERE EACH BIRD PERCHED THERE IS TO BUILD ITS NEST
7850-281318-0013 SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY WOULD BE MADE
7850-281318-0014 THEN SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES
7850-281318-0015 I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGINNING
7850-281318-0016 CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACKAW
7850-281318-0017 HERE WOODPIGEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLACE THOSE STICKS THROUGH AND ACROSS CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SEWN
7850-281318-0018 CRISSCROSSED CRISSCROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOODPIGEON
7850-281318-0019 YOU SEE YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH YOUR NESTS BY YOURSELVES
7850-281318-0020 HOW MUCH LUCK MAY YOU HAVE
7850-281318-0021 AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSY NEST ON THE ELM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
7850-281318-0022 BUT THE WOODPIGEON IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL
7850-281318-0023 FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRISS CROSS AS A MAGPIE HAD SHOWN HER
7850-286674-0000 A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBOURS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM BUT IT IS NOT SO
7850-286674-0001 IT IS DISGRACE DISGRACEFUL
7850-286674-0002 THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM THAT BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL
7850-286674-0003 THEY ALWAYS ATE A PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS
7850-286674-0004 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST THEY NEVER DID
7850-286674-0005 THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS NOR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
7850-286674-0006 BOTH BOOKS ASKED THE LARVAE
7850-286674-0007 WELL OUR LOWER PARTS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH
7850-286674-0008 OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DONT MATTER
7850-286674-0009 THEY KNEW THAT WHEN EVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWERED LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
7850-286674-0010 INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THIS AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
7850-286674-0011 BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THAT WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
7850-286674-0012 SCARED DH WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE
7850-286674-0013 HERE COMES THE SNAPPY DIRT
7850-286674-0014 SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BAG SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT
7850-286674-0015 THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER
7850-286674-0016 HE BEGAN TO DRAW ON HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OFF UNDER HIS TAIL
7850-286674-0017 THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN ALONG
7850-73752-0000 FERDINAND MEDITATES OVER THE GOOD FORTUNE
7850-73752-0001 IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING ALIKE SUDDEN BURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS I MUST BE ALONE
7850-73752-0002 IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNES AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGER AND DISGRACE
7850-73752-0003 THIS SILENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY OUR FRIEND FERDINAND ARMINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUS MIRABELLE WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVERCOMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES
7850-73752-0004 FERNAND FOUND HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS
7850-73752-0005 IT WAS INDEED THEIR HANDWRITING
7850-73752-0006 RESTLESS WITH IMPENDING JOY HE SAUNTERED TO A BRIDGE AND LEANT OVER THE BALUSTRADE GAZING ON THE WATERS IN CHARMED AND CHARMING VACANCY
7850-73752-0007 HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOW MANY FEELINGS FLITTED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE DID HE NOT CHEW A CUD
7850-73752-0008 FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FORLORN OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE BLESSINGS OF THAT WORLD SEEMED SHOWERED AT HIS FEET
7850-73752-0009 THE MOST GIFTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN PROVING WHICH MAINTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION
7850-73752-0010 HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLESSINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM ARE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA
7850-73752-0011 HIS CONSTANCY TO HER WAS NOW REWARD
7850-73752-0012 AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THAT FUTURE MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO THEM
7850-73752-0013 IT WAS INDEED DANCING AND A VOLCANO
7850-73752-0014 AND NOW ALL THAT ENDED SO HAPPILY
7850-73752-0015 WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAS BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER
7850-73752-0016 THEY MIGHT BE ENCHANTED BUT THAT WAS THE TALISMAN
7850-73752-0017 IN THEIR PRESENT UNSETTLED THOUGH HOPEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FERDINAND WOULD NOT GO HOME
7850-73752-0018 IN EXACTLY TEN MINUTES IT IS IN THE POWER OF EVERY MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FOR ALL THE TUMULTS OF THE WORLD THE PANGS OF LOVE THE THROBS OF AMBITION THE WEAR AND TEAR OF PLAY THE RECRIMINATING BOUDOIR THE CONSPIRING CLUB THE RATTLING HELL AND FIND HIMSELF IN A SUBLIME SYLVAN SOLITUDE SUPERIOR TO THE CEDARS OF LEBANON AND INFERIOR ONLY IN EXTENT TO THE CHESTNUT FORESTS OF ANATOLIA
7850-73752-0019 IS MADAM ALONE INQUIRED MISS TEMPLE
7976-105575-0000 GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH A COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HARDEST FOUGHT BATTLE OF A CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER
7976-105575-0001 YOUR OWN REGIMENT WAS IN THE ADVANCE
7976-105575-0002 OUR BRIGADE WAS FEARFULLY OUTNUMBERED AND
7976-105575-0003 THERE WERE NO BREASTWORKS AND YET THAT ONE LITTLE BRIGADE OF HAMILTON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPULSED ASSAULT AFTER ASSAULT
7976-105575-0004 NOT BALAKLAVA NOR THE ALMAH SAW SUCH FIGHTING IT IS THE DUEL TO THE DEATH
7976-105575-0005 NO BATTERY IN THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS WAR COST SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT A TIME
7976-105575-0006 ONE DARING REBEL WAS SHOT DOWN AND BAYONETTED FROM BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY B WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT
7976-105575-0007 THAT NIGHT THE ENEMY SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE FIELD
7976-105575-0008 WITH A FEW LANTERNS OUR MEN THEN WENT UP AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE DEAD WERE LEFT TILL MORNING
7976-105575-0009 IT WAS NOT A QUESTION OF WHO WAS DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHAT WAS NOT
7976-105575-0010 FIFTEEN OFFICERS OF OUR LITTLE BLACK REGIMENT WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED
7976-105575-0011 I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH THAT COMRADE WHO SHARED MY BLANKET WITH ME POOR JIMMY KING
7976-105575-0012 HE SURVIVED THE WAR ONLY TO BE RENDERED LATER ON A PLANTATION IN MISSISSIPPI
7976-105575-0013 WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTRE LEFT WE GET THE WORST OF IT TOO
7976-105575-0014 THAT EVENING AN ORDER CAME FOR THIS HAMILTON'S DIVISION TO ASSAULT THE ENEMY'S LEFT FLANK AT MIDNIGHT
7976-105575-0015 UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAY THAT VICTORIOUS REBEL ARMY
7976-105575-0016 ONCE IN THE NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BIVOUAC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD TISHMEINGO HOTEL TO SEE A LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST
7976-105575-0017 I COULD NOT HELP MY FATHER
7976-105575-0018 GO BACK TO THE REGIMENT HE SAID SMILING AND WILL BE NEEDED
7976-105575-0019 MY FRIEND OF MANY OTHERS WAS BEING CARRIED OUT TO DIE ELSEWHERE
7976-105575-0020 AND HASTENED BACK TO THE LINES
7976-105575-0021 THE CLOUD OF THE REBELS WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS
7976-105575-0022 A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TOO MOWED THEM DOWN LIKE GLASS
7976-105575-0023 THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DOZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE WORKERS
7976-105575-0024 THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER A OAK TREE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AMONG THE UNBURIED DEAD
7976-105575-0025 AND INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT IN THOSE DAYS
7976-105575-0026 ROSECRANTZ PROTESTED THAT WAS IN VAIN
7976-105575-0027 IT REQUIRED MINUTES AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME
7976-105575-0028 FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HATCHIE BRIDGE ARE NOT BURIED
7976-105575-0029 A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON THE CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOGS WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR
7976-110124-0000 LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT WHO HAD SEVERAL DAUGHTERS
7976-110124-0001 EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON HER ACCOUNT
7976-110124-0002 HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU
7976-110124-0003 WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BAND INTO A NEARBY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANTS HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
7976-110124-0004 HAVE PITY UPON A POOR UNFORTUNATE GIRL HE CALLED OUT
7976-110124-0005 LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS THE NIGHTS UNDER YOUR ROOF
7976-110124-0006 IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES ON THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
7976-110124-0007 HE'S OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID
7976-110124-0008 IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT WAS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT
7976-110124-0009 BUT YOU SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
7976-110124-0010 HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE VISITOR
7976-110124-0011 IT IS A DREADFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING
7976-110124-0012 WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE EMPEROR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM
7976-110124-0013 THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT IT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY
7976-110124-0014 SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD DONE ITS WORK
7976-110124-0015 THEN SHE SAW HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE
7976-110124-0016 HE WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN
7976-110124-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN OUTWIT HER YET SIGHED ANOTHER
7976-110124-0018 THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE ONLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED
7976-110124-0019 I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO YOU YOU NO HARM
7976-110124-0020 YOU SHALL NOT COME DOWN TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE
7976-110124-0021 PASS THE CHARM UP TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER
7976-110124-0022 WHEN HE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH A HOLE IN THE DOOR
7976-110124-0023 THE CRIES AND CURSES OF THEIR ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR
7976-110124-0024 AND THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT DOORS
7976-110124-0025 AND ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH
7976-110523-0000 HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE ON THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US
7976-110523-0001 HOW CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAD NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES
7976-110523-0002 OH YOU SIMPLETON SAYS SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLAN THE COFFINS FOR US
7976-110523-0003 BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL SHE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN
7976-110523-0004 AND AS SOON AS THEIR FRIENDS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT
7976-110523-0005 AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THIS HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE
7976-110523-0006 AND IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH
7976-110523-0007 BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THIS LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN
7976-110523-0008 EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED HIM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE
7976-110523-0009 WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE SHALL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN
7976-110523-0010 HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOT TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY
7976-110523-0011 COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED HIM INTO HER COTTAGE
7976-110523-0012 THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAYLAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BOAT HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY
7976-110523-0013 THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED WILDLY IT WAS OF NO USE
7976-110523-0014 GRETTELL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED
7976-110523-0015 GRETTEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MOMENT I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM
7976-110523-0016 DEAR GOOD GOD HELP US NOW HE PRAYED
7976-110523-0017 CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANDSEL
7976-110523-0018 WHY I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF
7976-110523-0019 AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HAIR INTO THE OVEN
7976-110523-0020 AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO A WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES
7976-110523-0021 THEN THEY BEGIN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK
8297-275154-0000 NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE TO SIDNEY'S INTEREST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB
8297-275154-0001 THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERED TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER
8297-275154-0002 THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED IT PUZZLED RANDAL
8297-275154-0003 RANDAL WAITED AWHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENNYDECK MAY PAY HIM A VISIT
8297-275154-0004 HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SIDUM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM
8297-275154-0005 HAD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED ME
8297-275154-0006 RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGES OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW
8297-275154-0007 AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HERBERT
8297-275154-0008 YOU TRUST ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY
8297-275154-0009 I DRANK THE WINE GREEDILY
8297-275154-0010 WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON THEM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER
8297-275154-0011 HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S ACTION
8297-275154-0012 RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE CYDNEY IS
8297-275154-0013 YOU WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER
8297-275154-0014 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THIS ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK
8297-275154-0015 I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT AGAIN
8297-275154-0016 I COULDN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF
8297-275154-0017 OH WHY DID I ASK THAT GOVERNESS
8297-275154-0018 I'RE AFRAID HE SAID
8297-275154-0019 I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT LIFE I TOOK JUST NOW
8297-275154-0020 HE BOWED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD
8297-275154-0021 WAS HIS MIND WANDERING UPON SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT
8297-275154-0022 YE CAN'T DO IT
8297-275154-0023 LET ME THINK WHAT IT IS FIRST
8297-275154-0024 I FEEL FOR YOU CHARLOTTE HE SAID WARMLY
8297-275154-0025 SHE HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE
8297-275154-0026 LET ME REST A LITTLE HE REPEATED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY
8297-275154-0027 HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THOSE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAK UP OF THE FAMILY
8297-275155-0000 ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SIDENHAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER
8297-275155-0001 THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDAL GOT IT
8297-275155-0002 AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE
8297-275155-0003 RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FEW WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH
8297-275155-0004 WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS SLOWLY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER
8297-275155-0005 MISSUS ROBIN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER
8297-275155-0006 MISSUS PRESTY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTING TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL
8297-275155-0007 HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE
8297-275155-0008 SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM SIGNIFICANTLY
8297-275155-0009 BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SEYDENHAM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS
8297-275155-0010 A REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FRIEND
8297-275155-0011 BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS SECRET NEWSPAPERS
8297-275155-0012 YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT KATHERINE WAS A WIDOW
8297-275155-0013 SIT DOWN SAID MISSUS PRESITY
8297-275155-0014 YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSELE AFTER YOU LEFT US
8297-275155-0015 YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR THE COMING OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERCY ON HER
8297-275155-0016 HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISTER NORMAN AND TO MISSUS NORMAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM
8297-275155-0017 WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER I NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE
8297-275155-0018 AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KITTY THAT MISSUS ROBIN WAS A WIDOW
8297-275155-0019 WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU LESS STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED
8297-275155-0020 BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME INTO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER
8297-275155-0021 HONESTLY YES
8297-275155-0022 AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN
8297-275155-0023 HE ASKED DIRECTLY IF HER FATHER WAS DEAD
8297-275155-0024 THAT WOULD DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENSE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS
8297-275155-0025 RANDLE PASSED THIS OVER WITHOUT NOTICE
8297-275155-0026 A VERY WISE POSITION SHE REMARKED
8297-275155-0027 HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BENNYDECKE
8297-275155-0028 NOT AT THEIR HOTEL JUST NOW
8297-275155-0029 IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN THIS FRIEND
8297-275155-0030 GOOD BYE DEARE RANDAL
8297-275155-0031 ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDEL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN
8297-275155-0032 WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS FATHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN
8297-275156-0000 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE EXCLAIMED
8297-275156-0001 YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN COUSIN
8297-275156-0002 WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT DOESN'T IT
8297-275156-0003 NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE READER CAN SUPPLY
8297-275156-0004 SUPPOSING MY REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE
8297-275156-0005 IN THE MEAN TIME AFTER WHICH MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD
8297-275156-0006 HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARDS PERSUADING KATHERINE TO GRANT SYDNEY AN INTERVIEW
8297-275156-0007 EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SEDENHAM
8297-275156-0008 BE THE RESULTS ALWAYS WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW
8297-275156-0009 CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY OUGHT TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND
8297-275156-0010 WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE
8297-275156-0011 SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO DAY
8297-275156-0012 HE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THIS EVENING
8297-275156-0013 BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE COUNT'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERINE'S REPLY
84-121123-0000 GO TO YOU HEAR
84-121123-0001 BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE BASKET GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT
84-121123-0002 AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTRED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE IT BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY
84-121123-0003 AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN THE SILENCE
84-121123-0004 D'VERNIE RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE
84-121123-0005 D'VERNIY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN
84-121123-0006 FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATION AND PRAYERS
84-121123-0007 WHAT DO YE MEAN SIR
84-121123-0008 OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVOURING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKING I RAVE
84-121123-0009 DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED ORREL
84-121123-0010 NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPIER AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION
84-121123-0011 SAID MARREL SADLY YES REPLIED NOIRTIER
84-121123-0012 THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED ON THE DOORS
84-121123-0013 ASKED MORREL YET
84-121123-0014 MIGHT I LEAVE ALONE NO
84-121123-0015 BUT CAN HE UNDERSTAND YOU HERE
84-121123-0016 GENTLEMAN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOR EVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK
84-121123-0017 MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP IT SECRET DO YOU NOT FATHER
84-121123-0018 MORREL SHOUTED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM
84-121123-0019 THE OLD MAN GAVE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
84-121123-0020 IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF COIRTIER WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS
84-121123-0021 THEN HE STOPPED ON THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER
84-121123-0022 THE DOCTORS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE
84-121123-0023 NOIRTIER WAS NEAR HER BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE
84-121123-0024 THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET THAT WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JUST UNCLOSED THE LIPS
84-121123-0025 THE NEAREST SAID THE DISTRICT DOCTOR IS A GOOD ITALIAN ABBE WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU SHALL I CALL HIM AS I PASS
84-121123-0026 D'AUVERIGNY SAID VILLEFORT BE SO KIND I BESEECH YOU AS TO ACCOMPANY THIS GENTLEMAN HERE IS THE KEY OF THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND OUT AS YOU PLEASE YOU WILL BRING THE PRIEST WITH YOU AND WILL OBLIGE ME BY INTRODUCING HIM TO MY CHILD'S ROOM DO YOU WISH TO SEE HIM
84-121123-0027 I ONLY WISHES TO BE ALONE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME WILL YOU NOT
84-121123-0028 I AM GOING SIR AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PRAYERS MAY BE MORE FERVENT THAN MINE
84-121550-0000 BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING REPEATED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHYMES
84-121550-0001 ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LIMPID ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES ANY MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL
84-121550-0002 THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PROSERPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AS SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
84-121550-0003 I DO NOT THINK THERE HUNG SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM
84-121550-0004 WE ARE NEW COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE PERADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST
84-121550-0005 SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELING BUT THE PSALM DELECTAS GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOUD YOUR INTELLECT
84-121550-0006 THE GOOD SUPREME SOUL IN ITSELF DELIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HASTEEL OF ETERNAL PEACE
84-121550-0007 BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SOJOURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE FORMED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY
84-121550-0008 THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOUR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I AVAIL TO THEE NO MORE
84-121550-0009 BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WAS NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
84-121550-0010 NO EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
84-121550-0011 NOW HELICAON MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR URANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK
84-121550-0012 THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCED BY YOUNG WEDDED BRIDES
84-121550-0013 AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DELIAS'S GIRDLE
84-121550-0014 THESE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTERMOST
84-121550-0015 THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THOSE FOUR CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
84-121550-0016 NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR E'ER GLADDENED HYRCANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WILL BE
84-121550-0017 THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT AT THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED
84-121550-0018 THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THREE APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN
84-121550-0019 IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO YOUNG MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GAIT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
84-121550-0020 AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THE FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERDITED
84-121550-0021 AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VENI SPONSA DE LIBINO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER
84-121550-0022 AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH ERE FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAVE YET COME FORTH
84-121550-0023 WITH THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED
84-121550-0024 TO SAY UNTO VIRGILIUS NOT A DRACHM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME IT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
84-121550-0025 DANTES BECAUSE VIRGILIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET A WHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEEDS MUST WEEP
84-121550-0026 I SAW THE LADY WHO EREWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME CROSS THE RIVER
84-121550-0027 LOOK ON ME WELL IN SOOTH I'M BEATRICE
84-121550-0028 YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES TAKE UPON THEIR PATH
84-121550-0029 THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SON AND DOLE BE OF ONE MEASURE
84-121550-0030 BUT TO THE LARGENESS OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR REIGN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT
84-121550-0031 AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE ITSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS
84-121550-0032 SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALWAYS SHORT SAVE SHEWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PERDITION
84-121550-0033 CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED CEASED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
84-121550-0034 WHENCE HE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO
84-121550-0035 AND WHAT ALLUREMENTS AND WHAT VANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHERS SHOWED THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM
8842-302196-0000 HE TRANSLATED AT AN EARLY AGE CHIEFLY BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE AND EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE A GREAT NUMBER OF POEMS BY THE ITALIANS CONTEMPORARY WITH DANTE OR PRECEDING HIM AND AMONG OTHER THINGS HE MADE A VERSION OF THE WHOLE VITANOAVA PROSE AND VERSE
8842-302196-0001 THIS BOOK IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOUR AND SETTLED THE CLAIM OF ROSSETTI TO RANK AS A POETIC TRANSLATOR OR INDEED AS THE POET IN HIS OWN RIGHT
8842-302196-0002 THE LIFEBLOOD OF RHYTHMICAL TRANSLATION IS THE COMMANDMENT THAT A GOOD POEM SHALL NOT BE TURNED INTO A BAD ONE
8842-302196-0003 THE ONLY TRUE MOTIVE FOR PUTTING POETRY INTO A FRENCH LANGUAGE MUST BE TO ENDOW A FRESH NATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITH ONE MORE POSSESSION OF BEAUTY
8842-302196-0004 POETRY NOT BEING AN EXACT SCIENCE LITERALITY AND RENDERING IS ALTOGETHER SECONDARY TO THIS CHIEF LAW
8842-302196-0005 OFTEN WOULD HE AVAIL HIMSELF OF ANY SPECIAL GRACE OF HIS OWN IDIOM AND EPOCH IF ONLY HIS WILL BELONGED TO HIM OFTEN WOULD SOME CADENCE SERVE HIM BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S OWN STRUCTURE SOME STRUCTURE BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S CADENCE OFTEN THE BEAUTIFUL TURN OF HIS STANZA MUST BE WEAKENED TO ADOPT SOME RHYME WHICH WILL TALLY AND HE SEES THE POET REVELING IN ABUNDANCE OF LANGUAGE WHERE HIMSELF IS SCANTILY SUPPLIED
8842-302196-0006 AND IF YOU HAVE TIME IT WOULD BE OF GREAT SERVICE TO TRANSLATE THE ANALYSES OF THE POEM WHICH I OMITTED
8842-302196-0007 ON JANUARY TWENTY FIRST HE WROTE MANY AND MANY THANKS FOR A MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICE MOST THOROUGHLY PERFORMED
8842-302196-0008 MY NOTES WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE IN REVISING ARE OF COURSE QUITE PALTRY AND USELESS
8842-302196-0009 IT IS THEREFORE AND ON ALL ACCOUNTS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MUCH MORE OF THE WORK HERE THAN IT SAYS OF ITSELF
8842-302196-0010 THROUGHOUT THE VITA NUUAVA THERE IS A STRAIN LIKE THE FIRST FALLING MURMUR WHICH REACHES THE EAR IN SOME REMOTE MEADOW AND PREPARES US TO LOOK UPON THE SEA
8842-302196-0011 A WORDS SHOULD BE SAID HERE OF THE TITLE OF DANTE'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY
8842-302196-0012 THIS HAS INDUCED SOME EDITORS OF THE VITA NUISA TO EXPLAIN THE TITLE AS MEANING EARLY LIFE
8842-302201-0000 THEREAFTER THIS SONNET BRED IN ME A DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN IN VERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST
8842-302201-0001 WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT IS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DIVERSE TIMES IN MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY
8842-302201-0002 BUT WHEN I STILL SPAKE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO WHAT END LOVEST THOU HIS LADY SEEING THAT THOU CANST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE
8842-302201-0003 AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER AND HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL MY BEATITUDE THERE WHERE MY HOPE WILL NOT FAIL ME
8842-302201-0004 THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOW FALL IN THE RAIN SO WAS THEIR TALK MINGLED WITH SIGHS
8842-302201-0005 AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE SHEDS SUCH PERFECT SWEETNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAILED NOT CERTAINLY TO HIM MY LISTENERS MUST BE ALL DESIGNED
8842-302201-0006 WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE DO ISSUE THENCE IN FLAME WHICH THROUGH THEIR EYES WHO THEN MAY LOOK ON THEM PIERCE TO THE HEART'S DEEP CHAMBERS EVERY ONE
8842-302201-0007 TO HER I WEND ALONG ON WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS IS MADE STRONG
8842-302201-0008 SO TO THE ROAD THOU SHALT BE RECONCILED AND FIND THE LADY AND WITH THE LADIES LOVE
8842-302201-0009 THE SECOND BEGINS THERE AN ANGEL THE THIRD HERE DEAR SONG I KNOW
8842-302201-0010 THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTO FOURTH
8842-302201-0011 IN THE THIRD I SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPEDED BY FAINTNESS
8842-302201-0012 ON THE FOURTH REPEATING TO WHOM I PURPOSED SPEAKING I TELL THE REASON WHY I SPEAK TO THEM
8842-302201-0013 IN THIS SECOND I TELL WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER ON EARTH HERE MY LADY IS DESIRED
8842-302201-0014 THE SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE FIRST I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER SOUL RELATING SOME OF HER VIRTUES PROCEEDING FROM HER SOUL IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER BODY NARRATING SOME OF HER BEAUTIES HERE LOVE SAITH CONCERNING
8842-302201-0015 THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE ONE I SPEAK OF THE EYES WHICH ARE THE BEGINNING OF LOVE IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF THE MOUTH WHICH WAS THE END OF LOVE
8842-302203-0000 AND AT THE FIRST IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I SAW CERTAIN FACES OF WOMEN WITH THEIR HAIR LOOSENED WHICH CALLED OUT TO ME THOU SHALT SURELY DIE AFTER THE WHICH OTHER TERRIBLE AND UNKNOWN APPEARANCES SAID UNTO ME THOU ART DEAD
8842-302203-0001 AND SO STRONG WAS MY FANTASY THAT I WEPT AGAIN IN VERY TRUTH AND SAID WITH MY TRUE VOICE O EXCELLENT SOUL HOW BLESSED IS HE THAT NOW LOOKEST UPON THEE
8842-302203-0002 WHEREBY OTHER LADIES WHO WERE ABOUT THE ROOM BECOMING AWARE OF MY DISCOMFORT BY REASON OF THE MOAN THAT SHE MADE WHO INDEED WAS OF MY VERY NEAR KINDRED LED HER AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS AND THEY SET THEMSELVES TO AWAKEN ME THINKING THAT I DREAMED AND SAYING SLEEP NO LONGER AND BE NOT DISQUIETED
8842-302203-0003 WHEN BEING AROUSED I OPENED MINE EYES I KNEW THAT IT HAD BEEN A DECEPTION
8842-302203-0004 AND MY HUE WAS SUCH THAT THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THOUGHT OF DEATH SAYING UNDER THEIR BREATH MOST TENDERLY AH LET US COMFORT HIM THEN UNTO ME WHAT DREAM WAS THINE THAT IT HATH SHAKEN THEE SO MUCH
8842-302203-0005 AND THEREWITHAL SUCH A BEWILDERMENT POSSESSED ME THAT I SHUT MINE EYES FOR PEACE AND IN MY BRAIN DID CEASED ORDER OF THOUGHT AND EVERY HEALTHFUL THING
8842-302203-0006 THEN SAW I MANY BROKEN HINTED RIGHTS IN THE UNCERTAIN STATE I STEPPED INTO
8842-302203-0007 THESE WULDERING FANTASIES THEN CARRIED ME TO SEE MY LADY DEAD
8842-302203-0008 THIS SECOND PART BEGINS HERE I WAS A THINKING THE FIRST PART DIVIDES INTO TWO
8842-302203-0009 THIS LADY'S RIGHT NAME WAS JOAN BUT BECAUSE OF HER COMELINESS OR AT LEAST IT WAS SO IMAGINED SHE WAS CALLED OF MANY PRIMA VERRA SPRING AND WENT BY THAT NAME AMONG THEM
8842-302203-0010 AND IN HIS SPEECH HE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AGAIN THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE TO REMAIN I CHANCED TO LOOK THE WAY HE HAD DRAWN NEAR AND SAW THE LADIES JOAN AND BEATRICE APPROACH ME THIS THE OTHER FOLLOWING ONE AND A SECOND NOVEL INSTANTLY
8842-302203-0011 THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE SAYING BIN THE THIRD HERE THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE

8842-304647-0003 THIS WORLD'S THICK VAPOURS WHELM YOUR EYES UNWORTHY OF THAT GLORIOUS SHOW BLIND TO HIS SPLENDOR BENT UPON HIS FAME
8842-304647-0004 MONEY IS FALSE AND LIGHT UNLESS IT BE BOUGHT BY A MAN'S OWN WORTHY QUALITIES AND BLOOD IS SUCH THAT THE CORRUPT DISEASE AND IGNORANT PRETENCE ARE FOUL TO SEE
8842-304647-0005 I POPOLO UN ABESTIA
8842-304647-0006 THE PEOPLE IS A BEAST OF MUDDY BRAIN THAT KNOWS NOT ITS OWN FORCE AND THEREFORE STANDS LOADED WITH WOOD AND STONE THE POWERLESS HAND OF A MERE CHILD GUIDE IT WITH BIT AND REIN ONE KICK WOULD BE ENOUGH TO BREAK THE CHAIN BUT THE BEAST FEARS AND WHAT THE CHILD DEMANDS IT DOES NOR ITS OWN TERROR UNDERSTANDS CONFUSED AND STUPEFIED BY BUGBEAR'S VEIN
8842-304647-0007 MORE WONDERFUL
8842-304647-0008 THAT PENANCE HATH NO SHAME WHICH MAGDALEN FOUND SWEET PURGING OUR SHAME SELF PUNISHMENT IS VIRTUE ALL MEN KNOW
8842-304647-0009 ORGAN OF RUT NOT REASON IS THE LORD WHO FROM THE BODY POLITIC DOTH DRAIN LUST FROM HIMSELF INSTEAD OF TOIL AND PAIN LEAVING US LENA'S CRICKETS ON DRY SWARD
8842-304647-0010 WELL TOO IF HE LIKE LOVE WOULD FILCH OUR HOARD WITH PLEASURE TO OURSELVES SLUICING OUR VEIN IN VIGOR TO PERPETUATE THE STRAIN OF LIFE BY SPILTH OF LIFE WITHIN US STORED
