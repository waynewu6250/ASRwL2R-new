1272-128104-0000 MISTER QUILTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS DISCIPLE
1272-128104-0001 NOR IS MISTER QUILTED'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MADDER
1272-128104-0002 HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CHRISTMAS AND ROAST BEEF LOOMING BEFORE US SIMILES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OCCUR ALMOST READILY TO THE MIND
1272-128104-0003 HE HAS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FREDERIC LEYTON'S WORK IS REALLY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT A LITTLE OF ROCKY ITHACA
1272-128104-0004 LINENELL'S PICTURES ARE A SORT OF UPGUARDS AND ADAM PAINTINGS AND MASON'S EXQUISITE IDYLLS ARE AS NATIONAL AS A JINGO POEM MISTER BURKETT FOSTER'S LANDSCAPES SMILE AT ONE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT MISTER PARKER USED TO FLASH HIS TEETH AND MISTER JOHN COLLIER GIVES HIS SITTER A CHEERFUL SLAP ON THE BACK BEFORE HE SAYS LIKE A SHAMPOOER IN A TURKISH BATH NEXT MAN
1272-128104-0005 IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LUMINOUS THESE CRITICISMS ARE HOW DELICATE IN EXPRESSION ARE
1272-128104-0006 ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART MISTER QUINTTER WRITES WITH EQUAL LUCIDITY
1272-128104-0007 PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MATHEMATICS AND FINISH IN ART IS ADDING MORE PAINT
1272-128104-0008 AS FOR ETCHINGS THEY ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND FOREIGNE
1272-128104-0009 THAT HE LAMENTS MOST BITTERLY THE DIVORCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DECORATIVE ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKES A CUSTOMARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND REMINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHAEL ANGELO WAS THE FURNISHING UPHOLSTERER
1272-128104-0010 NEAR THE FIRE AND THE ORNAMENTS FRED BROUGHT HOME FROM INDIA ON THE MENTALBOARD
1272-128104-0011 IN FACT HE IS VERY SEVERE ON MISTER RUSKIN FOR NOT RECOGNISING THAT A PICTURE SHOULD DENOTE THE FRAILTY OF MAN AND REMARKS WITH PLEASING COURTESY AND FELICITOUS GRACE THAT MANY PHASES OF FEELING
1272-128104-0012 ONLY UNFORTUNATELY HIS OWN WORK EVER DOES GET GOOD
1272-128104-0013 MISTER QUILTER HAS MISSED HIS CHANCE AND HE HAS FAILED EVEN TO MAKE HIMSELF THE TUPPER OF PAINTING
1272-128104-0014 BY HARRY QUILTA M A
1272-135031-0000 BECAUSE YOU ARE SLEEPING INSTEAD OF CONQUERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAS BECOME A FIDDLE WITHOUT A BOW WHILE POOR SHAGGY SITS IN A COOING DOVE
1272-135031-0001 HE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED POLYCHROME WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEEZE INTO THAT ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCES WITH MUCH INTEREST
1272-135031-0002 I HAVE REMAINED A PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO BE ONE AND FROM THIS HE STEPPED FORWARD AND BURST THE STOUT CHAINS AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THREADS
1272-135031-0003 THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP THEN SHE HEARD THE RAPS AND OPENED THE DOOR
1272-135031-0004 A KING HAS FLED IN DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU
1272-135031-0005 I BEGGED RUGGEDO LONG AGO TO SEND YOU AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO
1272-135031-0006 I ALSO OFFERED TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE IF HE WOULD NOT GO
1272-135031-0007 HE EATS AND SLEEPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW PRINCE
1272-135031-0008 I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID JULIA
1272-135031-0009 HE DOESN'T THINK AT ALL
1272-135031-0010 IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO OF THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS OUR GNOMES WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WORRIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY
1272-135031-0011 NOT EXACTLY RETURNED KAIKO
1272-135031-0012 WHO IS MY BROTHER NOW
1272-135031-0013 INQUIRED SHAGGY IN THE METAL FORESTER
1272-135031-0014 HERE IS THAT
1272-135031-0015 THE MIDDLE FORESTS IS IN THE GREAT DOMED CAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED KALIKO
1272-135031-0016 KARLIGO HESITATED
1272-135031-0017 HOWEVER IF WE LOOK SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF OUR SECRET WAYS
1272-135031-0018 OH NO I'M QUITE SURE SHE DIDN'T
1272-135031-0019 THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED BETSEY
1272-135031-0020 I DON'T BELIEVE DAN KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SHE'D HAVE WORKED IT BEFORE
1272-135031-0021 I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHAGGY AND
1272-135031-0022 TRUE AGREED KALEKO
1272-135031-0023 KALIKO WENT TO THE BIG GONG AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS RUGGEDO USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED TO THE SUMMONS
1272-135031-0024 HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN KALIKO FIRST POUNDED THE GONGS AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RUGGEDO'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGGEDO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD
1272-141231-0000 A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I EXISTS
1272-141231-0001 SWEAT COVERED BRIEN'S BODY TRICKLING INTO THE TIGHT LOIN CLOTH THAT WAS THE ONLY GARMENT HE WORE
1272-141231-0002 THE CUT ON HIS BREAST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVERSTRAINED EYES EVEN THE SOARING ARENA AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
1272-141231-0003 HIS INSTANT OF PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW BACK ON HIS CHEST
1272-141231-0004 ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND THE TIME BUZZING SOUNDED
1272-141231-0005 A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY NEEDED EVERY FRACTIONS OF IT
1272-141231-0006 THE BUZZER'S WHIRR TRIGGED HIS MUSCLES INTO COMPLETE RELAXATION
1272-141231-0007 ONLY HIS HEART AND LUNGS WORKED ON AT THAT STRONG MEASURED RATE
1272-141231-0008 HE WAS IN REVERY SLIDING ON THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
1272-141231-0009 THE CONTESTANTS IN THE TWENTIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS IN THE DORMITORIES ARE AS QUIET AS DEATH
1272-141231-0010 PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICLES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF THOSE STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS
1272-141231-0011 THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A HARSH URGENCY CLEARLY USED FOR COMMAND
1272-141231-0012 I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRANDT IS THE ONE I MUST SEE NOW STAND ASIDE
1272-141231-0013 THE TWENTIES IT
1272-141231-0014 HE MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRUDER SAID QUICKLY PUT THAT AWAY YOU'R BEING A FOOL OUT
1272-141231-0015 THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING BRION WAS ONCE MORE SLEEP
1272-141231-0016 IN TEN SECONDS
1272-141231-0017 HE SAID THE HANDLER WHO WAS KNEADING HIS ACHING MUSCLES
1272-141231-0018 A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WITH AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF COURAGE
1272-141231-0019 THERE COULD BE LITTLE ACT IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OF FENCING
1272-141231-0020 JUST THRUST AND PARRY AND VICTORY OF THE STRONGER
1272-141231-0021 EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED OF THE TWENTIES HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRICKS
1272-141231-0022 THERE APPEARED TO ME AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEATH DRAMA AS IF THE TWO WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED INTO ONE
1272-141231-0023 THE STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOME ONE IN A TRANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT ON TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS
1272-141231-0024 THIS IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONTRARY
1272-141231-0025 OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING THE TWENTIES AND DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN FATE
1272-141231-0026 BREATHING DEEPLY BRION SOFTLY SPOKE THE AUTOP HYPNOTIC PHRASES THAT TRIGGERED THE PROCESSES
1272-141231-0027 WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FOIL FROM HIS SECOND'S STARTLED GRASP AND RUN FORWARD
1272-141231-0028 AUROLA LOOKED AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED
1272-141231-0029 HE THOUGHT IT WAS A LOUD BURST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSE THEY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION
1272-141231-0030 BRION SAW SOMETHING CLOSE TO PANIC ON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE AND THE MAN FINALLY RECOGNISED HIS ERROR
1272-141231-0031 A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM AEROLLOG BRION SENSED IT AND KNEW THE FIFTH POINT WAS HIS
1272-141231-0032 THEN THE POWERFUL TWISTS THAT THRUST IT ASIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD
1462-170138-0000 HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF ERNEST DAWSON ET CETERA A
1462-170138-0001 HUGH'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL BOOK FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPRESSIBLE
1462-170138-0002 I HAPPEN TO HAVE MC CONAIL'S BOX FOR TO NIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
1462-170138-0003 OH ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED MILDLY
1462-170138-0004 MY SELF I ALWAYS KNEW SHE HAD IT IN HER
1462-170138-0005 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER BAYNE HALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP IN THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISMS SERIOUSLY MYSELF
1462-170138-0006 WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGEBOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE SCENE BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
1462-170138-0007 AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDER'S ATTENTION TO THE STATUE
1462-170138-0008 OF COURSE HILDA IS IRISH THOUGH BURGOINS HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
1462-170138-0009 IT'S LIKE TO HEAR IT IN A LONDON THEATRE
1462-170138-0010 WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GAWSOONS WHICH SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR
1462-170138-0011 AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THAT DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF PHILLY'S BOROUGH WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PRIMROSES FOR HER DONKEY
1462-170138-0012 MC CONALL LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BARTLEY ELEANOR
1462-170138-0013 THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MAIN HALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET SHADE EYES AND MADE A WRY FACE
1462-170138-0014 HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DODGING AGAINSTS AS HE WENT
1462-170138-0015 I DARE SAY THAT'S QUITE TRUE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ONE ELSE
1462-170138-0016 HE'S IN ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
1462-170138-0017 SIR HARRY TOWNS BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKYO
1462-170138-0018 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GETTING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
1462-170138-0019 THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEEDY MY POOR CHILD
1462-170138-0020 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY I
1462-170138-0021 HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAINHALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WESTMIRE OF COURSE THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GREY MOUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOWELL
1462-170138-0022 IN A MOMENT PEGGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLAUDED VIGOROUSLY TO THE REST
1462-170138-0023 IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH AN AMUSEMENT SIR HARRY'S JUDICIAL FROWN
1462-170138-0024 HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAMED FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAYONHALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT
1462-170138-0025 ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HELDA
1462-170138-0026 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SAID
1462-170138-0027 IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND CHILD
1462-170142-0000 THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGES BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
1462-170142-0001 EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BARFORD SQUARE
1462-170142-0002 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED A CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UP STAIRS
1462-170142-0003 HER ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
1462-170142-0004 A SMALL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
1462-170142-0005 SHE CALLED A NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
1462-170142-0006 SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SIDE
1462-170142-0007 I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BATLEY
1462-170142-0008 AND WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
1462-170142-0009 SHE LOOKED AT HER HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
1462-170142-0010 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLE SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
1462-170142-0011 I PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
1462-170142-0012 HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADES GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
1462-170142-0013 IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE NOT IT
1462-170142-0014 ALWAYS BUT IT'S FRESH NOW
1462-170142-0015 IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME A MINUTE
1462-170142-0016 I I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
1462-170142-0017 I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF ONE
1462-170142-0018 THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND THIS THING
1462-170142-0019 AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SOME SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIP LASH
1462-170142-0020 SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HIM
1462-170142-0021 COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTIE AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
1462-170142-0022 HE DROPPED BACK RAPIDLY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE
1462-170142-0023 I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL TILL I AM WORN OUT
1462-170142-0024 I AFTER THE VERY FIRST
1462-170142-0025 HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED WHILE SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
1462-170142-0026 SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN FOR ALL
1462-170142-0027 SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER MORE
1462-170142-0028 PRESENTLY IT STOOD BACK TO HIS COAT SLEEVE
1462-170142-0029 YES HILDA I KNOW THEN HE SAID SIMPLY
1462-170142-0030 I UNDERSTAND BRETLEY I WAS WRONG
1462-170142-0031 SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE SAW NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
1462-170142-0032 YOU WANT ME TO SAY WHAT SHE WHISPERED
1462-170142-0033 BARTLA LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
1462-170142-0034 IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILTA
1462-170142-0035 OH MARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
1462-170142-0036 YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM ME BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
1462-170142-0037 I WILL HEAR THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
1462-170142-0038 HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER ARMS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
1462-170142-0039 YOU SEE LOVING SO ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
1462-170142-0040 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARED VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
1462-170142-0041 SHE LAID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
1462-170142-0042 DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE SAID
1462-170145-0000 ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE IN WEST TENTH STREET
1462-170145-0001 OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A DARK OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR
1462-170145-0002 HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROAD QUICKLY
1462-170145-0003 OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OWE HIM THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY
1462-170145-0004 I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHAT YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
1462-170145-0005 LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THOUGH OOZING WATER
1462-170145-0006 IF YE'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONE TO ME OR ANYTHING
1462-170145-0007 I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF HIM AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
1462-170145-0008 THEY PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME
1462-170145-0009 OH BARTLEY DID YOU WRITE FOR ME
1462-170145-0010 SIR ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
1462-170145-0011 I THINK I HAVE FELT WHAT YOU WERE COMING
1462-170145-0012 HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER FINGER
1462-170145-0013 AND NOW SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT
1462-170145-0014 BUT WHEN I CAME BACK I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
1462-170145-0015 I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD COME
1462-170145-0016 THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED THREE MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED
1462-170145-0017 I'RE GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON
1462-170145-0018 ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE PROPERLY
1462-170145-0019 THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
1462-170145-0020 YES I THINK VERY WELL
1462-170145-0021 ALEXANDER FLUSTERED ANGRILY
1462-170145-0022 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AREN'T YOU TRYING TO LIGHTEN ME
1673-143396-0000 A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOUR OF THE FIRST PROSELYTE HAS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE AND WISH THAT THE EBIONITES OR AT LEAST THE NAZARENES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAIC RITES
1673-143396-0001 THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT AFFORD A LATITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFANT CREED WOULD BE VARIOUSLY MOLDED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
1673-143396-0002 NOW THE MOST CHARITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THESE SECTARIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0003 HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASE IN STATURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A WONDERFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS
1673-143396-0004 HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRATES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAIN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF THIS HUMANITY
1673-143396-0005 THE SON OF A VIRGIN GENERATED BY THE INEFFABLE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF
1673-143396-0006 NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THESE AEONS THE LOGOS OR WORDS OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
1673-143396-0007 BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE AUTHORITY AND INHERENT PRIVITY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST
1673-143396-0008 MANY AMONG THE GENTILE PROSELYTES REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A CELESTIAL SPIRIT AN UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY CONNECTED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY ABJURED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST
1673-143396-0009 HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OMNIPOTENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL RESOLUTION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
1673-143396-0010 BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOCENTS WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST WAS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE BODY
1673-143396-0011 A PHOEBUS THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD'S THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXISTENCE WITHOUT REPAIRING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
1673-143396-0012 IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NAZARETH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MARY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENTS TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THIS TRUE AND SUPREME DEITY
1673-143396-0013 WHEN THE MESSIAH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE CHRIST AN IMMORTAL AND IMPASSABLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE PLEASMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE
1673-143396-0014 BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTIONS ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FATE OF AN INNOCENT MARTYR AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFANE
1673-143396-0015 THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTARIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED A DOUBLE SYSTEM OF CORINTHUS
1673-143396-0016 THE WORTHY FRIEND OF ATHANASIUS A WORTHY ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY WRESTLED WITH THE ARIANS AND POLYTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE EFFECTED THE RIGOR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITERAL AND ALLEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES
1673-143396-0017 NOW AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED AT HIS OWN RASHNESS APOLLINARIS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLANATION
1673-143396-0018 HE ACQUIESCED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND SENSITIVE SOUL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LOGOS FOR INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPLE OF THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE
1673-143396-0019 BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALLIANCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WE STILL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANTIAL INDISSOLUBLE AND EVERLASTING UNION OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY WITH A REASONABLE SOUL AND HUMAN FACE

1673-143397-0018 AT THE SAME TIME EVERY AVENUE OF THE THRONES WAS ASSAULTED WITH GOLD
1673-143397-0019 THE PAST HE REGRETTED HE WAS DISCONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE HE HAD REASON TO DREAD THE ORIENTAL BISHOPS SUCCESSIVELY DISENGAGED THEIR CAUSE FROM HIS UNPOPULAR NAME AND EACH DAY DECREASED THE NUMBER OF THE SCHISMATICS WHO REVERED NESTORIUS AS THE CONFESSOR OF THAT FAITH
1673-143397-0020 A WANDERING TRIBE OF THE BLEMAIDS OR NUBIANS INVADED HIS SOLITARY PRISON IN THEIR RETREAT THEY DISMISSED A CROWD OF USELESS CAPTIVES BUT NO SOONER HAD NASTARIUS REACHED THE BANKS OF THE NILE THAN HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE ESCAPED FROM A ROMAN AND ORTHODOX CITY TO THE MILDER SERVITUDE OF THE SAVAGES
174-168635-0000 HE HAD NEVER BEEN FATHER LOVER HUSBAND FRIEND FRIEND
174-168635-0001 THE HEART OF THAT EX CONVICT WAS FULL OF VIRGINION
174-168635-0002 HIS SISTER AND HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN HAD LEFT HIM ONLY A VAGUE AND FAR OFF MEMORY WHICH HAD FINALLY ALMOST COMPLETELY VANISHED HE HAD MADE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND THEM AND NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM HE HAD FORGOTTEN

174-168635-0004 ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND FIFTY AND COSETTE EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED AWAY INTO A SORT OF INEFFABLE LIGHT
174-168635-0005 COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD ALSO UNKNOWN TO HERSELF BECOME ANOTHER BEING POOR LITTLE GIRL

174-168635-0009 TO MEET WAS TO FIND THE OTHER
174-168635-0010 WHEN THESE TWO SOULS PERCEIVED EACH OTHER THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER AND EMBRACED EACH OTHER MORE CLOSELY
174-168635-0011 MOREOVER JEAN VALJEAN HAD CHOSEN HIS REFUGE BUT
174-168635-0012 HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSIONED THE OLD WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER AND THE DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN

174-168635-0020 ALAS HE WALKED WITH NO LESS INDECISIONS THAN COSETTE

174-84280-0015 SHE WAS DESTROYED NOT MERELY BY THE UNCONSIDERED UNDISCIPLINED PASSIONS OF HER HUSBAND AND HER LOVER BUT BY THE VAST VARIETY THAT SUSTAINS AND ENFORCES THE SUBJUGATION OF HER SEX

1988-147956-0027 AFTER ANTONIA HAD SAID THE TRUE WORDS OVER AND OVER SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE CHASTE SILVER RING WHICH SHE WORE ON HER MIDDLE FINGER
1988-147956-0028 WHEN I CAME UP YOU TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY DOWN INTO MY FACE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS
1988-147956-0029 I BECAME SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED FOR I WAS USED TO BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY HIS ELDERS
1988-148538-0000 IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BURSTS OF TUMULTUOUS AND BOISTEROUS GAIETY WHICH SHAKE ALL AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES OF DEMOCRACIES ARE NOT FOND OF BEING THUS VIOLENTLY BROKEN IN UPON AND THEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELVES WITHOUT REGRET
1988-148538-0001 AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEISURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESORT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUE TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME IN DRINK
1988-148538-0002 I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISES PARTLY FROM HIS PRIDE
1988-148538-0003 THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMMUNISTS
1988-148538-0004 THEN THERE ARE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY ACQUISITION OF THE PRIVATE FORTUNE
1988-148538-0005 I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCRACIES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LATTER EXCEPT THEIR OWN
1988-148538-0006 IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH HE UNCEASINGLY PURSUES BUT AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE SUBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH
1988-148538-0007 CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE ITALIANS IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTIOUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
1988-148538-0008 THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIENT OF THEIR SMALLEST CENSURE AND INSATIABLE OF PRAISE
1988-148538-0009 IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY HE LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE AYE HE REPLIES THERE IS NOT SOME FELLOW IN THE WORLD
1988-148538-0010 IF I APPLAUD THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITANTS ENJOY HE ANSWERS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW MAIDENS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT
1988-148538-0011 IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE GREAT POSSESS IMMENSE PRIVILEGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ACCRUE WITH THEM
1988-148538-0012 THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF VAUNTING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERY ONE PERCEIVES AND NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEW FOR THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION
1988-148538-0013 THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WOULD ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
1988-148538-0014 WHEN AN ARISTOCRACY CARRIES ON PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HAUGHTY FORM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE NATIONS
1988-148538-0015 THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PUERILE JEALOUSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MEN OF THE DEMOCRACIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEIR EQUALS CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PARADE OSTENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSSESSION
1988-24833-0000 THE OTHER STRAY KITTENS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME
1988-24833-0001 SOMEHOW OR OTHER NAT HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE'S IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHASES THEM FOR FUN NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY SLEEPING
1988-24833-0002 SHE DOESN'T PICK HIM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN THE ROOM SHE DOESN'T GIVE HER ASTHMA
1988-24833-0003 WHEN WERE YOU GETTING RID OF THESE CATS I'M NOT FIXING TO START AN ANNEX TO KATE'S CAT HOME
1988-24833-0004 RIGHT AWAY WHEN I BRING HOME MY NEW PROGRAMME HE SAYS HOW COME YOU'RE TAKING ONE LESS COURSE THE HALF

1988-24833-0008 THEY'LL BE LUCKY IF I HAVE TIME TO BREATHE
1988-24833-0009 SOMETIMES SCHOOLS DO LET KIDS TAKE A LOT OF SOFT COURSES AND THEN THEY'RE OUT ON A LIMB LATER EH
1988-24833-0010 SO HE CARES HUM EH
1988-24833-0011 BESIDES SAYS TOM HALF THE REASON YOU AND YOUR FATHER ARE ALWAYS BICKERING IS THAT YOU'RE SO MUCH ALIKE ME LIKE YOU SURE
1988-24833-0012 AS LONG AS THERE'S A BONE ON THE FLOOR THE TWO OF YOU MARRY IT
1988-24833-0013 I GET THE PILLOW'S COMFORTABLY ARRANGED ON THE FLOOR WITH A BIG BOTTLE OF SODA AND A BAG OF POP CORN WITHIN EASY REACH
1988-24833-0014 POP GOES RIGHT ON TUNING HIS CHEST
1988-24833-0015 YOU'RE GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO UPSET AT THESE PROGRAMMES STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSELF
1988-24833-0016 IT'S YOUR FAULT MOP IT ON YOURSELF
1988-24833-0017 I HEAR THE TEVIES GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POP TURNS IT OFF AND GOES IN THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO MOM
1988-24833-0018 WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURN A GUY'S TEABY PROGRAMM OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT
1988-24833-0019 I LOOK IN MY WATCH IT'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
1988-24833-0020 I TURN ON THE TELEVISION SET I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRANDFATHER WHO'S A SPOOK AFTER ALL
1988-24833-0021 IT'S THE FIRST TIME HILDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER RIGHT
1988-24833-0022 I TOLD TOM WE SHOULDN'T COME SO LATE WAS HILDA
1988-24833-0023 TOM SAYS THANKS AND LOOKING AT HILDA AND SHE BLUSHES REALLY
1988-24833-0024 TOM DRINKS A LITTLE MORE COFFEE AND THEN HE GOES ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON THIS FLOWER SPOT JOB
1988-24833-0025 YOU MEAN I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANYWAY
1988-24833-0026 I'VE DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE FAMILY
1988-24833-0027 I'LL HAVE TO FIX SOME MORE SAYS TOM
1988-24833-0028 HERE'S TO YOU A WELL HAPPY LIFE
1993-147149-0000 HOW INFINITE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GARNERED IN THESE SAME TINY TREASURE HOUSES AND NOW
1993-147149-0001 WHAT BANKRUPTS ON THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORSELESS CREDITOR SEIZES ON ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINS
1993-147149-0002 THE GHOUL LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BALKED OF HIS PREY
1993-147149-0003 THE BOARD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOKE CLAYPOLE HER HUSBAND'S BUCKINGHAMSHIRE PARISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD ARRANGED TO PAY HER RENT
1993-147149-0004 MARGARET FOUND JEM WILSON SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME
1993-147149-0005 SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH OF THE WILSON'S DOOR TO STILL THE BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN
1993-147149-0006 SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATHLIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAUSE BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DISTURB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALICE LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWINS WHICH SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BOARD PLACED ON A SORT OF SOFA SETTEE IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM
1993-147149-0007 ABOVE THE CHILD WHICH YET BREATHED THE FATHER BENT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE
1993-147149-0008 IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THOUGHT YOU
1993-147149-0009 BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH IN HIS ARM WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UP STAIRS AS IF AFRAID OF WAKENING HIM
1993-147149-0010 WISHING HE SAID MARY IN A TONE OF INQUIRY
1993-147149-0011 THEN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP A VOICE AND WEPT
1993-147149-0012 OUR CRIES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS
1993-147149-0013 MARY AND ALICE DREW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN SILENT SORROW FOR SOME TIME
1993-147149-0014 THAT ALICE BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING
1993-147149-0015 AFORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FOLK COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD AN ALL YOU'N HEARD HOW I'VE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME
1993-147149-0016 BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STURDY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG ANXIETY
1993-147149-0017 OH JEM DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO YOU
1993-147149-0018 HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HAND'S TOUCH THRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR
1993-147149-0019 DON'T JEM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF FEELING
1993-147149-0020 MARY I ALMOST LOATHE MYSELF WHEN I FELT I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PAST AND GONE AND MARY AS SHE TRIED TO RELEASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLEST
1993-147149-0021 HE REMAINED UP STAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLIER DAWN SHOWED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED AND QUIET STREETS TO TRY AND GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR
1993-147149-0022 SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE ROBIN AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JEM AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
1993-147149-0023 HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JEM'S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THIS TALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY
1993-147149-0024 I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSSESSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE'S DOWNCAST AND THAT I MUST GO MEDDLING WITH HIM TO MORROW WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNT'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM
1993-147149-0025 I THINK I CAN NOT GO RIGHT FOR I EITHER CHECK MYSELF TILL I'M DOWNRIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NAT'RAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF
1993-147149-0026 SO WILL HE THANK ME FOR IT
1993-147149-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREWDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UNWORLDLY IDEAL SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SIMMONDS YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES
1993-147149-0028 THE OLD LEAVEN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNT ESTHER FERMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE WORSE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE
1993-147149-0029 IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOLDED BY MISS SIMMINS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM THE HASTY TEMPERED YET KIND DRESSMAKER
1993-147149-0030 BUT THE BEST OF THEIR PLANS THE HOLIEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DISHEARTENED GLOOMY PERSON
1993-147964-0000 THEY SAT ABOUT THAT HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GREASING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLAITING WHIPLASHES
1993-147964-0001 ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS SERVANTS TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIN
1993-147964-0002 I HAD WANTED TO HAVE SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YULKA AND ANTONIA EVEN YULKA WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW
1993-147964-0003 SHE CUT SQUARES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SEWED THEM TOGETHER TO A BOOK
1993-147964-0004 ON THE GREAT PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS AND ADVERTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
1993-147964-0005 WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SLUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRAND MOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME
1993-147964-0006 I HAD PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JAKE
1993-147964-0007 HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ME IN PHILADELPHIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
1993-147964-0008 BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE GIRL IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE
1993-147964-0009 FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLOURED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND ROUGH ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
1993-147964-0010 I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING AROUND THE TABLE IN THE LAMPLIGHT JAKE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RUDELY MOLDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UNFINISHED OTTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FEROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MOUSTACHE
1993-147965-0000 GRANDFATHER CAME IN WEARING A WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
1993-147965-0001 MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN THE USUAL
1993-147965-0002 HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITHOUT US
1993-147965-0003 BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USES
1993-147965-0004 ALL THAT AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM
1993-147965-0005 AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER SHIMERDA WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND HIS NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED
1993-147965-0006 HE SAT STILL AND PASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE OPEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
1993-147965-0007 HIS FACE WAS A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN
1993-147965-0008 HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OVER IN THE DARK
1993-147966-0000 THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A THAW AND BY NEW YEAR'S DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRAY SLUSH AND THE GUTTERED LOAF BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
1993-147966-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR APARTMENTS AND CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE
1993-147966-0002 YOUR MAMAN I SAID ANGRILY WANTS OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS
1993-147966-0003 FOR AMBROSCH MY MAMMA COME HERE
1993-147966-0004 BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRAITS POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN MEN
1993-147966-0005 THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BOISTEROUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME TRYING
1993-147966-0006 YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AS NO MISTAKE
2035-147960-0000 SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROTECTING MANNER
2035-147960-0001 THIS CHANGE CAME AROUND FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD TOGETHER
2035-147960-0002 ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE SHIMERDAS I FOUND ANTONIA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AMBROSCH NEEDEDS
2035-147960-0003 THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND LEADY AS WINE
2035-147960-0004 IT WAS ON ONE OF THEIR GRAVEL BEDS THAT I MET MY ADVENTURE
2035-147960-0005 I WHIRLED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVELLY BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD EVER SEEN
2035-147960-0006 I KNOW I'M JUST AS AWFUL JIM I WAS SO SCARED
2035-147960-0007 I NEVER KNOW YOU WAS SO BRAVE JIMMIE SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY
2035-147960-0008 A FAINT FETID SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF CLEAN LIQUID OOZED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD
2035-147960-0009 TAKE TONY THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID
2035-147960-0010 I EXPLAINED TO ANTONIA HOW THAT MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MAN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BUFFALO AND INDIAN TIMES
2035-147960-0011 THEY DECIDED THAT ANTONIA SHOULD RIDE DUDE HOME AND I WOULD WALK
2035-147960-0012 I FOLLOWED WITH THE SPADE OVER MY SHOULDER DRAGGING MY CAKE
2035-147960-0013 OTTO FUCHSUS WAS THE FIRST ONE WE MET
2035-147960-0014 HE COULD STAND RIGHT OUT AND TALK TO YOU HE COULD DID HE FIGHT HARD
2035-147960-0015 OTTO WINKT AT ME
2035-147960-0016 A SNAKE OF THIS SIZE IN FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOY COULD HANDLE
2035-147961-0000 PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER SHIMERDA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF DECEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONUS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE A MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW
2035-147961-0001 PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTA
2035-147961-0002 SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK THROUGH THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOUGHNUTS FOR US
2035-147961-0003 WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TOUCH
2035-147961-0004 THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOUR OF A NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
2035-147961-0005 THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN THEY WENT MOANING ON
2035-147961-0006 I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BEDS
2035-147961-0007 THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH A ROOM
2035-147961-0008 BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE
2035-147961-0009 THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIDDLE
2035-147961-0010 IT SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WHO HAD WRONGED HIM
2035-147961-0011 QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH LIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
2035-147961-0012 HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUPA
2035-147961-0013 ANTONIA'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY AND
2035-147961-0014 FROM A BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS
2035-147961-0015 GRADUALLY RELIEF GAVE TO ALL OF US
2035-147961-0016 WITHOUT A WORD PETER GOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN AND
2035-147961-0017 MISTER SHIMERDA WENT WITH HIM AND
2035-147961-0018 AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE FRIENDS OF THE BRIDE
2035-147961-0019 THE FIRST HOWLS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICKENING REPETITIONS OF
2035-147961-0020 A BLACK DROVE CAME ON OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WEDDING PARTY
2035-147961-0021 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE HINDMOST SLEDGE THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL HE WAS PROBABLY VERY DRUNK THE HORSES LEFT THE ROAD HIS SLEDGE WAS CAUGHT UP IN A CLUMP OF TREES AND OVERTURNED
2035-147961-0022 THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOWED MADE MARGUERITE SOBER
2035-147961-0023 THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AN THE GROOM'S THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND
2035-147961-0024 THERE ARE ONLY THE THREE SLEDGES LEFT HE WHISPERED
2035-147961-0025 AND THE WOLVES POBL ASKED ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US
2035-147961-0026 AND THEY WERE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILLAGE NOW
2035-147961-0027 YES HOW MANY I
2035-147961-0028 TWENTY THIRTY I
2035-147961-0029 NO HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO
2035-147961-0030 PAVEL KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SADDLE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER HIM
2035-147961-0031 BUT PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SEAT SAW NOTHING
2035-147961-0032 THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE THROUGH THE CLEAN AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS
2035-147961-0033 THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR LIVES
2035-147961-0034 WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STRANGER FOLLOWED THEM
2035-147961-0035 THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MOINES FORT WAING BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE
2035-147961-0036 DURING THE AUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER CLOSED HIS EYES
2035-147961-0037 EVERY ONE SAID THAT PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER
2035-147961-0038 THE LOSS OF THEIR TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SHIMERDA
2035-147961-0039 WHEN I WAS OUT HUNTING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EMPTY LOG HOUSE AND SIT THERE BROODING
2035-147961-0040 THIS CABIN WAS HIS HERMITAGE UNTIL THE WINTER SNOWS PENNING HIM IN HIS CAVE
2035-152373-0000 THROUGHOUT THIS CENTURY THE POWER OF THE CHURCH WAS CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND IS VISIBLE IN MANY IMPORTANT PAGES
2035-152373-0001 THE ANCESTORS OF THE PRESENT PRETENDER INGUL SURNAMED THE SQUINT EYED HAD TWICE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED THE LICENTIOUS BARDS WHEN UNDER THE BAN OF TARA AND HIS POPULARITY WITH THAT STILL POWERFUL ORDER WAS ONE PROP OF HIS AMBITION
2035-152373-0002 IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF DRUIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLAIN OF MOYAH
2035-152373-0003 THE POETS OF SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE DWELT MUCH IN DETAIL ON THE OCCURRENCES OF THIS MEMORABLEDAY
2035-152373-0004 LIKE THE TWO KINGS OF SPARTA THEY REARED JOINTLY DIVIDING BETWEEN THEM THE LABOURERS AND CARES OF STATE
2035-152373-0005 IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SUN GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNUAL OBLATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEARTS STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BELL MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE ECLIPSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION AND THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND THE OVERTHREW OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLAIN OF PROSTRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE
2035-152373-0006 LASTLY THE ROYAL BROTHERS FELL THEMSELVES VICTIMS TO THE EPIDEMIC WHICH SO SADLY SIGNALISES THE REIGN
2035-152373-0007 THE ONLY CONFLICTS THAT OCCURRED ON IRISH SOIL WITH A PICTISH OR AN ANGLO SAXON FORCE IF WE EXCEPT THOSE WHO FORMED A CONTINGENT OF CONGALL'S ARMY AT MOIRA OCCURRED IN THE TIME OF THE HOSPITABLE FENACTA

2035-152373-0009 THE SAXONS OF KENT AND THE SOUTHERN KINGDOMS GENERALLY WERE CONVERTED BY MISSIONARIES FROM FRANCE OR ROME OR NATIVE PREACHERS OF THE FIRST OR SECOND CHRISTIAN GENERATION THOSE OF NORTHUMBRIA RECOGNIZED AS THEIR APOSTLES SAINT ADEN AND SAINT CUTHBERT TWO FATHERS FROM IONA
2035-152373-0010 A KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA AS THE NAME IMPLIES EMBRACED NEARLY ALL THE COUNTRY FROM THE HUMBER TO THE PICTISH BORDER
2035-152373-0011 THE BARREN ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF PRINCES AND KINGS
2035-152373-0012 NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FROM IONA HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY WAS EQUALLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL
2035-152373-0013 WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEATH THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONA WAS PITCHED ON THE WRATH OF TARA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAS FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE
2035-152373-0014 SO SLOW AND EASY IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITY INFUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A CONVERTED PEOPLE

2078-142845-0005 NEXT TAKE EITHER A LARGE TABLESPOONFUL OF BREWERS YEAST WHICH HAS BEEN RENDERED SOLID BY MIXING IT WITH PLENTY OF COLD WATER AND LETTING IT AFTERWARDS STAND TO SETTLE FOR A DAY AND NIGHT OR AN OUNCE OF GERMAN YEAST PUT IT INTO A LARGE BASIN AND PROCEED TO MIX IT SO THAT IT SHALL BE AS SMOOTH AS CREAM WITH A THREE QUARTERS PINT OF WARM MILK AND WATER OR WITH WATER ONLY THOUGH EVEN A VERY LITTLE MILK WILL MUCH IMPROVE THE BREAD
2078-142845-0006 LOOK AT IT FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN IT HAS BEEN LAID FOR NEARLY AN HOUR AND WHEN THE YEAST HAS RISEN AND BREAKING THROUGH THE FLOUR SO THAT BUBBLES APPEAR IN IT YOU WILL KNOW THAT IT IS READY TO BE MADE UP INTO DOUGH
2078-142845-0007 THEN PLACE THE PAN ON A SHORT CHAIR OR DRESSER OR TABLE OF CONVENIENT HEIGHT POUR INTO THE SPONGE THE REMAINDER OF THE WARM MILK AND WATER STIR INTO IT AS MUCH OF THE FLOUR AS YOU CAN WITH THE SPOON THEN WIPE IT OUT CLEAN WITH YOUR FINGERS AND LAY IT ASIDE

2078-142845-0011 IT WILL GROW ON POOR SOILS AND IS ESPECIALLY PRODUCTIVE
2078-142845-0012 IT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO ITALY WHERE THEY MAKE A COARSE BREAD FROM IT AND IT IS ALSO EMPLOYED IN PASTRY AND PUDDINGS THEY ALSO USE IT FOR FEEDING HORSES AND DOMESTICS

2078-142845-0026 BUT TO MAKE DRY TOAST
2078-142845-0027 NEVER USE NEW BREAD FOR MAKING SOME KIND OF TOAST AS IT EATS HEAVY AND BESIDES IT IS VERY EXTRAVAGANT
2078-142845-0028 MOVE IT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS UNTIL THE BREAD IS NICELY COLOURED THEN TURN IT AND TOAST THE OTHER SIDE AND DO NOT PLACE IT SO NEAR THE FIRES THAT IT BLACKENS

2078-142845-0030 A LOAF OF HOUSEHOLD BREAD ABOUT TWO DAYS OLD ANSWERS FOR MAKING TOAST BETTER THAN COTTAGE BREAD THE LATTER NOT BEING A GOOD SHAPE AND TOO CUSTY FOR THE PURPOSE
2078-142845-0031 CUT AS MANY NICE EVEN SLICES AS MAY BE REQUIRED RATHER MORE THAN ONE QUARTERS INCH IN THICKNESS AND TOAST THEM BEFORE A VERY BRIGHT FIRE WITHOUT ALLOWING THE BREAD TO BLACKEN WHICH SPOILS THE APPEARANCE AND FLAVOUR OF ALL TOAST
2078-142845-0032 SAWYER RECOMMENDS THAT EACH SLICE SHOULD BE CUT INTO PIECES AS SOON AS IT WAS BUTTERED AND WHEN ALL ARE READY THAT THEY SHOULD BE PILED LIGHTLY ON THE DISH THEY ARE INTENDED TO BE SERVED ON
2078-142845-0033 HE SAYS THAT BY CUTTING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE SLICES AT A TIME ALL THE BUTTER IS SQUEEZED OUT OF THE APPLE ONES WHILE THE BOTTOM ONE IS SWIMMING IN FAT LIQUID
2078-142845-0034 M MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS SHOULD ALWAYS BE SERVED ON SEPARATE DISHES AND BOTH TOASTED AND SERVED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE

2086-149214-0000 THE NARRATIVE IT MAY BE IS WOVEN OF SO HORRIBLE A TEXTURE AS TO REQUIRE THIS ADVANTAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO RENDER IT THE MORE DIFFICULT OF ATTAINMENT
2086-149214-0001 IN MY FAITH HOWEVER HE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMAGINATIVE TO FLATTER HIMSELF WITH THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF THIS KIND
2086-149214-0002 THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED IT HARDLY WORTH HIS WHILE THEREFORE RELENTLESSLY TO IMPALE THE STORY WITH THE MORAL AS WITH AN IRON ROD OR RATHER AS BY STICKING A PEN THROUGH A BUTTERFLY THUS AT ONCE DEPRIVING IT OF LIFE AND CAUSING IT TO STIFFEN IN AN UNGAINLY AND UNNATURAL ATTITUDE
2086-149214-0003 IF PERMITTED BY THE HISTORICAL CONNEXION WHICH THOUGH SLIGHT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS PLAN THE AUTHOR WOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE AVOIDED OF THIS NATURE
2086-149214-0004 HE TRUSTS NOTHING TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNPARDONABLY OFFENDING BY LAYING OUT A STREET THAT INFRINGES UPON NOBODY'S PRIVATE RIGHTS AND APPROPRIATING A LOT OF LAND WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE OWNER AND BUILDING A HOUSE OF MATERIALS LONG IN USE FOR CONSTRUCTING CASTLES IN THE AIR
2086-149220-0000 THE INCLOSURE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE BUT WAS NOW CONTRACTED WITHIN SMALL COMPASS AND HEMMED ABOUT PARTLY BY HIGH WOODEN FENCES AND PARTLY BY THE OUTBUILDINGS OF HOUSES THAT STOOD IN ANOTHER STREET
2086-149220-0001 THE WHITE DOUBLE ROSE BUSH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PROPPED UP ANEW AGAINST THE HOUSES SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SEASON AND THE PEAR TREE AND THREE DAMSON TREES WHICH EXCEPT A ROW OF CURRANT BUSHES CONSTITUTED THE ONLY VARIETIES OF FRUIT BORE MARKS OF THE RECENT AMPUTATION OF SEVERAL SUPERFLUOUS OR DEFECTIVE LIMBS
2086-149220-0002 THERE WERE ALSO A FEW SPECIES OF ANTIQUE AND HEREDITARY FLOWERS IN NO VERY FLOURISHING CONDITION BUT SCRUPULOUSLY WEEDED AS IF A PERSON EITHER OUT OF LOVE OR CURIOSITY HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO BRING THEM TO SUCH PERFECTION AS THEY WERE CAPABLE OF ATTAINING
2086-149220-0003 SUMMER SQUASHES ALMOST IN THEIR GOLDEN BLOSSOM CUCUMBERS NOW EVINCING A TENDENCY TO SPREAD AWAY FROM THE MAIN STALK AND RAMBLE FAR AND WIDE TWO OR THREE ROWS OF STRING BEANS AND AS MANY MORE THAT ARE ABOUT TO FESTOON THEMSELVES ON POLES TOMATOES OCCUPYING A SITE SO SHELTERED AND SUNNY THAT THE PLANTS WERE ALREADY GIGANTIC AND PROMISED AN EARLY AND ABUNDANT HARVEST
2086-149220-0004 PHOEBE WONDERED WHOSE CARE AND TOIL IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT HAD PLANTED THEIR VEGETABLES AND KEPT THE SOIL SO CLEAN AND ORDERLY
2086-149220-0005 BEES TOO STRANGE TO SAY HAD THOUGHT IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO COME HERE POSSIBLY FROM THE RANGE OF HIVES BESIDE SOME FARM HOUSE MILES AWAY
2086-149220-0006 THIS WAS A FOUNTAIN SET ROUND WITH A TRIM OF OLD MOSSY STONES AND PAVED IN ITS BED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SORT OF MOSAIC WORK OF VARIOUSLY COLORED PEBBLES
2086-149220-0007 IT NOW CONTAINED ONLY CHANTICLEER HIS TWO WIVES AND A SOLITARY CHICKENS
2086-149220-0008 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE RACE HAD DEGENERATED LIKE MANY A NORMAL RACE BESIDES IN CONSEQUENCE OF TOO STRICT A WATCHFULNESS TO KEEP IT PURE
2086-149220-0009 THESE FEATHERED PEOPLE HAD EXISTED TOO LONG IN THEIR GREAT VARIETY A FACT OF WHICH THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVES JUDGING BY THEIR LUGUBRIOUS DEPORTMENT SEEMED TO BE AWARE
2086-149220-0010 THEY KEPT THEMSELVES ALIVE UNQUESTIONABLY AND LAID NOW AND THEN AN EGG AND HATCHED A CHICKEN NOT FOR ANY PLEASURE OF THEIR OWN BUT THAT THE WORLD MIGHT NOT ABSOLUTELY LOSE WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SO ADMIRABLE THE BREED OF FOWLS
2086-149220-0011 THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF THE HEN'S WAS A CREST OF LAMENTABLY SCANTY GROWTH IN THESE LATTER DAYS BUT SO ODDLY AND WICKEDLY ANALOGOUS TO HEPSBA'S TURBAN THAT PHOEBE TO THE POIGNANT DISTRESS OF HER CONSCIENCE BUT INEVITABLY WAS LED TO FANCY A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE BETWIXT THESE FORLORN BIPEDS AND HER RESPECTABLE RELATIVE
2086-149220-0012 THE CHICKEN CREPT THROUGH THE PAILS OF THE COOP AND CAME WITH SOME SHOW OF LIVELINESS TO HER FEET WHILE CHANTICLEER AND THE LADIES OF HIS HOUSEHOLD REGARDED HER WITH QUEER SIDELONG GLANCES AND THEN CROAKED ONE TO ANOTHER AS IF COMMUNICATING THEIR SAGE OPINIONS OF HER CHARACTER
2086-149220-0013 SO WISE AS WELL AS ANTIQUE WAS THEIR ASPECT AS TO GIVE COLOUR TO THE IDEA NOT MERELY THAT THEY WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF A TIME HONORED RACE BUT THAT THEY HAD EXISTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY EVER SINCE A HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES WAS FOUNDED AND WERE SOMEHOW MIXED UP WITH ITS DESTINY
2086-149220-0014 HE HELD A HOE IN HIS HAND AND WHILE PHOEBE WAS GONE IN QUEST OF THE CRUMBS HAD BEGUN TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH DRAWING UP FRESH EARTH ABOVE THE ROOTS OF THE TOMATOES

2086-149220-0023 MOST OF MY LIKENESSES DO LOOK UNAMIABLE BUT THE VERY CERTAIN REASON I FANCY IS BECAUSE THE ORIGINALS ARE SO

2086-149220-0025 WHILE WE GIVE IT CREDIT ONLY FOR DEPICTING THE MEREST SURFACE IT ALSO BRINGS OUT THE SECRET CHARACTER WITH A TRUTH THAT NO PAINTER WOULD EVER VENTURE UPON EVEN COULD HE DETECT IT
2086-149220-0026 HERE THE ORIGINAL WEARS TO COMMON EYES A VERY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION
2086-149220-0027 HE EXHIBITED A GAGAROTYPED MINIATURE IN A MOROCCO CASE
2086-149220-0028 PHOEBE MERELY GLANCED AT ME AND GAVE IT BACK
2086-149220-0029 I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS A ROMAN FACE AND ONE WHICH YOU WILL VERY PROBABLY MEET
2086-149220-0030 THAT SUN AS YOU SEE TELLS QUITE ANOTHER STORY AND WE'LL NOT BE COAXED OUT OF IT AFTER HALF A DOZEN PATIENT ATTEMPTS ON MY PART

2086-149220-0034 IF THE ORIGINAL IS STILL IN THE WORLD I THINK HE MIGHT DEFY THE FATHER TO MAKE HIM LOOK STERN AND HARD
2086-149220-0035 IS THERE NOTHING WILD IN THE EYE CONTINUED HOLGRAVE SO EARNESTLY THAT IT EMBARRASSED PHOEBE AS DID ALSO THE QUIET FREEDOM WITH WHICH HE PRESUMED ON HIS SO RECENT ACQUAINTANCE
2086-149220-0036 IT IS NONSENSE SAID PHOEBE A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY FOR ME TO TALK ABOUT A PICTURE WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
2086-149220-0037 SINCE YOU ARE A FRIEND OF MY COUSIN HEPSEBA'S YOU SHOULD ASK HER TO SHOW YOU THE PICTURE

2086-149220-0046 PRAY GO TO BED FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST KNOW REST
2086-149220-0047 I WILL SIT IN THAT PARLOUR A WHILE AND COLLECT MY THOUGHTS
2086-149220-0048 WHILE THUS DISMAYING HER THE MAIDEN LADY STEPPED FORWARD KISSED PHOEBE AND PRESSED HER TO HER HEART WHICH BEAT AGAINST THE GIRL'S BOSOM WITH A STRONG HIGH AND TUMULTUOUS SWELL
2086-149220-0049 AT SOME UNSEEN PERIOD IN THE DEPTHS OF NIGHT AND AS IT WERE THROUGH THE THIN VEIL OF A DREAM SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FOOTSTEP MOUNTING THE STAIRS HEAVILY BUT NOT WITH FORCE AND DECISION
2277-149874-0000 MINNIE'S FLAT AS THE ONE FLOOR RESIDENT APARTMENTS WERE THEN BEING CALLED WAS IN A PART OF WEST VAN BUREN STREET INHABITED BY FAMILIES OF LABOURERS AND CLERKS MEN WHO HAD COME AND WERE STILL COMING WITH THE RUSH OF POPULATION POURING IN AT THE RATE OF THIRTY THOUSAND A YEAR
2277-149874-0001 TO CARRIE THE SOUND OF THE LITTLE BELLS UPON THE HORSE GUARDS AS THEY TINKLED IN AND OUT OF HEARING WAS AS PLEASING AS IT WAS NOVEL
2277-149874-0002 TO HIM THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF HIS WIFE'S SISTER WAS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
2277-149874-0003 HE WAS OF A CLEAN SAVING DISPOSITION AND HAD ALWAYS PAID A NUMBER OF MONTHLY INSTALMENTS ON TWO LOTS FAR OUT ON THE WEST SIDE
2277-149874-0004 MY AMBITION WAS SOME DAY TO BUILD A HOUSE ON THEM
2277-149874-0005 SHE HAD SOME SLIGHT GIFT OF OBSERVATION BUT THAT SENSE SO RICH IN EVERY WOMAN INTUITION
2277-149874-0006 THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS WERE DISCORDANTLY BATTERED
2277-149874-0007 THE FLOORS WERE COVERED WITH MATTING AND THE HALL LAID WITH A THIN GRAY CARPET
2277-149874-0008 THEN SHE WALKED AND SANG TO IT UNTIL HANSEN DISTURBED IN HIS DREAM CAME AND TOOK IT
2277-149874-0009 THE ONE COULD SEE THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN HIS OFFSPRING
2277-149874-0010 NOW KNOW HE SAID WALKING THERE THERE AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN SWEDISH ACCENT NOTICEABLE IN HIS VOICE
2277-149874-0011 HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING FOR SOMETHING ELSE
2277-149874-0012 MINNIE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN BUT HER HUSBAND TOOK THIS PART OF A CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF
2277-149874-0013 YOU COULD GET OFF EASY TOO IT ISN'T VERY FAR
2277-149874-0014 HE ASKED MINNIE FOR INK AND PAPER WHICH WERE UPON THE MANTEL IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD GONE TO BED AT TEN GOT OUT DROUET'S CARD AND WROTE HIM
2277-149874-0015 SHE WANTED TO MAKE SOME REFERENCE TO THEIR RELATIONS UPON THE TRAIN AND WAS TOO TIMID
2277-149874-0016 ANYTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH SO LONG AS IT PAID FOR FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK TO BEGIN WITH
2277-149874-0017 A SHOP BOY WAS THE DESTINY PREFIGURED FOR THE NEW COMER
2277-149874-0018 IT IS UNDER SUCH AUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE STARTED OUT THIS MORNING TO LOOK FOR WORK
2277-149874-0019 NARROW BOARD WALKS EXTENDED OUT PASSING HERE A HOUSE AND HERE A STORE AT FAR INTERVALS EVENTUALLY ENDING ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE
2277-149874-0020 IT GAVE AN IMPOSING APPEARANCE TO MOST OF THE WHOLESALE HOUSES WHOSE OFFICES WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR AND IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE STREAM
2277-149874-0021 FOR THESE VAST BUILDINGS WHAT WERE THEY
2277-149896-0000 HE WAS IN A FEVERED STATE OF THE MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFE'S ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE
2277-149896-0001 HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY HER THE MONEY WHICH SHE MIGHT NOW REGULARLY DEMAND OR THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HE DID
2277-149896-0002 HURSTWOOD WALKED THE FLOOR MENTALLY ARRANGING THE BEST POINTS OF HIS SITUATION
2277-149896-0003 HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAGERIAL VISIT
2277-149896-0004 HOW WOULD THE PAPERS STOP ABOUT IT
2277-149896-0005 MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BROW MOISTENED IT
2277-149896-0006 HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR KARY WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY
2277-149896-0007 HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK OF HER THEY WERE GOING TO MEET AS USUAL
2277-149896-0008 FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY HE WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANNED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED
2277-149896-0009 WHILE THE DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALIZED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS
2277-149896-0010 SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DRUE THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT
2277-149896-0011 HE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RUMINATED AND FINALLY DECIDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING
2277-149896-0012 THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY THIS MORNING
2277-149896-0013 HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR AT ONCE
2277-149896-0014 AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAITING AND DREARILY HEADED FOR THE MAISON CAR
2277-149896-0015 HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CARRY
2277-149896-0016 FORTUNATELY THERE WAS LITTLE FROM HIS WIFE EITHER
2277-149896-0017 AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO RECTOR'S FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER IS WAITING FOR HIM
2277-149896-0018 HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOUR WORDS IN REPLY GO TO THE FELLOW
2277-149896-0019 BUT HE COMPROMISED BY TELLING THE WOMAN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY
2277-149896-0020 THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING A RESULT OF HIS WORK
2277-149896-0021 WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THE CONFOUNDED MATCH
2277-149896-0022 LATER HOWEVER HIS ILL DISCRETION ASSERTED ITSELF
2277-149896-0023 SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CLIMAX WERE NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SIT IDLE
2277-149896-0024 HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDED UPON THIS PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP
2277-149896-0025 HE AROSE FROM HIS CHAMBER AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET
2277-149896-0026 THE LONG DRIZZLE HAD BEGUN PEDESTRIAN HAD TURNED UP COLLARS AND TROUSERS AT THE BOTTOM
2277-149896-0027 HURSTWOOD ALMOST EXCLAIMED OUT LOUD AT THIS INSISTENCY OF THIS THING
2277-149896-0028 HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED ALONG FOR HIS UMBRELLA
2277-149896-0029 HE WOULD HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF THIS DAY
2277-149896-0030 HE BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THAT HE HAD SENT THAT MONEY PERHAPS HE COULD DO IT UP HERE
2277-149896-0031 HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANYHOW HE WILL HAVE NO ROW
2277-149896-0032 BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER AND OVER THAT SOME SOLUTION SHOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT
2277-149896-0033 THEN HE RING THE BELL NO ANSWER
2277-149896-0034 HE RANG AGAIN AND THIS TIME HARDER STILL NO ANSWER
2277-149897-0000 WHEN XHURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER
2277-149897-0001 YOU COULD HARDLY REALIZE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT
2277-149897-0002 NO LETTER HAS COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING
2277-149897-0003 HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD BEEN FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE
2277-149897-0004 HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PANACEA FOR THE ILL WHICH THREATENED HIM
2277-149897-0005 IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL EXPERIMENTATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN ENVELOPE PLACED IN IT THE REQUESTED AMOUNT AND SLOWLY SEALED IT UP
2277-149897-0006 THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND A PLACE
2277-149897-0007 YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING ME THE ENVELOPE AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY
2277-149897-0008 ANY ANSWER I SHALL NOT
2277-149897-0009 THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MOUSINGS
2277-149897-0010 HE WAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL TAKE THE BEST OF IT
2277-149897-0011 SHE WOULD TAKE THE ENVELOPE AND KNOW WHAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED
2277-149897-0012 IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T FIND IT
2277-149897-0013 FOR RELIEF SHE AROSE AND JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING
2277-149897-0014 ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUSH OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THEREIN ENACTED
2277-149897-0015 IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE LADY RETURNED
2277-149897-0016 HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MERELY HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK
2277-149897-0017 HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR FIGHT HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE SUBJECT
2277-149897-0018 HE DECIDED TO RIGHT HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
2277-149897-0019 THREE O'CLOCK CAME ONE FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER
2277-149897-0020 THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE SCENE OF DEFEAT
2277-149897-0021 HE SAW A BUSY SATURDAY DAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH IN AND NOTHING DONE
2277-149897-0022 ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE BROODED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RESORT FROM KERRIES AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE IOTA
2277-149897-0023 IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT HIS LIFE
2277-149897-0024 IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TRAVELS WERE JUST BEGINNING
2277-149897-0025 HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED IN HIS PERFIDY
2277-149897-0026 HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THIS POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE
2277-149897-0027 HE WOULD GO TO HERS AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMPLICATIONS
2277-149897-0028 HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE DID AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER
2277-149897-0029 HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO KERY BUT WHEN HE GOT IN OGDEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY
2277-149897-0030 HE DID NOT MOVE WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE
2277-149897-0031 HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY TO WOMEN
2277-149897-0032 HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCHMAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF HE WAS SAFELY LOCKED
2277-149897-0033 ON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMES AND MAY IT READ
2277-149897-0034 DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD TO DIVORCE AND ALIMONY
2277-149897-0035 VERY TRULY YOURS ET CETERA COMPROMISELY
2277-149897-0036 SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND YET HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
2277-149897-0037 IF HE DIDN'T GO AND SEE THEM THEN THEY WOULD SUE HIM PROMPTLY
2412-153947-0000 PREFACE INTO THE SECOND EDITION
2412-153947-0001 THIS IS A MISTAKE FOR A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE
2412-153947-0002 ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISION TO THE PRINTER
2412-153947-0003 THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT I WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER
2412-153947-0004 I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS THE ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY
2412-153947-0005 I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE
2412-153947-0006 BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFELONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THE FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
2412-153947-0007 I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICKS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES
2412-153947-0008 IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RANGUTADA DISTRICT OF THE CANTERBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRISTCHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
2412-153947-0009 I ALSO WROTE AROUND THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION
2412-153947-0010 I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TREUBENNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
2412-153947-0011 I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVORABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST ON THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH
2412-153947-0012 THERE WAS ALL ANOTHER CAUSE
2412-153947-0013 THE FIRST EDITION OF EREWHON SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MOLDS AND AS THE DEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN
2412-153947-0014 I MAKE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOLDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STEREOS THEN MADE
2412-153947-0015 I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF IREWHONE THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD
2412-153947-0016 THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPYRIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER THIRTY YEARS
2412-153948-0000 IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO HERSELF
2412-153948-0001 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT I WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE
2412-153948-0002 NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HONEST COULD DOUBT MY BEING SO
2412-153948-0003 I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD DISCOVER IN WHICH HEMISPHERE I WAS
2412-153948-0004 SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BRED WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF COUNTRY GOING INLAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN ACRE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RANGES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPOTTED OVER AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY
2412-153948-0005 I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE METHOD OF LIFE
2412-153948-0006 I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHTY HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING EWES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET
2412-153948-0007 THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEW OF TWO OR THREE BLACK EWES AND A BLACK LAMB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DISTINGUISHING MARK WHEREBY I COULD TELL THEM
2412-153948-0008 IT IS SURPRISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE DOZEN
2412-153948-0009 IT WAS THE MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL
2412-153948-0010 MY COUNTRY WAS THE GRANDEST THAT CAN BE IMAGINED
2412-153948-0011 SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GREY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAMB BLEATING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH THE LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING
2412-153948-0012 EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH HIM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHTFALL
2412-153948-0013 I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BORROWED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE ONE
2412-153948-0014 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO PASS IT
2412-153948-0015 I WOULD TRY THE FARTHER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO
2412-153954-0000 SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THIS MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE
2412-153954-0001 MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOR ON THEM
2412-153954-0002 THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY PLEASANT
2412-153954-0003 THE VINE GREW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGNED BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME
2412-153954-0004 EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF THE SHOPLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGETATED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN HEIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEAKEST
2412-153954-0005 EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECTED
2412-153954-0006 THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION IN FEELINGS WHICH WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY
2412-153954-0007 EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMELY AND THE OLD GRAY HAIRED PEOPLE AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN
2412-153954-0008 THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN BUT BEAUTIFUL
2412-153954-0009 I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGYPTIANS GREEK AND ITALIAN
2412-153954-0010 THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN WITH THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY
2412-153954-0011 I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THESE WERE GREATLY PLEASED
2412-153954-0012 THE COUNTRY WAS THICKLY CULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING
2412-153954-0013 I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS NECKS
2412-153954-0014 ON ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER
2412-153954-0015 SUFFICE IT THAT I HAD FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME
2412-153954-0016 IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND COUGHED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SPITE OF MY MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT
2412-153954-0017 THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELLOUSLY SELF CONTAINED BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
2412-153954-0018 THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TONGUE THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FOUND ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
2412-153954-0019 BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHILE THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH
2412-153954-0020 AGAIN THEN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR IRON RAILS
2412-153954-0021 WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE SMALL WATCHES
2412-153954-0022 THE DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THINGS WAS CLEARLY THE SAME
2412-153954-0023 WHICH HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HIM
2412-153954-0024 HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO RELENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN KINDER MANNER
2428-83699-0000 I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP IN MY CHAMBERS OR HORRORS OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FESTIVE SEASON
2428-83699-0001 FESTIVE NO
2428-83699-0002 THE REPLY WAS WRITTEN IN A SPRAWLING FEMININE HAND THIS WAS A LITTLE VAGUE
2428-83699-0003 IT APPEARED THAT THE TERMS MIGHT BE FIVE GUINEAS BUT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT FEE WOULD COVER
2428-83699-0004 THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE EXCITING
2428-83699-0005 THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMMODATION WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED BUT NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT
2428-83699-0006 NOW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A EXTRAORDINARY PREDILECTION FOR THE NAME MADGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY
2428-83699-0007 I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MADGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARDS I HAD DESIRED TO MEET ONE
2428-83699-0008 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE LIVELY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MADGE AND IT WAS THE ACCIDENT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHICH DECIDED TO GO
2428-83699-0009 I HAD NO ALLUSION
2428-83699-0010 I DID NOT ASK A PRINCELY ENTERTAINMENT
2428-83699-0011 ALL NIGHT IT HAD BEEN GLOWING AND RAINING
2428-83699-0012 I FELT QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MINGLED WITH THE CHRISTMAS CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURNED OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS
2428-83699-0013 I EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MADGE I I MEAN MISSUS WILSON
2428-83699-0014 IT WAS A HORRIBLE TRAIN
2428-83699-0015 HE WAS IMPERVIOUS IN REASON
2428-83699-0016 IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE OFFICIALS HOWEVER COOL I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF
2428-83699-0017 WHEN AT LAST I REACHED CROFTON MY JOURNEY'S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE STATION STAFF CONSISTED OF A HALF WITTED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STATION MASTER PORTER AND CLERK COMBINED AND A HULKING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THEY WAS TO DO
2428-83699-0018 NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND HANGER DEANE THE HOUSE TO WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOUGHED FIELDS MY INFORMANT DID NOT MENTION
2428-83699-0019 THERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BUOYNE BLUNDERBUSS BUT THAT REQUIRED FETCHING
2428-83699-0020 WHEN THE TRAP DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UNCOMMONLY LIKE AN OPEN SPRING CUT
2428-83699-0021 IN IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH A LUGGAGE
2428-83699-0022 I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANS
2428-83699-0023 I DID NOT ASK IT WAS BEYOND IT
2428-83699-0024 I WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HEAVY
2428-83699-0025 I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT OUR OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTURING IN QUEST OF ONE
2428-83699-0026 HERE WE BE AND MIGHT BE SO
2428-83699-0027 THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YO GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND EM
2428-83699-0028 THERE'S A KNOCKER THOUGH NONE OF EM HAVEN'T TWISTED IT OFF
2428-83699-0029 THERE APPEARED TO BE NO KNOCKER THOUGH WHETHER THEY HAD BEEN TWISTED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SAY
2428-83699-0030 NO ANSWER IF I ALLOWED A MORE THAN DECENT INTERVAL
2428-83699-0031 BUT BETTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD
2428-83699-0032 MAYBE THEY'RE UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS ROUTING
2428-83699-0033 THE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT APPEARED LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE
2428-83699-0034 PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ON THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PEARS IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
2428-83699-0035 A VOICE CONTINUED WHO'S THERE
2428-83699-0036 HIS INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMMONLY LIKE A CHORUS OF LAUGHTER
2428-83699-0037 IT WAS A RUSH OF RETREATING FEET AN EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
2428-83699-0038 WHO LIVES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE NOW
2428-83699-0039 I TOLLED HIS BELL AGAIN
2428-83699-0040 AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASTENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THEY STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND
2428-83699-0041 I'M MISTER CHRISTOPHER ON LONDON
2428-83699-0042 WE'VE LOST THE KEY OF THE CELLAR AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE THAT
2428-83705-0000 HER HUSBAND IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST
2428-83705-0001 BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIS WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLINGS
2428-83705-0002 I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL OF MARIANNE'S THINGS HAVE BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED
2428-83705-0003 IT IS JUST DELIGHTFUL
2428-83705-0004 IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE'S WEDDING SO UNIMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SET TO PLAY AT IT
2428-83705-0005 FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOR IN THE MATTER OF THIS RING
2428-83705-0006 THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED UPON MY SUNDAY EVENING
2428-83705-0007 THE GIRL IS FRETTING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE HER
2428-83705-0008 I GASPED POSITIVELY GASPER
2428-83705-0009 THAT'S THERE ON YOUR ACCOUNT
2428-83705-0010 FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHO'S IN HIS LINE
2428-83705-0011 I NEVER SAW A PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES AT ALL SORTS OF LINES
2428-83705-0012 I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARIANNE'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED HER THE AMOUNT
2428-83705-0013 IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY AMBITION SPRINGS
2428-83705-0014 THERE SHE OWNS A COTTAGE BUT IT MAY BE A PIG STY FOR ALL I KNOW
2428-83705-0015 WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARIANNE SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONEYMOON IN HER COTTAGE OR A PIG STY AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
2428-83705-0016 THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF A LANGUAGE
2428-83705-0017 I FOUND THAT AS A MATTER OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS
2428-83705-0018 IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FRANCS A YEAR
2428-83705-0019 AND OF COURSE I HAS MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS
2428-83705-0020 IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT IT
2428-83705-0021 I SHALL HAVE PAPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST
2428-83705-0022 A BIRD IN MY HAND IS WORTH TWO IN A BUSH AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US
2428-83705-0023 I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SAY SHE GIVES IT
2428-83705-0024 AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SHIRKING AROUND THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER
2428-83705-0025 I HAVE DRAWN OUT A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DON'T GET IT
2428-83705-0026 OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAINLY AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING
2428-83705-0027 THE HERS HAS BEEN PRODIGIOUS
2428-83705-0028 SHE HAS A KNACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHED AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS
2428-83705-0029 I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED YOUR OFFERINGS
2428-83705-0030 THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARY ANNE A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMED TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RANCOROUS ACIDITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE
2428-83705-0031 SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATURE AND
2428-83705-0032 BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALTOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTOOD
2428-83705-0033 WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARY ANNE PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WHITING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING NEW
2428-83705-0034 THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MC PHERSON SAID TO ME ALL THE OTHER DAY
2428-83705-0035 AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MC PHERSON HAS MARIANNE GIVEN YOU HER
2428-83705-0036 AND SOME ONE SNIGGERED
2428-83705-0037 I CANNOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SNELLINGS GROW
2428-83705-0038 AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RENDY WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
2428-83705-0039 P S THE CARDS ARE NOT FOR THE WEDDING
2428-83705-0040 WE'VE GOING FOR OUR HONEYMOON TO ITALY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
2428-83705-0041 A SECOND COUSIN OF BARONNE'S IS IN THE COOK'S TOURS LINE
2428-83705-0042 HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR JOURNEYS AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COUPONS FOR FREE BOARD AND LODGING AT THE HOTEL IT'S A WEDDING PRESENT
2428-83705-0043 BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE COUPONS AND RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE WON'T USE
251-118436-0000 HE WAS YOUNG AND NO SPEAR HAD TOUCHED HIM NO POISON LURKED IN HIS WINE
251-118436-0001 I CAN TELL YOU IT IS NOT POISON SHE CRIED
251-118436-0002 SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVEREST COINERS OF THE EAST COULD NOT REACH HIM
251-118436-0003 AS YOU WELL KNOW THERE WERE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOLE DUTY IS TO TASTE HIS FOOD AND WINE AND FIFTY ARMED WARRIORS GUARD HIS CHAMBER AS THEY GUARD IT NOW
251-118436-0004 A LOW CONFUSED MOAN WANNED FROM HIS MOUTH
251-118436-0005 THE MAN SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDER AND TURNED BACK INTO THE ARABESQUE CHAMBER
251-118436-0006 THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CAMELS HAIR ROBE AND SANDALS AND A GREEN TURBAN WAS ON HIS HEAD
251-118436-0007 NOT UNTIL THE HEAVENS WERE IN THE OPEN ORDER COULD THEY PERFORM THIS NECROMANCY
251-118436-0008 WITH A LONG STAINING FINGER NAIL HE MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS ON THE MARBLE TILED FLOOR
251-118436-0009 THE SLANT OF THE MOON PRESAGED EVIL FOR THE KING OF VENDYA THE STARS ARE IN TURMOIL THE SERPENT IN THE BODY OF THE ELEPHANT
251-118436-0010 POINT OF CONTACT INQUIRED THE GIRL
251-118436-0011 ALL DISCARDED PORTIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY STILL REMAIN PART OF IT HAD ATTACHED TO IT BY INTANGIBLE CONNECTIONS
251-118436-0012 BUT AT THE URGENT ENTREATY OF THE PRINCESS OF KOSALA WHO LOVED BUNDAH CHAN VAINLY HE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE
251-118436-0013 BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAWN FROM ITS BODY AND ACROSS GULFS OF ECHOING SPACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE MOUNT
251-118436-0014 BUT ON THE DAIS UNDER THE GOLDEN DOME THE KING CRIED OUT AGAIN RACKED BY AWFUL PAROXYSMS
251-118436-0015 THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER CORD THAT BINDS ME TO MY DYING BROTHER
251-118436-0016 THEY CLUSTER AROUND ME THEIR HANDS ARE TALONED THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE FLAME BURNING IN THAT DARKNESS
251-118436-0017 THEIR FINGERS SEARE ME LIKE FIRE
251-118436-0018 I KNOW NOW WHAT BRINGS ME TO THE PYREN
251-118436-0019 THERE THEY STROVE TO BREAK THE SILVER CORDS OF LIFE AND THRUST MY SOUL INTO THE BODY OF A FOUL KNIGHT WEIRD THEIR SORCERY SUMMONED UP FROM HELL AH
251-118436-0020 YOUR CRY AND THE GRIP OF YOUR FINGERS BROUGHT ME BACK BUT I AM DOING FAST
251-118436-0021 THERE WAS THE OLD IMPERIOUS NOTE IN HIS FAILING LAUGHTER
251-118436-0022 YOU HAVE NEVER DISOBEYED ME AND OBEY MY LAST COMMAND
251-118436-0023 SEND MY SOUL CLEAN TO ISSURA
251-136532-0000 THEY ALSO FOUND A MARTIAN CALENDAR THE YEAR HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO TEN MORE OR LESS EQUAL MONTHS AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DOOM
251-136532-0001 BILL CHANLER THE ZOOLOGIST HAD BEEN GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD SEA BOTTOM OF CYTHERUS
251-136532-0002 THAT TOOK THE CENTRE OF INTEREST AWAY FROM ARCHAEOLOGY AND STARTED A NEW BURSTS OF ACTIVITY
251-136532-0003 THE CIVILIAN SPECIALISTS IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TAPE LINES AND MAKING SKETCHES AND SNAPPING CAMERAS WERE ALL FLYING TO A LOWER CYRTUS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OXYGEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT SUPPORTED
251-136532-0004 THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOOSELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLASSED AS A REPTILE AND A CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIRD LIKE CLAWS AND A HERBIVORE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE PIGLIKE THING IN THE BIG DORLF HOLVA MURAL AND ANOTHER LIKE A GAZELLE WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD
251-136532-0005 THE DAILY NEWSCASTS FROM TERRA SHOWED A CORRESPONDING SHIFT AND INTEREST AT HOME
251-136532-0006 TONY'S FOUNDS THE MARTIANS
251-136532-0007 IT WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE AND WE HAD TO BURN IT DOWN WITH A TORCH THAT'S WHERE THERE ARE
251-136532-0008 GLORIA STANDISH WHO HAD DROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE MEZZANINE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADIOPHONE EXTENSION DOZEN AND A HALF OF STEAM
251-136532-0009 WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE DEAD WHAT A SHOCK
251-136532-0010 MARTHA REMEMBERED THE CLOSED DOOR ON THE FIRST SURVEY THAT HADN'T ATTEMPTED OPENING IT
251-136532-0011 NOW IT WAS BURNED AWAY AT BOTH SIDES AND LAY STILL HOT ALONG THE EDGES ON THE FLOOR OF THE BIG OFFICE HOUSE IN FRONT
251-136532-0012 A FLOOD NIGHT WAS ON IN THE ROOM INSIDE AND LATIMER WAS GOING AROUND LOOKING AT THINGS WHILE A SPACE FORCE OFFICER STOOD BY THE DOOR
251-136532-0013 MASSLY SUICIDE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS NOTICE WHAT'S IN THE CORNERS
251-136532-0014 YES CHARCAL
251-136532-0015 SO THEY JUST CAME IN HERE AND LIT THE CHARCOAL AND SAT DRINKING IT TILL THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP
251-136532-0016 THE TERRAN PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF LIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND THE ROOM FULL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST THING
251-136532-0017 TONY LATIMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATION WITH SYD HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECASTLE OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET
251-136532-0018 WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORYS
251-136532-0019 NOT THAT I'M INTERESTED IN ALL THIS FOR MYSELF HE DISCLAIMED AFTER LISTENING TO THE TELECAST FROM TARA TWO WEEKS AFTER HIS DISCOVERY
251-136532-0020 BRING IT TO THE PUBLICK ATTENTION DRAMATIZE IT
251-136532-0021 NOW I BELIEVE I SHALL GO BACK AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO
251-136532-0022 OH LECTURES
251-136532-0023 THE ORGANIZATION OF A SOCIETY OF MARTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY WITH ANTHONY LATIMER P H D A LOGICAL CANDIDATE FOR THE CHAIR
251-137823-0000 I'LL BE GLAD TO TRY SIR REPLIED
251-137823-0001 INSIDE A SECRET ROCKET TELE METERING DEVICE WAS MOUNTED ON ITS TEST STAND
251-137823-0002 THIS ISN'T PART OF YOUR PROTESTING ROUTINE IS IT
251-137823-0003 ANOTHER ENGINEER RODE TOWARD THE DOOR TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUTSIDE
251-137823-0004 ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT CASCADED FROM THE WALL SHELVES AND A HEAVY DUTY CHAIN HOIST CAME LOOSE FROM ITS OVERHEAD TRAIN PLUNGING TO THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIFYING CRASH
251-137823-0005 AN INSTANT LATER IT CRASHED OVER PINNING THE MARK FABRE BENEATH IT
251-137823-0006 THEN BUD THREW UP HIS ARMS TO PROTECT HIMSELF BUT TOO LATE
251-137823-0007 FOR MOMENTS NO ONE STIRRED AMONG THE WRECKAGE
251-137823-0008 THEN TOM WHO HAD BEEN STUNNING BY SOME FALLING DEBRIS RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSITION
251-137823-0009 TOM'S EYES FOCUSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY THE STILL BILLOWING DUST
251-137823-0010 THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SINGLE GAPING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SAGGING DANGEROUSLY ON ITS SUPPORTING TRUSSES
251-137823-0011 THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD JUST NOTICED HIS FATHER LYING PINNED BENEATH A HEAVY BEAM NEAR BY
251-137823-0012 YOUR FRIEND'S EYELIDS FLICKERED
251-137823-0013 WE'D BETTER NOT TRY TO LOSE HIM TOM DECIDED WE'LL GET AN AMBULANCE
251-137823-0014 THEY PICKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WRECKAGE AND EMERGED ON A SCENE OF DREADFUL DESTRUCTION
251-137823-0015 LET'S SEE ABOUT GETTING HELP FOR MISTER FABURN
251-137823-0016 IT THE ONLY TRUCK WE HAD AVAILABLE WAS IN THAT BURNING SHED THE SUPERINTENDENT ADDED BITTERLY
251-137823-0017 ANYHOW WE WANT TO HELP CUT A JOB FOR US
251-137823-0018 WITHIN MINUTES TOM WAS IN CHARGE OF CLEARING AWAY RUBBLE AND EXTRICATING SOME ONE WHO MIGHT BE TRAPPED INSIDE THE BUILDINGS
251-137823-0019 THE TELEPHONE LINE WAS SOON REPAIRED AND A STEADY STREAM OF RESCUE VEHICLES BEGAN ARRIVING FROM HARKNESS FIRE TRUCKS THREE AMBULANCES AND PRIVATE CARS DRIVEN BY SENATORS
251-137823-0020 THE TWO GIRLS WERE AS MUCH UPSET AS TOM'S MOTHER TOM ASKED
251-137823-0021 MISTER SWIFT CAME INTO THE LIVING ROOM JUST THEN AND TOLD TOM HOW WORRIED MISSUS SWIFT AND SANDY HAD BECOME
251-137823-0022 HE SMILED GUILTILY AS HE ADDED BUT I WILL ADMIT I WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE CONCERNED MYSELF
251-137823-0023 HE'S A RICH SCIENTIST
251-137823-0024 THEN TOM NODDED UNHAPPILY
251-137823-0025 MALE OR FEMALE HUMAN OR ANIMAL HE
251-137823-0026 MISTER SWIFT'S HANDS TWINKLED
2803-154320-0000 FORTUNATELY WILL HALLEY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE EXPRESSIVE CANVAS OR HIS MASTS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN
2803-154320-0001 JOHN MANGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HULL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FOR THE DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG
2803-154320-0002 HIS FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE THEM
2803-154320-0003 THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF THE ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED
2803-154320-0004 MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION ON THE PAMPAS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENCE EARS
2803-154320-0005 HIS EYES WANDERED CEASELESSLY TOWARD THE BLANK HORIZON
2803-154320-0006 IT THEN MY LORD
2803-154320-0007 GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHERE JOHN
2803-154320-0008 WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY THE FLY JOHN
2803-154320-0009 YES MY LORD WE SHOULD SAY IN VAIN
2803-154320-0010 WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT BEFORE THAT
2803-154320-0011 THINK OF LADY GLENARVAN THINK OF MARY GRANT YOU
2803-154320-0012 WILL HALLEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AN IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN
2803-154320-0013 SO THAT AT THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
2803-154320-0014 BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE OF THE DUNCAN GOD FORBID
2803-154328-0000 THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAHITAN RANGES WERE LIT FOR THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY
2803-154328-0001 THEY HAD ONE NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR BED
2803-154328-0002 THE MEAL ENDED BUT
2803-154328-0003 SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ABEYANCE SOON WEIGHED DOWN THEIR EYELIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WONDERING
2803-154328-0004 IF IT WAS DECREED THAT WE DIE TO MORROW LET US DIE BRAVELY LIKE CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERROR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE
2803-154328-0005 GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT WE HAD A NOBLE END IN VIEWS
2803-154328-0006 GLENARVAN'S VOICE FIRM TILL NOW FALTERED HE
2803-154328-0007 JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISED MARY WHAT I PROMISED LADY HELENA WHAT IS YOUR PLANS
2803-154328-0008 I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FULFILL MY PROMISE
2803-154328-0009 MY LORD WHICH EVER OF US SURVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFILL THE WISH OF LADY HELENA AND MARY GRANT
2803-154328-0010 AT LAST THE MAJOR SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST
2803-154328-0011 THE JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON THE GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS GUARDED
2803-154328-0012 ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THAT ENORMOUS ROCK
2803-154328-0013 YOU LISTEN SAID HE MOTIONING THEM TO STOOP
2803-154328-0014 ANIMAL OR MAN ANSWERED THE MAJOR I CAN SOON FIND OUT
2803-154328-0015 WILSON AND OLBINET JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS AND ALL UNITED TO DIG THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAGGER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WITH THEIR NAILS WHILE MULRADDA STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NATIVE GUARD THROUGH A CREVICE OF THE MATTING
2803-154328-0016 WHO COULD BE THE OBJECT
2803-154328-0017 DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS IT SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISES THAT LED TO THE UNDERTAKING
2803-154328-0018 THEIR FINGERS BLED BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FOOT DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASED SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LAYER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION
2803-154328-0019 YOUNG MANGLES INSERTING THE BLADE OF HIS PONIARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PROTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WIELDED IT
2803-154328-0020 BUT SOFTLY AS A NAME WAS BREATHED MARY GRANT ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARDS GLENARVAN AND SEIZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH THE EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES
2803-154328-0021 WATCH THE STAGES OUTSIDE SAID ROBERT
2803-154328-0022 ON HIS BODY WAS ROLLED A LONG COIL OF FLAX ROPE
2803-154328-0023 MY DEAR CHILD MY CHILD MURMURED LADY HELENA THE SAVAGES DID NOT KILL YOU
2803-161169-0000 AT ONCE THERE WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERYTHING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
2803-161169-0001 THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC THE FOUNTAINS WITH THEIR SONGS
2803-161169-0002 WHY DID HE GIVE HER SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING
2803-161169-0003 AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARNED AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THE ONE STOREHOUSE
2803-161169-0004 THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPES DOWNWARD AND THE WAY COMES DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US
2803-161169-0005 WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOTPATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE LITTLE CARS THAT ARE COMING AND COMING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES
2803-161169-0006 LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL TO YOUR SIDE
2803-161169-0007 SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LYING ASLANT ACROSS A FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STROWED AMONG THEM
2803-161169-0008 HERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ROUNDED LIKE A NUTSHELL YOU CAN SPLIT OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE NUT LYING SNUGLY AS DOES ANY CHESTNUT IN ITS BURS
2803-161169-0009 FERNS AND PLUMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES
2803-161169-0010 FROM WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL
2803-161169-0011 WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD KEPT ON TURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY
2803-161169-0012 THESE FORESTS WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WE HAVE NOW GREAT FERNS AS TALL AS HIS HOUSE AND MOSSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PALM LEAVES OF AN ENORMOUS SIZE
2803-161169-0013 THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOUT THE GROUND
2803-161169-0014 BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSES GOD MADE THE GAS FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANY THING FOR HARM ONLY
2803-161169-0015 IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL EVERY ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT
2803-161169-0016 DON'T YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS AFUSED COAL TAR
2803-161169-0017 WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUGH FROM A COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLYCERIN TO HEAL THEM
2902-9006-0000 ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN ERA LABORS UNDER A TROUBLESOME DISADVANTAGE AND
2902-9006-0001 IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT DISADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR WHILE THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HEINOUS WERE STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THE SINS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH SHE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY TO STATE THE CHURCH'S CASE FAR MORE BRIEFLY THAN THE FACTS DESERVE
2902-9006-0002 NOT BE IT EVER REMEMBERED THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF IMMORALITY ATTACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THAT BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSOPHERS OF HER SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES
2902-9006-0003 THAT DIVINE WORD WHO IS THE LIGHT WHO LIGHTETH EVERY MAN WHICH COMETH TO THE WORLD HAD AWAKENED IN THE HEART OF MANKIND A MORAL CRAVING NEVER BEFORE FELT IN ANY STRENGTH EXCEPT BY A FEW ISOLATED PHILOSOPHERS OR PROPHETS
2902-9006-0004 THE VERY EMPERORS HAD ARRAYED THEMSELVES ON EVERY SIDE
2902-9006-0005 JULIAN'S LAST ATTEMPT TO RESTORE PAGANISM BY IMPERIAL INFLUENCE HAD ONLY PROVED THAT THE OLD FAITH HAD LOST ALL HOLD UPON THE HEARTS OF THE MASSES AT HIS DEATH THE GREAT TIDE WAVE OF NEW OPINION ROLLED ON UNCHECKED AND THE RULERS OF THE EARTH WERE FAIN TO SWIM WITH THE STREAM TO ACCEPT IN WORDS AT LEAST THE CHURCH'S LAWS AS THEIRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A KING OF KINGS TO WHOM EVEN THEY OWED HOMAGE AND OBEDIENCE AND TO CALL THEIR OWN SLAVES THEIR POORER BRETHREN AND OFTEN TOO THEIR SPIRITUAL SUPERIORS
2902-9006-0006 BUT IF THEIR EMPERORS HAD BECOME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAD NOT
2902-9006-0007 IN THE MEANWHILE THE MINDS OF MEN CUT ADRIFT FROM THEIR ANCIENT MOORINGS WANDERED WILDLY OVER PATHLESS SEAS OF SPECULATIVE DOUBT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE METAPHYSICAL AND CONTEMPLATIVE EAST ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE FOR THEMSELVES THE QUESTIONS OF MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNSEEN BY THOSE THOUSAND SCHISMS HERESIES AND THEOSOPHIES IT IS A DISGRACE TO THE WORD PHILOSOPHY TO CALL THEM BY IT ON THE RECORDS OF WHICH THE STUDENT NOW GAZES BEWILDERED UNABLE ALIKE TO COUNT OR TO EXPLAIN THEIR PHANTTASIES
2902-9006-0008 THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCHMEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE SOLVED UNLESS THE CHURCH IS TO RELINQUISH FOREVER HER CLAIMS AS THE GREAT TEACHER AND SATISFIER OF THE HUMAN SOUL
2902-9006-0009 BUT THE HEALTH OF A CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE CREED WHICH IT PROFESSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF A FEW GREAT ECCLESIASTICS BUT ON THE HEALTH AND VIRTUE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS
2902-9006-0010 THE MAN'S SANA MUST HAVE A CORPUS SALMUM TO INHABIT
2902-9006-0011 AND THIS NEW BLOOD AT THE ERA OF THIS STORY WAS AT HAND
2902-9006-0012 TRIBE AFTER TRIBE CROWDING DOWN TO THE ALPS AND TRAMPLING UPON EACH OTHER ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE
2902-9006-0013 THE HUNS SINGLY THEIR INFERIORS PRESSED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS ITALY WITH HER RICH CITIES AND FERTILE LOWLANDS BECKONED THEM ON TO PLUNDER AS AUXILIARIES THEY HAD LEARNED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND A ROMAN WEAKNESS A CASUS BELLI WAS FOUND
2902-9006-0014 HOW INIQUITOUS WAS THE CONDUCT OF THE SONS OF THEODOSIUS IN REFUSING THE USUAL BOUNTY BY WHICH THE GOTHS WERE BRIBED NOT TO ATTACK THE EMPIRE THE WHOLE PENT UP DELUGE BURST OVER THE PLAINS OF ITALY AND THE WESTERN EMPIRE BECAME FROM THAT DAY FORTH A DYING IDIOT WHILE THE NEW INVADERS DIVIDED EUROPE AMONGST THEMSELVES
2902-9006-0015 THE COUNTLESS TREASURES WHICH FIVE CENTURIES OF RAPINE HAD ACCUMULATED AROUND THE CAPITAL HAD BECOME THE PREY OF MEN CLOTHED IN SHEEPSKINS AND HORSEHIDE AND THE SISTER OF AN EMPEROR HAD FOUND HER BEAUTY VIRTUE AND PRIDE OF A RACE WORTHILY MATCHED BY THOSE OF THE HARD HANDED NORTHERN HERO WHO LED HER AWAY FROM ITALY AS HIS CAPTIVE AND HIS BRIDE TO FOUND NEW KINGDOMS IN SOUTH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND TO DRIVE THE NEWLY ARRIVED VANDALS ACROSS THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR INTO THE THEN BLOOMING COASTLAND OF NORTHERN AFRICA
2902-9006-0016 THAT EXTRAORDINARY REFORM IN MORALS WHICH ACCORDING TO SALVIAN AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES THE VANDAL CONQUERERS WORKED IN NORTH AFRICA AVAILED THEM NOTHING THEY LOST MORE THAN THEY GAVE
2902-9006-0017 CLIMATE BAD EXAMPLE AND THE LUXURY OF POWER DEGRADED THEM IN ONE CENTURY INTO A RACE OF HELPLESS AND DEBAUCHED SLAVEHOLDERS DOOMED TO UTTER EXTERMINATION BEFORE THE SEMI GOTHIC ARMIES OF BELISARIUS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE LAST CHANCE THAT THE GOTHIC RACES WOULD EXERCISE ON THE EASTERN WORLD THE SAME STERN YET WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH THE RUSSIAN HAD BEEN RESTORED TO LIFE
2902-9006-0018 THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSIC SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN UNMEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT THAT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOMO IOSEUS AND HOMO AEOSIUS MIGHT HANG THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET TO BATTLE IN ALEXANDRIA THE ANCIENT STRONGHOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THE EFFETE REMAINS OF THE VERY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED ITS EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE
2902-9006-0019 TO CIONYSIUS'S MOST CHARMING LETTERS AS WELL AS TO THOSE OF ISIDORE THE GREAT ABBOT OF PELLUSIUM I BEG LEAVE TO REFER THOSE READERS WHO WISH FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE FIFTH CENTURY
2902-9006-0020 I CANNOT HOPE THAT THESE PAGES WILL BE PARTICULARLY FREE FROM ANACHRONISMS AND ERRORS
2902-9008-0000 THE PLACE SEEMED FRAGRANT WITH ALL THE RICHES OF GREEK THOUGHT AND SONG SINCE THE DAYS WHEN PTOLEMY PHILODOLPHUS WALKED THERE WITH EUCLID AND THEOCRITUS GALOMACHUS AND LYCOPHRON
2902-9008-0001 THE ROOM HAD NEITHER CARPET NOR FIREPLACE AND THE ONLY MOVABLES IN IT WERE A SOFA BED A TABLE AND AN ARMCHAIR ALL OF SUCH DELICATE AND GRACEFUL FORMS AS CAN BE SEEN ON ANCIENT VASES OF A FAR EARLIER PERIOD THAN THAT WHEREOF WE WRITE
2902-9008-0002 BUT MOST PROBABLY HAD ANY OF US ENTERED THAT ROOM THAT MORNING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPARE A LOOK EITHER FOR THE FURNITURE OR THE GENERAL EFFECT OR THE MUSEUM GARDENS OR THE SPARKLING MEDITERRANEAN BEYOND BUT WE SHOULD HAVE AGREED THAT THE ROOM WAS QUITE RICH ENOUGH FOR HUMAN EYES FOR THE SAKE OF THE ONE TREASURE WHICH IT POSSESSED AND BESIDE WHICH NOTHING WAS WORTH A MOMENT'S GLANCE
2902-9008-0003 SHE HAS LIFTED HER EYES OFF HER MANUSCRIPT SHE IS LOOKING OUT WITH KINDLING COUNTENANCE OVER THE GARDENS OF THE MUSEUM HER BRIGHT CURLING GREEK LIPS SUCH AS WE NEVER SEE NOW EVEN AMONG HER OWN WIVES AND SISTERS OPEN
2902-9008-0004 IF THEY HAVE CEASED TO GUIDE NATIONS THEY HAVE NOT CEASED TO SPEAK TO THEIR OWN EQUAL
2902-9008-0005 IF THEY HAVE CAST OFF THE WOLF HERD THEY HAVE NOT CAST OFF HYPATIA
2902-9008-0006 TO BE WELCOMED INTO THE CELESTIAL RANKS OF THE HEROIC TO RISE TO THE IMMORTAL GUARDS TO THE INEFFABLE POWERS ONWARD UPWARD EVER THROUGH AGES AND THROUGH ETERNITIES TILL I FIND MY HOME AT LAST AND VANISH IN THE GLORY OF THE NAMELESS AND THE ABSOLUTE ONE
2902-9008-0007 AY TO BELIEVE AGAINST THE AUTHORITY OF PORFIRY HIMSELF TOO IN EVIL EYES AND MAGICALLY
2902-9008-0008 WHY WHAT DO I CARE FOR FOOD
2902-9008-0009 HOW CAN HE WHOSE SPHERE LIES ABOVE THE STARS STOP EVERY MOMENT TO EARTH
2902-9008-0010 AYE SHE ANSWERED HALF BITTERLY AND WOULD THAT WE COULD LIVE WITHOUT THE FOOD AND IMITATE PERFECTLY THE IMMORTAL GODS
2902-9008-0011 THERE'S FRUIT WITH LENTILS AND RICE WAITING FOR YOU IN THE NEXT ROOM AND BREAD UNLESS YOU DESPISE IT TOO MUCH
2902-9008-0012 STRANGE THAT MEN SHOULD BE CONTENT TO GROVEL AND BE MEN WHEN THEY ONLY RISE TO THE RANK OF GODS
2902-9008-0013 NOT THAT SUCH A CREATURE AS THAT DISTURBS ME NO CREATED THING I HOPE CAN MOVE MY EQUANIMITY BUT IF I COULD STOOP TO HATE I SHOULD HATE HER HATE
2902-9008-0014 AND HER VOICE TOOK A TONE WHICH MADE IT SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN WHETHER IN SPITE OF ALL THE LOFTY IMPASSIBILITY WHICH SHE FELT BOUND TO POSSESS SHE DID NOT HATE PELAGIA WITH A MOST GENUINE AND MUNDANE HATRED
2902-9008-0015 HIS EXCELLENCY NOW THE PREFECT
2902-9008-0016 AND WHY COULD THAT DISTURB ME LET HIM ENTER
3000-15664-0000 SHASTAS RAMBLES AND MODOC MEMORIES
3000-15664-0001 ARCTIC BEAUTY AND DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ALL MAY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLIMBERS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN AS GOING ROUND ITS WARM FERTILE BASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS
3000-15664-0002 PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE QUITE AT LEAST TO HIMSELF
3000-15664-0003 GO QUIETLY ALONE NO HARM WILL BEFAL YOU
3000-15664-0004 BUT IT IS FAR BETTER TO LEAVE AFOOT
3000-15664-0005 ONE PLANET WILL BE ENOUGH TO CARRY OR YOU MAY FOREGO THE PLEASURE AND BURDEN ALTOGETHER AS WOOD FOR FIRES IS EVERYWHERE ABUNDANT
3000-15664-0006 ONLY A LITTLE FOOD WILL BE PREPARED
3000-15664-0007 THUS ONE SAUNTERS ON AND ON IN THE GLORIOUS RADIANCE IN UTTER PEACE AND FORGETFULNESS OF
3000-15664-0008 YET STRANGE TO SAY THERE ARE DAYS EVEN HERE SOMEWHAT DULL LOOKING WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SEEMS UNCOMMUNICATIVE SENTING OUT NO APPRECIABLE INVITATION AS IF NOT AT HOME
3000-15664-0009 AT SUCH TIME ITS HEIGHT SEEMS MUCH LESS AND IF CROUCHING AND WEARY IT WERE TAKING REST
3000-15664-0010 EVERY CRYSTAL DANCES RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCHES OF THE SUN AND THE CURRANTS OF SAP IN THE GROWING CELLS OF ALL THE VEGETATION ARE NEVER IN A VITAL WHIRL AND RUSH AND THOUGH MANY FEET AND WINGS ARE FOLDED HOW MANY ARE ASTIR
3000-15664-0011 SLIGHT RAINSTORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A TRIP ROUND THIS MOUNTAIN BUT ONE MAY EASILY FIND SHELTER BENEATH WELL THATCHED TREES THAT SHED THE RAIN LIKE A ROOF
3000-15664-0012 THEN THE SHINING OF THE WET LEAVES IS DELIGHTFUL AND THE STEAMING FRAGRANCE AND THE BURST OF BIRD SONG FROM A MULTITUDE OF THRUSHES AND FINCHES AND WARBLERS THAT HAVE NESTS IN THE CHAPPARAL
3000-15664-0013 A THOUSAND THOUSAND VOICES ARE HEARD BUT SO FINELY BLENDED THAT SEEM A PART OF THE NIGHT ITSELF AND MAKE A DEEPER SILENCE
3000-15664-0014 AND SETTING OUT FROM STRAWBERRY VALLEY BY BEARING OFF TO THE NORTHWESTWARD A FEW MILES YOU CAN SEE
3000-15664-0015 IN APPROACHING IT ITS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING YELLOW SPOTTED HOOD AND WATCHFUL ATTITUDE WILL BE LIKELY TO MAKE YOU GO CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THAT BOG WHERE IT STANDS AS IF YOU WERE APPROACHING A DANGEROUS SNAKE
3000-15664-0016 IT IS LINED WITH EMERALD ALGAE AND MOSSES AND SHADED BY ALDER WILLOW AND THORN BUSHES WHICH GIVE IT A FINE SETTING
3000-15664-0017 IT IS THREE OR FOUR MILES LONG AND TERMINATES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN MORAINE SHAPED ICE CLIFFS SIXTY FEET HIGH
3000-15664-0018 THE LONG GREY SLOPES LEADING UP TO THE GLACIER SEEMING REMARKABLY SMOOTH AND UNBROKEN
3000-15664-0019 MOST OF THE DRAINAGE OF THE GLACIER VANISHES AT ONCE FROM THE POROUS ROCKS TO APPEAR IN SPRINGS IN THE DISTANT VALLEY AND IT IS ONLY IN TIME OF FLOOD THAT THE CHANNEL CARRIES MUCH WATER THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL FINE FALLS IN THE GORGE SIX HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT
3000-15664-0020 TRACING THIS WILD SHINING CHANNEL GORGE GULLY OR CANYON THE SECTIONS WILL SHOW MOUNT SHASTA AS A HUGE PALAUMPSYST CONTAINING THE RECORDS LAYER UPON LAYER OF STRANGELY CONTRASTED EVENTS IN ITS FIERY ICY HISTORY
3000-15664-0021 REGAINING THE LOW GROUND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HOLDING ON IN YOUR GRAND ORBIT YOU PASS THROUGH A BELT OF JUNIPER WOODS CALLED THE CEDARS TO SHEEPERROCK AT THE FOOT OF THE SHASTA PASS
3000-15664-0022 HERE YOU STRIKE THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD WHICH LEADS OVER THE LOW DIVIDE TO THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNT
3000-15664-0023 AUNT BREMER IS THE MOST NOTED STRONGHOLD OF THE SHEEP IN THE WHOLE SHASTA REGION
3000-15664-0024 LARGE FLOCKS DWELL HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WINTER AND SUMMER DESCENDING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE ADJACENT SAGE PLANTS AND LAVA BEDS TO FEED BUT EVER READY TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE JAGGED CRAGS OF OUR MOUNTAIN AT EVERY ALARUM
3000-15664-0025 WELL TRAVELLING WITH A COMPANY OF HUNTERS I SAW ABOUT FIFTY IN ONE FLOCK
3000-15664-0026 THE NOBLE DEER ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY
3000-15664-0027 THEIR LONG MASSIVE FEATURES GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE
3000-15664-0028 BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOODS ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD MY EYE
3000-15664-0029 THEN HE FELL THE GLOAMING MAKING EVERYTHING STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS
3000-15664-0030 THEN IS DARKNESS LIKE DEATH
3000-15664-0031 TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRONGHOLD OF THE MODOCS HELD BY THEM SO LONG AND DEFIANTLY AGAINST ALL THOSE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK
3000-15664-0032 THE DUCKS LESS WARY KEPT THEIR PLACES MERELY SINGING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND RAISING SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE
3000-15664-0033 THEY ARE BROAD RUGGED CREVASSED CLOUDLIKE MASSES OF A DOWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING AND SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVER LIKE GO WINDING DOWN THE VALLEYS THROUGH THE FORESTS TO THE SEA
3000-15664-0034 THUS THE SHASTA RIVER ISSUES FROM A LARGE LAKE LIKE SPRING IN SHASTA VALLEY AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE VOLUME OF THE MC CLOUD GUSHES FORTH IN A GRAND SPRING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS A FEW MILES BACK FROM ITS IMMEDIATE BASE
3000-15664-0035 SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEM SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO THE VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PIT RIVER THEN YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT
3000-15664-0036 UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YOU MAY HEAR THE ROAR OF THE WATER RUSHING TO THE ROCK AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OR EVEN MORE OR YOU MAY NOT HEAR IT UNTIL WITHIN A FEW RODS
3000-15664-0037 THE VIVID GREEN OF THE BOULDERS BENEATH THE WATER WAS VERY STRIKING AND COLOURS THE ENTIRE STREAM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORTIONS BROKEN INTO FOAM
3000-15664-0038 ASPLENIUM EPILOBIUM HUTCHERA HAZEL DOG WOOD AND ALDER MAKE A LUXURIOUS FRINGE AND SETTING AND THE FORESTS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE ALONG THE BANKS ARE THE FINEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THIS SIERRA
3000-15664-0039 TRACING RIVERS INTO THEIR FOUNTAINS MAKES THE MOST CHARMING OF TRAVELS
3000-15664-0040 AS THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE LANDSCAPES THE BEST OF THE WILDERNESS GOES TO THEIR BANKS AND NOT ONE DULL PASSAGE IS FOUND IN ALL THEIR EVENTFUL HISTORIES
3000-15664-0041 TRACING THE MC CLOUD TO ITS HIGHEST SPRINGS AND OVER THE DIVIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF FALL RIVER NEAR FORT CROOK THENCE DOWN THAT RIVER TO ITS CONFLUENT WITH THE PIT ON FROM THERE TO THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTTE THROUGH THE BIG MEADOWS AMONG THE SOURCES OF THE FEATHER RIVERS AND DOWN THROUGH FORESTS OF SUGAR PINE TO THE FERTILE PLAINS OF CHICO THIS IS A GLORIOUS SAUNTER AND IMPOSES NO HARDSHIP
3000-15664-0042 THE ASCENT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE IS AN EASY WORK AND THE VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT ARE EXTREMELY TELLING
3000-15664-0043 THE LOFTY ICY SHASTA TOWERING HIGH ABOVE ALL SEEMS BUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM YOU THOUGH THE DISTANCE IN AN AIR LINE WAS ABOUT SIXTY MILES
3000-15664-0044 THE BIG MEADOWS LIE NEAR THE FOOT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE A BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS BASIN SET IN THE HEART OF THE RICHLY FORESTED MOUNTAINS SCARCELY SURPASSED IN THE GRANDEUR OF ITS SURROUNDINGS BY TAH
3000-15664-0045 THE GREAT WILDS OF OUR COUNTRY ONCE HELD TO BE BOUNDLESS AND INEXHAUSTIBLE ARE BEING RAPIDLY INVADED AND OVERRUN IN EVERY DIRECTION AND EVERYBODY DESTRUCTIBLE IN THEM IS BEING DESTROYED
3000-15664-0046 AND EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLED AND HARRIED
3081-166546-0000 WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH A FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH HIS CASE
3081-166546-0001 INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY THE GLASS
3081-166546-0002 YES YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
3081-166546-0003 THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE LADIES BUT THEIR AUNT
3081-166546-0004 THE WORDS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
3081-166546-0005 IT GEORGE NODDED
3081-166546-0006 THE BOYS LOOK QUITE AWAKE ENOUGH AS THE FATHER DOES NOT
3081-166546-0007 DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE HOUSE WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
3081-166546-0008 GEORGE HE
3081-166546-0009 HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE
3081-166546-0010 I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATE IS SO IMPROBABLE
3081-166546-0011 THAT BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
3081-166546-0012 A MAN IS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
3081-166546-0013 I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON HIS FURTIVE WATCH
3081-166546-0014 I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM AND WHY
3081-166546-0015 I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW AND
3081-166546-0016 JUST AN EVERYDAY DEDUCTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THROUGH
3081-166546-0017 YES HE'S MERCURIAL IN ALL ITS MOVEMENTS
3081-166546-0018 WHAT DOES HIM WANT
3081-166546-0019 I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE WHO HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
3081-166546-0020 HE WANTS YOU TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME
3081-166546-0021 I EMPHASIZED COMPLACENTLY THIS
3081-166546-0022 HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRYCE' A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE
3081-166546-0023 HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAD ITS ALLEURNMENT FOR HIM
3081-166546-0024 THE TRAVEL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
3081-166546-0025 I WISH WE HAD NOT LIVED SO SOON
3081-166546-0026 HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN ANY EVENING PAPERS
3081-166546-0027 HOWEVER PERHAPS A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT
3081-166546-0028 IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER JACK
3081-166546-0029 THE SUGGESTION SHE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT
3081-166546-0030 THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUSTICE SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
3081-166546-0031 THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE CONTINUED GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
3081-166546-0032 IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE SIN
3081-166546-0033 BUT CLUES THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
3081-166546-0034 THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS WHO CAN
3081-166546-0035 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE FOR
3081-166546-0036 IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRYSON
3081-166546-0037 THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED UP TO THE FLOOR
3081-166546-0038 THEY HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
3081-166546-0039 NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN A FALL
3081-166546-0040 IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN
3081-166546-0041 WHAT DO WE MAKE OF IT GRYCE
3081-166546-0042 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OF AND THAT SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
3081-166546-0043 A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE JUMPED FORWARD
3081-166546-0044 HE WAS THE PLAY FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE
3081-166546-0045 THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGEE'S AND MORE OR LESS OF A CHARACTER
3081-166546-0046 BEND OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE FACE CAREFULLY
3081-166546-0047 VERY WELL WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PIONEER ME
3081-166546-0048 WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST OF ALL EVENTS
3081-166546-0049 BUT I AM IN NO POSITIONS TO MAKE PROMISES
3081-166546-0050 OLD EYES DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
3081-166546-0051 WHETHER HE FOUND ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW
3081-166546-0052 ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THEIR END OF THE HALL
3081-166546-0053 NATURALLY THEY LEFT HER FIRST
3081-166546-0054 MARK SOWERBY AND KLAUS HENKERBERG
3081-166546-0055 HONEST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PAID HERE FOR YEARS
3081-166546-0056 WHO CAME NEXT OF THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LOBBY
3081-166546-0057 ANYBODY BEFORE THE POWER CAME IN
3081-166546-0058 I YES MISS CLARK THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARISHES
3081-166546-0059 I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED BUT I SHOULD SAY
3081-166546-0060 AND AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON
3081-166546-0061 NOT TILL A DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING
3081-166546-0062 YES MASTER SLATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED
3081-166546-0063 HAD NO DOUBT
3081-166546-0064 SWEETWATER SOME ONE DREW THAT RIBBON OUT
3081-166546-0065 SO NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
3081-166546-0066 WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK LONG
3081-166546-0067 IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF FURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
3081-166546-0068 BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN OFF FOR YOU
3081-166546-0069 VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOUR WILL
3081-166546-0070 I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND RHEUMATIC INVALID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN FRIENDS
3081-166546-0071 AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE IN MISTER GRYCE
3081-166546-0072 THERE WAS NO DOUBTING THEM IN THIS INTEREST
3081-166546-0073 NO YES
3081-166546-0074 FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE THREE MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY
3081-166546-0075 SHE YES MANY TIMES
3081-166546-0076 WHAT HAS MADE THE DIFFERENCE
3081-166546-0077 MISS CLARKS STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY
3081-166546-0078 NEVER A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY
3081-166546-0079 AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE CONSIDERED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION
3081-166546-0080 I DO KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW
3081-166546-0081 THERE WAS NO POIGNARD IN THAT WOUND
3081-166546-0082 BUT TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARK WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER
3081-166546-0083 I WILL TROUBLE YOU FURTHER
3081-166546-0084 SWEETWATER HELP ME OUT TO THIS
3081-166546-0085 BUT VIGOR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARK AND TURNED TO MAKE THE ELEVATOR
3081-166546-0086 THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S HANDS
3081-166546-0087 NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWEDS
3081-166546-0088 SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON ABOUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
3081-166546-0089 IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND WHERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
3170-137482-0000 WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE INSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AT RIGHTLY DESPISED
3170-137482-0001 I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE BOYS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY
3170-137482-0002 I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES DO NOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE
3170-137482-0003 BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS GENERAL
3170-137482-0004 OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED ME TO THE GREATEST DANGER
3170-137482-0005 WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKE
3170-137482-0006 WE DID THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING AN EXCELLENT HEALTH
3170-137482-0007 WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS SHUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS
3170-137482-0008 THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS AND
3170-137482-0009 IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MASINO
3170-137482-0010 YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW PERSONS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY
3170-137482-0011 THE WAITER OF THE JAGASINO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH
3170-137482-0012 WE TOOK OUR FOUR PRISONERS TO A LARGE BOAT
3170-137482-0013 WHERE AS MY HUSBAND
3170-137482-0014 NEVER FEAR HE SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW
3170-137482-0015 MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURES BADE US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH
3170-137482-0016 TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE SPOKEN OF
3170-137482-0017 AND WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR BEFORE BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING
3170-137482-0018 THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOTED
3170-137482-0019 I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STAGE I HANDED IT TO HIM
3170-137482-0020 I TOLD HIM AS HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
3170-137482-0021 I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL AROUND THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
3170-137482-0022 I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RIZETTA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I INQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND WENT TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
3170-137482-0023 TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A PHYSICIAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLED AGAIN THUS APPROVING OF THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME
3170-137482-0024 THINKING I HAD THE RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF ROUND HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
3170-137482-0025 THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO TELL ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE
3170-137482-0026 HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND THIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM
3170-137482-0027 THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERO WHO THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION
3170-137482-0028 DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY BACK AGAIN
3170-137482-0029 HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL HIM HIS TRUTH
3170-137482-0030 WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS MIGHT SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
3170-137482-0031 UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS THREE FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMERAL CALCULUS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKED TO PUT
3170-137482-0032 I OBEYED IMPLICITLY AND I MET YOUR EXCELLENCY
3170-137482-0033 THE SEVEN FRIENDS WERE ASTOUNDED
3170-137482-0034 I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OFF AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
3170-137482-0035 HE WROTE THIS QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
3170-137482-0036 IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT A SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
3170-137482-0037 THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULS
3170-137482-0038 NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISHED ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANY ONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION
3170-137482-0039 THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS AND THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT OF EUROPE
3170-137482-0040 BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL YET IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
3170-137482-0041 THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN OLD DEVOTEES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES
3170-137482-0042 AS FOR THE EUCHARIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENCE AND IF THEY WERE NOT JESUITS
3170-137482-0043 I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISHED TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INFINITE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM
3170-137482-0044 BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENA THEY MET WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELLECT COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
3170-137482-0045 WHOEVER THEY MAY BE I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE
3170-137482-0046 YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GONDOLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEQUINS A MINUTE
3170-137482-0047 YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVISER IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING THAT YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND
3170-137482-0048 I THREW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM OUR FATHER
3536-23268-0000 SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH DORRIFORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HORTON THAT LORD FREDERICK'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED THEM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION
3536-23268-0001 EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISS WOODLEY WHO IS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS
3536-23268-0002 YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES LET A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE
3536-23268-0003 NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY FEARS FOR HER WHEN ABROAD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAS BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLAMOR OF HER RETURN
3536-23268-0004 I HOPE MISS MILNER YOU STAY THIS EVENING AT HOME
3536-23268-0005 I FELT MISS MILNER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
3536-23268-0006 YES INDEED AND I KNOW IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT
3536-23268-0007 MISSUS HORTON ROSE FROM HER SEAT MOVED THE DECANTERS AND FRUIT OVER THE TABLE STIRRED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK TO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED
3536-23268-0008 NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFICIOUS LABOURS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF HER SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSTLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE
3536-23268-0009 MISS MILNER I SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR
3536-23268-0010 AS HE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR
3536-23268-0011 HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TILL MISTER HORTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING
3536-23268-0012 IT WAS NOT FROM A REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HERS
3536-23268-0013 DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MILNER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SURPASSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL
3536-23268-0014 IF YOU THINK SO MARY I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW
3536-23268-0015 NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT STIR OUT OF THE ROOM THIS EVENING
3536-23268-0016 MISS WOODLEY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD BUT BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED
3536-23268-0017 AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DORRIFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS APPARENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND
3536-23268-0018 MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE JINGLE OF A TEASPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIETLY
3536-23268-0019 MISSUS HORTON TOO IN THE SELF APPROVING CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE
3536-23268-0020 MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES INCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM
3536-23268-0021 HE COUGHED DRANK HIS TEA ENDEAVOURED TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES LED AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MILNER CAME INTO THE ROOM NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL BUT AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER
3536-23268-0022 DORRIFORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE BARGAINED
3536-23268-0023 AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS HORTON FROM THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUTIFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILNER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA
3536-23268-0024 DORRIFORTH THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME A SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN
3536-23268-0025 AND IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY
3536-23268-0026 FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS EVER SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM
3536-23268-0027 WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT THIS LATE BEHAVIOR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPRESSED
3536-23268-0028 SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST APPEAL SHE DESISTED
3536-23268-0029 ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHOW YOUR SUBMISSION BY OBEYING ME A SECOND TIME TO
3536-23268-0030 KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUMSPECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRICTLY THEY ARE COMPLIED WITH
3536-8226-0000 IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBURGH SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAS NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES
3536-8226-0001 AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BASLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF THIS SERVICE
3536-8226-0002 AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THAT LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOR
3536-8226-0003 IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THO FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL
3536-8226-0004 MISSUS BARSIL WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER
3536-8226-0005 AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS
3536-8226-0006 A DISTINCT PROMISE OF AN HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TRAVELLION ON TRAVELLION'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
3536-8226-0007 OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BASILE
3536-8226-0008 HIS PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BASIL'S LAW
3536-8226-0009 HE CAN'T SUCKLE EM KIN
3536-8226-0010 WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED AN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
3536-8226-0011 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS BEE EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOSOIL IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOSSELL TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD
3536-8226-0012 DRAT EM NOW WHAT IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS
3536-8226-0013 IT'S THAT AS MAKES EN I WON'T SAY WHAT
3536-8226-0014 BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD DE
3536-8226-0015 TREVELION HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
3536-8226-0016 DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BASELL LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELLION
3536-8226-0017 THEN BASLEM CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
3536-8226-0018 BUT TREVELLION WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF THIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
3536-8226-0019 BASIL HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM BY A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
3536-8226-0020 IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOSO TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
3536-8226-0021 PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TRAVELLION
3536-8226-0022 MISSUS OSLE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
3536-8226-0023 BOBSLE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
3536-8226-0024 I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYONE WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TREVILION
3536-8226-0025 IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKID SIR SUGGESTED BASIL
3536-8226-0026 AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GAIT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS MEANING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
3536-8226-0027 AS ALL WORK HAD CEASED WITH HIM
3536-8226-0028 HE'S UP IN TOWN SIR A MINDING IN HIS PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
3536-8226-0029 I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCH CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
3536-8226-0030 BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SOMETIMES
3536-8226-0031 AND BASIL AS HE SAID THIS SURPRISED ALMOST ALOUD
3536-8226-0032 AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BASIL STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY GROUND
3576-138058-0000 MASTER AND MAN DISMOUNTED FROM THEIR BEASTS AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES AT THE FOOT OF THE TREES SANCHO WHO HAD HAD A GOOD NOONTIDE MEAL THAT DAY LET HIMSELF WITHOUT MORE ADO PASSED THE GATES OF DEATH
3576-138058-0001 BUT DON QUIXOTE WHOM THIS THOUGHTS FAR MORE THAN HUNGER KEPT AWAKE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE AND ROAMED IN FANCY TO AND FRO THROUGH ALL SORTS OF PLACES
3576-138058-0002 AT ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THAT CAVE OF MONTESINOS AND SAW DULCINEA TRANSFORMED INTO A COUNTRY WENCH SKIPPING AND MOUNTING UPON HER SHE ASS AGAIN THAT THE WORDS OF THE SAGE MERLIN WERE SOUNDING IN HIS EARS SETTING FORTH THE CONDITIONS TO BE OBSERVED AND THE EXERTIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE DISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA
3576-138058-0003 YOU IS TOUCHING ME AND UNTRUSSING ME
3576-138058-0004 DULCINEA IS PERISHING THOU ART LIVING ON REGARDLESS I AM DYING OF HOPE DEFERRED THEREFORE UNTRUSTS THYSELF WITH A GOOD WILL FOR MINE IT IS HERE IN THIS RETIRED SPOT TO GIVE THEE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND LASHES
3576-138058-0005 SEEING THIS SANCHO GOT UP AND GRAPPLING WITH HIS MASTER HE GRIPPED HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN HIS ARMS GIVEN HIM A TRIP WITH THE HEEL STRETCHED HIM ON THE GROUND ON HIS BACK AND PRESSING HIS RIGHT KNEE ON HIS CHEST HELD HIS HANDS IN HIS OWN SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER MOVE NOR BREATHE
3576-138058-0006 HOW THAT TRAITOR EXCLAIMED DON QUIXOTE
3576-138058-0007 DOST THOU REVOLT AGAINST THY MASTER AS NATURAL LORD
3576-138058-0008 DOST THOU RISE AGAINST HIM WHO GIVEST THEE HIS BREAD
3576-138058-0009 DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS THOUGHTS NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE BUT TO HIS OWN DISCRETION TO WHIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASED
3576-138058-0010 SANCHO ROSE AND REMOVED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SPOT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST ANOTHER TREES HE FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIS HEAD AND PUTTING UP HIS HANDS ENCOUNTERED SOMEBODY'S TWO FEET WITH SHOES AND STOCKINGS ON THEM
3576-138058-0011 HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND MADE FOR ANOTHER TREE WHERE THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE FELL A SHOUTING AND CALLING UPON DON QUIXOTE TO COME AND PROTECT HIM
3576-138058-0012 DON QUIXOTE DID SO AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME AND WHAT HE WAS AFRAID OF
3576-138058-0013 SANCHO REPLIED THAT ALL THE WALLS WERE FULL OF MEN'S FEET AND LEGS
3576-138058-0014 DON QUIXOTE WAS ON FOOT WITH HIS HORSE UNBRIDLED AND HIS LANCE LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND IN SHORT COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS HE THOUGHT IT BEST THEREFORE TO FOLD HIS ARMS AND BOW HIS HEAD AND TO RESERVE HIMSELF FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE OCCASION AND OPPORTUNITY
3576-138058-0015 HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH SEVERAL OF THE PISTOLS THEY CALL PETRONELS IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST
3576-138058-0016 HE SAW THAT HIS SQUIRES FOR SO THEY CALL THOSE WHO FOLLOW THAT TRADE WERE ABOUT TO RIFLE SANCHO PANZA BUT HE ORDERED THEM TO DESIST AND WAS AT ONCE OBEYED AS THE GIRDLE ESCAPED
3576-138058-0017 HE SAW ME HE PAID COURT TO ME I LISTENED TO HIM AND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER I LOVED HIM FOR THERE IS NO WOMAN HOWEVER SECLUDED SHE MAY LIVE OR CLOSE SHE MAY BE KEPT WHO WILL NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES AND DESPAIR FOR LEAVING HER HEADLONG IMPULSES
3576-138058-0018 IN A WORD HE PLEDGED HIMSELF TO BE MINE AND I PROMISED TO BE HIS WITHOUT HAVING MATTERS ANY FURTHER
3576-138058-0019 GIVE ME MY HORSE AND ARMS AND WAIT FOR ME HERE I SHALL GO IN QUEST OF THIS KNIGHT AND DEAD OR ALIVE I WILL MAKE HIM KEEP HIS WORD PLIGHTED TO SO GREAT A BEAUTY
3576-138058-0020 NOBODY NEED HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT SAID SANCHO FOR MY MASTER HAS A VERY HAPPY KNACK OF MATCHMAKING IT'S NOT MANY DAYS SINCE HE FORCED ANOTHER MAN TO MARRY WHO IN THE SAME WAY BACKED OUT OF HIS PROMISE TO ANOTHER MAIDEN AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIS PERSECUTORS THE ENCHANTER'S CHANGING THE MAN'S PROPER SHAPE INTO A LACKEY'S THE SAID MAIDEN WOULD NOT BE ONLY THIS MINUTE
3576-138058-0021 WE MADE HASTE TO OVERTAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY MOVED SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH EASE
3576-138058-0022 THE WOUNDED GENTLEMAN OPENED HIS ALL BUT CLOSED EYES AND RECOGNIZING CLAUDIA SAID I SEE CLEARLY POOR AND MISTAKEN LADY THAT IT IS THOU THAT HAST SLAIN ME A PUNISHMENT NOT MERITED OR DESERVED BY MY FEELINGS TOWARDS THEE FOR NEVER DID I MEAN TO NOR COULD I WRONG THEE IN THOUGHT OR DEED
3576-138058-0023 IT IS NOT TRUE THEN SAID CLAUDIA THAT THOU WERT GOING THIS MORNING TO MARRY LEONORA THE DAUGHTER OF THE RICH BALVESTRA
3576-138058-0024 ON SEEING THIS CLAUDIA WHEN SHE HAD CONVINCED HERSELF THAT HER BELOVED HUSBAND WAS NO MORE RENT THE AIR WITH HER SIGHS AND MADE THE HEAVENS RING WITH HER LAMENTATIONS SHE TORE HER HAIR AND SCATTERED IT TO THE WINDS SHE BEAT HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AND SHOWED ALL THE SIGNS OF GRIEF AND SORROW THAT COULD BE CONCEIVED TO COME FROM AN AFFLICTED HEART

3576-138058-0028 CLAUDIA TOLD HER SHE MEANT TO GO TO A MONASTERY OF WHICH AN AUNT OF HERS WAS ABASE WHERE SHE INTENDED TO PASS HER LIFE WITH A BETTER AND EVERLASTING SPOUSE
3576-138058-0029 CLAUDIA WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT ALLOW HIM TO ACCOMPANY HER AND THANKING HIM FOR HIS OFFERS AS WELL AS SHE COULD TOOK LEAVE OF IT IN TEARS

3576-138058-0037 THE CAPTAINS SHOWED PLAINLY THE CONCERN THEY FELT THE REGENT'S LEG WAS DOWNCAST AND THE PILGRIMS DID NOT AT ALL ENJOY SEEING THEIR PROPERTY CONFISCATED
3576-138058-0038 THE REGENT'S LADY ORDERED ONE OF HER SERVANTS TO GIVE HER EIGHTY CROWNS THAT HAD BEEN ASSESSED AS HER SHARE AT ONCE FOR THE CAPTAINS HAD ALREADY PAID DOWN THEIR SIXTY
3576-138058-0039 ONE OF THE SQUIRES OBSERVED IN HIS MIXTURE OF GASCON AND CATALAN THIS CAPTAIN OF OURS WOULD MAKE A BETTER FRIAR THAN OUR HIGHWAYMAN IF HE WANTS TO BE SO GENEROUS ANOTHER TIME LET IT BE WITH HIS OWN PROPERTY AND NOT OURS

3752-4944-0018 I SUPPOSE SEVERITY IS NECESSARY RETURNED MITKIN THOUGH TO MY EARS A FLOGGING SOUNDS A LITTLE DISTASTEFUL

3752-4944-0021 SO THEY WENT ON TO THE VERANDA AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE LIGHTS OF THE PRISON AND LISTENED TO THE SEA LAPPING THE SHORES
3752-4944-0022 BY AND BY A SHORT FIGURE SMOKING A CHEROOT CAME UP OUT OF THE DARK AND PROVED TO BE DOCTOR MACKLEWANE WHO HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM ATTENDING THE DINNER BY REASON OF AN ACCIDENT TO A CONSTABLE AT NORFOLK BAY WHICH HAD CLAIMED HIS PROFESSIONAL ATTENTION

3752-4944-0035 HE SLEEPS AT THE BACK AND NORTH HURRIED THROUGH
3752-4944-0036 AN IMPULSIVE GENTLEMAN SAID MEKIN TO MACKELWAIN AS THE SOUND OF MISTER NORTH'S FOOTSTEPS DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE
3752-4944-0037 MACK WILLWAYNE SHOOK HIS HEAD SERIOUSLY
3752-4944-0038 HE WAS THE STRANGEST FITS AT TIMES
3752-4944-0039 UNLESS IT'S A CANCER IN THE STOMACH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT CAN BE CANCER IN THE STOMACHS

3752-4944-0046 I'VE GIVEN MY ORDERS SIRE
3752-4944-0047 THEN CAPTAIN BURGESS CRIED NORTH HIS PALE FACE FLUSHED I TELL YOU THE BOY'S BLOOD WILL BE ON YOUR HEAD
3752-4944-0048 I' AM A MINISTER OF GOD SIR AND I FORBID YOU TO COMMIT THIS CRIME
3752-4944-0049 DAMNS YOUR IMPERTINENCE SIR BURST OUT BURGESS
3752-4944-0050 YOU'RE A DISMISSED OFFICER OF THE GOVERNMENT SAID
3752-4944-0051 THIS OF COURSE WAS MERE BRAVADO ON THE PART OF OUR COMMANDANT
3752-4944-0052 NORTH KNEW WELL THAT HE WOULD NEVER DARE TO ATTEMPT ANY SUCH ACT OF VIOLENCE BUT THE INSTINCT STUNG HIM LIKE THE CUT OF A WHIP
3752-4944-0053 SHOW MISTER NORTH OUT HE SAID AND GO DOWN INTO THE BARRACKS AND TELL TROKE THAT KIRKLIN IS TO HAVE A HUNDRED LASHES TO MORROW
3752-4944-0054 I'LL SHOW YOU WHO'S MASTER HERE MY GREAT SIR

3752-4944-0057 THEY SHALL NOT FLOG THAT BOY HE ANSWERED
3752-4944-0058 I'LL REPORT THIS TO THAT GOVERNMENT
3752-4944-0059 I WISH I HADN'T TAKEN THAT BRANDY HE SAID FOOL WHAT I AM
3752-4944-0060 O GOD GIVE ME STRENGTH AID ME HELP YOU
3752-4944-0061 I LORD LOOK DOWN UPON ME
3752-4944-0062 HE MIXT A TEASPOONFUL OF THIS IN A PANNIKIN OF WATER AND DRANK IT
3752-4944-0063 IT LEAVED HIM FOR A WHILE
3752-4944-0064 IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD REACHED THE CRISIS OF THAT DISEASE WHICH HAD BEEN FOR DAYS GATHERING FORCE
3752-4944-0065 I MUST HAVE A TEASPOONSFUL HE SAID TO ALLAY THE CRAVING
3752-4944-0066 TWICE HE PAUSED ON THE WAY TO THE CITY ROOM AND TWICE WAS HE DRIVEN ON BY A POWER STRONGER THAN HIS WILL
3752-4944-0067 HE SMELT THE NUTTY AROMA OF ITS SPIRIT
3752-4944-0068 THAT AT ALL TIMES DEBASING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME IT WAS INFAMOUS THAT A VICE UNWORTHY OF ANY MAN WAS DOUBLY SINFUL IN A MAN OF EDUCATION AND A MINISTER OF GOD IN FINE
3752-4944-0069 IN THE MIDST OF THESE ARGUMENTS HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE CUPBOARD WITH THE BOTTLE AT HIS LIPS IN AN ATTITUDE THAT WAS AT ONCE LUDICROUS AND HORRIBLE
3853-163249-0000 HER MEETING WITH LETTY WAS INDESCRIBABLY TENDER BUT THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN NURSING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER
3853-163249-0001 BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEGRUDGED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS THOUGH THE DREAM WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID
3853-163249-0002 SO CHRISTIE TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HER PROPHETIC FATHER AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE BLISSFUL HOLIDAY THAT HAD COME AT LAST
3853-163249-0003 NOTHING CAN SURPRISE ME NOW I'M PREPARED FOR ANYTHING ANYTHING EVEN THE SIGHT OF MY QUAKERISH LOVER DANCING A JIG
3853-163249-0004 I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST ENJOY OUR LIBERTY IN SOME WAY
3853-163249-0005 I'M NOT A TALKER YOU KNOW AND AS THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION FORBID MY SOARING ALOFT NOWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UPLIFTED STATE OF MIND BY PRANCING AS YOU CALL IT
3853-163249-0006 I DON'T WANT YOU TO I LOVE TO SEE YOU SO YOUNG AND HAPPY ONLY YOU ARE NOT THE OLD DOG AND I'VE GOT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW ONE
3853-163249-0007 I HOPE YOU LL LIKE HIM BETTER THAN THE FROSTBITTEN OLD DAVID YOU FIRST KNEW AND WERE KIND ENOUGH TO LOVE
3853-163249-0008 MOTHER SAYS I'VE GONE BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE WE USED LETTY AND I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF I HAD
3853-163249-0009 IN THAT CASE YOU WILL FIND ME A PROUD IMPETUOUS AMBITIOUS FELLOW CRISTED AND HOW WILL THAT SUIT
3853-163249-0010 EXCELLENTLY I LIKE PRIDE OF YOUR SORT IMPETUOSITY BECOMES TO YOU FOR YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL IT IF NEED BE AND THE AMBITION IS BEST OF ALL
3853-163249-0011 I SHALL WAIT FOR TIME TO ASK
3853-163249-0012 THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR WORK LITTLE DREAMING AS THEY TIED ROSES AND TWINED SIMULETS WREATHS HOW NEAR THAT OTHER CHANCE WAS HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE AND HOW WELL EACH WAS TO PERFORM THE PART GIVEN THEM IN LIFE AND DEATH
3853-163249-0013 TO NO HOME IN THE LAND DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN TO THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LANE
3853-163249-0014 DAVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A START IN HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UNSPOKEN APPREHENSION
3853-163249-0015 IT IS TERRIBLE AND YET NOT GLORIOUS
3853-163249-0016 DAVID HELD IT CLOSE IN BOTH OF HIS SAYING GRATEFULLY THANK YOU MOTHER BUT FIXING HIS EYES ON THE YOUNGER YET NOT DEARER WOMEN HE ADDED WITH A RING IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THEIR HEARTS ANSWER WITH A PROMPT AYE AYE IN SPITE OF LOVE OR FEAR
3853-163249-0017 THE BOYS BLESS THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE NOBLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE NEEDED NOW WE CANNOT SACRIFICE ALL THESE GALLANT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN THEY MUST TAKE OUR TURN AND TRY TO DO AS WELL
3853-163249-0018 YES DAVID SISTERS AND SWEETHEART ANSWERED BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FERVOR OF THE MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD
3853-163249-0019 BENNETT WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND THE GREENHOUSE OFF MY HANDS THE AUTUMN FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE
3853-163249-0020 HE'S A KIND NEIGHBOURLY MAN AND HIS BOY WILL TAKE MY PLACE AROUND THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOU FAITHFULLY
3853-163249-0021 I KNEW YOU WOULD DROP I SAW YOU GETTING READY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO FOLLOW
3853-163249-0022 YOU SHALL LET ME DO IT AND IN RETURN I WILL MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK ME ANSWERED CHRISTIE SEALING THE PROMISE WITH A KISS THAT SILENCED HIM
3853-163249-0023 YOU'VE SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SEE IT IN YOUR FACE DEAR I MUST LOOK
3853-163249-0024 NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STERLING SAT ALONE IN THE TWILIGHT A TALL MAN IN ARMY BLUE ENTERED QUIETLY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQUIL FIGURE FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KNELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH THE MOST UNSOLDERLY CHOKE IN THE VOICE
3853-163249-0025 THE MORAL FRENZY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
3853-163249-0026 IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY KNAPSACKS TO HAVE ALL THE GIFTS SHOWERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS
3853-163249-0027 FINDING THAT LYCIA SHOWED LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROUSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VARIOUS SORTS
3853-163249-0028 VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WILKINS RESOLUTELY TO HERSELF IF I CAN'T MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SOUL I WILL OF HIS STOMACH AND SEE HOW THAT'LL WORK
3853-163249-0029 WE CAN'T AFFORD NO NICE FIDDLES NOW WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERIN SOME
3853-163249-0030 HE WAS NOT AS UNMOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SUNDRY MANLY IMPULSES TO UP IN ATOMS WHEN HIS COMRADES IN THE SHOP DISCUSSED THE CRISIS WITH IREFUL BRANDISHING OF AWLS AND VENGEFUL POUNDING OF SOUL LEATHER AS IF THE REBELS WERE UNDER THE HAMMER
3853-163249-0031 TO SAY THAT THE FISH ROSE AT ONCE AND SWALLOWED THE BAIT HOOK AND ALL BUT FEEBLY EXPRESSES THE JUSTICE DONE TO HIS CAKES BY THAT LONG SUFFERING MAN
3853-163249-0032 CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HEPSEY TOLD US AND CALL THEM POOR LONG SUFFERING CRETUR'S NAMES
3853-163249-0033 NO HE AIN'T IT'S A TRAINER ADDED DAN LIZZIE
3853-163249-0034 NOW CYNTHIA BE YOU OUTSIDE
3853-163249-0035 AND THE INCONSISTENT WOMAN FELL UPON HIS BUTTONLY BREAST WEEPING COPIOUSLY
3853-163249-0036 HIS WIFE FED HIM WITH THE FAT OF THE LAND REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVOLVED ABOUT HIM WITH TIRELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLOCKED IN TO APPLAUD ADVICE AND ADMIRE EVERY ONE TREATED HIM WITH THE RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCREASED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND BORE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
3853-163249-0037 THEN THE GOOD SOUL OPENLY SHOULDERED HER BURDEN SHE HAD BORNE SO LONG IN SECRET AND BRAVELY TRUDGED ON ALONE
3853-163249-0038 THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WORK TO LOOK AND LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY MINUTE WAS PRECIOUS
3853-163249-0039 THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT A WORD AND MISSUS STERLING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD
3853-163249-0040 NOW LET'S BE BRAVE AND ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF YOU
3853-163249-0041 WE WILL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU DAVY ASKED CHRISTIE WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GONE TOO
3853-163249-0042 AS THE MARRIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEED YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED HERE FOR HE COULD NOT ADD AS MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PENSION TO SUPPORT YOU
3853-163249-0043 NOTHING CAN PART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR LOVE LIKE OURS WILL LAST FOR LIFE
3853-163249-0044 NOT ONE DAVID THAT IT'S TRUE LOVE CHRISTIE
3853-163249-0045 THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THE SILENCE THE TWO FATHERS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TONGUE CAN UTTER
3853-163249-0046 SURELY I SHALL IF I GIVE YOU AND MY SELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNOW THAT MY HEART HAS GOT TO ACHE AS IT NEVER HAS ACHED YET WHEN MY COURAGE FAILS AS IT WILL BY AND BY AND MY SELFISH SOUL COUNTS THE COST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER
3853-163249-0047 DAVID CAUGHT THE EXALTATION AND GAVE NO FURTHER THOUGHT OF ANYTHING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER AND BRAVER FOR THAT LONG LOOK INTO THE ILLUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
3853-163249-0048 THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMIND ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR MY DEAD BABY'S LITTLE COFFIN
3853-163249-0049 BUT I THINK FEW BRIDES DRESS WITH A BRAVER HAPPIER HEART THAN MINE THOUGH I DO CHOOSE A SOBER WEDDING GOWN ANSWERED CHRISTIE SMILING AGAIN AS SHE TOOK FROM A HALF PACKED TRUNK HER NEW SUIT OF SOFT GRAY WOOLEN STUFF
3853-163249-0050 MISTER POWER IS WAITING AND ARE YOU READY LOVE QUITE READY
3853-163249-0051 WE YOUNG FOLKS TAKE A WEDDING TRIP TO THE GREEN HOUSE WHILE WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU
3853-163249-0052 DAVID AND CHRISTIE WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHED ANY TEARS OVER THE BRIEF HAPPINESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOYALLY KEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP INTO THEIR TENDER HEARTS
3853-163249-0053 A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRIAGE FEAST BUT MORE LOVE GOOD WILL AND TENDER FEELINGS ADORNED THE PLAIN TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND AT WEDDING BREAKFASTS AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEECH OR SONG WAS LETTY'S BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS ROUND DAVID'S EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESS AND KEEP AND BRING HIM BACK TO US
3853-163249-0054 ALL WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BREATH AND PROUD SOULS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW AND BRIGHT WITH A STEELY GLITTER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET IN A WAY TO JOIN A SEA OF DAUNTLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND EBBED BACK REDDENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE
3853-163249-0055 THEN SHE SAW DAVID AND THE REGIMENT BECAME ONE MEN TO HER
3853-163249-0056 I COULD NOT LOVE THEE DEAR SO MUCH LOVED I NOW HONOR MORE
422-122949-0000 EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND SO IT WILL ALWAYS BE A SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADUATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS AND REQUIRING SLAVERY IN SOME FORM OR OTHER
422-122949-0001 THE DISTINCTIONS OF MORAL VALUES HAVE NEITHER ORIGINATED IN A RULING CASTE PLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS OF BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE RULED OR AMONG THE RULED CLASS THE SLAVES AND DEPENDENTS OF ALL SORTS
422-122949-0002 WE' TRUTHFUL ONES THE NOBILITY IN ANCIENT GREECE CALLED THEMSELVES
422-122949-0003 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERYWHERE THE DESIGNATIONS OF MORAL VALUE WERE AT FIRST APPLIED TO MEN AND WERE ONLY DERIVATIVELY AND AT A LATER PERIOD APPLIED TO ACTIONS IT IS A GROSS MISTAKE THEREFORE WHEN HISTORIANS OF MORALS STARTS WITH QUESTIONS LIKE WHY HAVE SYMPATHETIC ACTIONS BEEN PRAISED
422-122949-0004 HE HONORS WHATEVER HE RECOGNIZES IN HIMSELF SUCH MORALITY EQUALS SELF GLORIFICATION IT
422-122949-0005 PROBABLY A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION WITH REGARD TO THE ENTIRE SITUATION OF THE MAN WILL FIND EXPRESSION PERHAPS A CONDEMNATION OF MAN TOGETHER WITH HIS SITUATION
422-122949-0006 HERE IS THE SEAT OF THE ORIGINS OF THE FAMOUS ANTITHESIS GOOD AND EVIL POWER AND DANGEROUSNESS ARE ASSUMED TO RESIDE IN THE EVIL A CERTAIN DREADFULNESS SUBTLETY AND STRENGTH WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF BEING DESPISED
422-122949-0007 ACCORDING TO SLAVE MORALITY THEREFORE THE EVIL MAN AROUSES FEAR ACCORDING TO MASTER MORALITY IT IS PRECISELY THE GOOD MAN WHO AROUSES FEAR AND SEEKS TO AROUSE IT WHILE THE BAD MAN WAS REGARDED AS THE DESPICABLE BEING
422-122949-0008 EVERYWHERE WHERE THAT SLAVE MORALITY GAINS THE ASCENDENCY LANGUAGE SHOWS A TENDENCY TO APPROXIMATE THE SIGNIFICATIONS OF THE WORD GOOD AND STUPID
422-122949-0009 OR HE WILL EVEN SAY FOR MANY REASONS I CAN DELIGHT IN THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE I LOVE AND HONOUR THEM AND REJOICE IN ALL THEIR JOYS PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE THEIR GOOD OPINION INDORSES AND STRENGTHENS MY BELIEF IN MY OWN GOOD OPINION AND PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS EVEN IN CASES WHERE I DO NOT SHARE IT IS USEFUL TO ME OR GIVES PROMISE OF USEFULNESS ALL THIS HOWEVER IS NOT VANITY
422-122949-0010 IN FACT CONFORMABLY TO THE SLOW RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL ORDER AND ITS CAUSE THE BLENDING OF THE BLOOD OF MASTERS AND SLAVES THE ORIGINAL NOBLE AND RARE IMPULSE OF THE MASTERS TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO THEMSELVES AND TO THINK WELL OF THEMSELVES WILL NOW BE MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED AND EXTENDED BUT IT HAS AT ALL TIMES AN OLDER AMPLER AND MORE RADICALLY INGRAINED PROPENSITY OPPOSED TO IT AND IN THE PHENOMENON OF SANITY THIS OLDER PROPENSITY OVERMASTERS THE YOUNGER
422-122949-0011 THE MOST VARIED EXPERIENCE TEACHES IT WHERE ARE THE QUALITIES TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY OWES THE FACT THAT IT STILL EXISTS IN SPITE OF ALL GODS AND MEN AND HAS HITHERTO BEEN VICTORIOUS THESE QUALITIES IT CALLS VIRTUES AND THESE VIRTUES ALONE IT DEVELOPS TO MATURITY
422-122949-0012 VARIATIONS WHETHER THEY BE DEVIATIONS INTO THE HIGHER FINER AND RARER OR DETERIORATIONS AND MONSTROSITIES APPEAR SUDDENLY ON THE SCENE IN THE GREATEST EXUBERANCE AND SPLENDOR THE INDIVIDUAL DARES TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND ATTACHED HIMSELF
422-122949-0013 AT THIS TURNING POINT OF HISTORY THERE MANIFESTS THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE AND OFTEN MIXED AND ENTANGLED TOGETHER A MAGNIFICENT MANIFOLD VIRGIN FOREST LIKE UPGROWTH AND UP STRIVING A KIND OF TROPICAL TEMPO IN THE RIVALRY OF GROWTH AND AN EXTRAORDINARY DECAY AND SELF DESTRUCTION OWING TO THE SAVAGELY OPPOSING AND SEEMINGLY EXPLODING EGOTISMS WHICH STRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR SUN AND LIGHT AND CAN NO LONGER ASSIGN ANY LIMIT RESTRAINT OR FORBEARANCE FOR THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF THE HITHERTO EXISTING MORALITY
422-122949-0014 NOTHING BUT NEW WHINES NOTHING BUT NEW HOWS NO COMMON FORMULAS ANY LONGER MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISREGARD IN LEAGUE WITH EACH OTHER DECAY DETERIORATION AND THE LOFTIEST DESIRES FRIGHTFULLY ENTANGLED THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVERFLOWING FROM ALL THE CORNUCOPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD A PORTENTOUS SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF SPRING AND AUTUMN FULL OF NEW CHARMS AND MYSTERIES PECULIAR TO THE FRESH STILL EXHAUSTED STILL UNWEARIED CORRUPTION
422-122949-0015 DANGER IS AGAIN PRESENT THE MOTHER OF MORALITY GREAT DANGER THIS TIME SHIFTED INTO THE INDIVIDUAL INTO THE NEIGHBOR OR FRIEND INTO THE STREET INTO THEIR OWN CHILD INTO THEIR OWN HEART INTO ALL THE MOST PERSONAL AND SECRET RECESSES OF THEIR DESIRES AND VOLITIONS
422-122949-0016 WHEN WILL THE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS WHO APPEAR AT THIS TIME HAVE TO PREACH
422-122949-0017 THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF OUR RACE
422-122949-0018 IN OUR VERY DEMOCRATIC OR RATHER VERY PLEBEIAN AGE EDUCATION AND CULTURE SHOULD BE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF DECEIVING DECEIVING WITH REGARD TO ORIGIN WITH REGARD TO THE INHERITED PLEBEIANISM IN BODY AND SOUL
422-122949-0019 THE NOBLE SOUL ACCEPTS THE FACT OF HIS EGOISM WITHOUT QUESTION AND ALSO WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS OF HARSHNESS CONSTRAINT OR ARBITRARINESS THEREIN BUT RATHER IS SOMETHING WHICH MAY HAVE ITS BASIS IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF THINGS IF HE SOUGHT A DESIGNATION FOR IT HE WOULD SAY IT IS JUSTICE ITSELF
422-122949-0020 ON THIS ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE OF ONE NATION UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN THOSE BELONGING TO DIFFERENT NATIONS EVEN WHEN THEY USE THE SAME LANGUAGE OR RATHER WHEN PEOPLE HAVE LIVED LONG TOGETHER UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE SOIL DANGER A REQUIREMENT TOIL THERE ORIGINATES THEREFROM AN ENTITY THAT UNDERSTANDS ITSELF NAMELY A NATION
422-122949-0021 THE GREATER THE DANGERS THE GREATER IS THE NEED OF AGREEING QUICKLY AND READILY ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY NOT TO MISUNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER IN DANGER THAT IS WHAT CANNOT AT ALL BE DISPENSED WITH IN INTERCOURSE
422-122949-0022 ALSO IN ALL LOVES AND FRIENDSHIPS ONE HAS THE EXPERIENCE THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND CONTINUES WHEN THIS DISCOVERY HAS BEEN MADE THAT IN USING THE SAME WORDS ONE OF THE TWO PARTIES HAS FEELINGS THOUGHTS INTUITIONS WISHES OR FEARS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE OTHER
422-122949-0023 WHICHEVER GROUPS OF SENSATIONS WITHIN A SOUL AWAKEN MOST READILY BEGIN TO SPEAK AND GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND THIS DECIDE AS TO THE GENERAL ORDER OF RANK OF ITS VALUES AND DETERMINE ULTIMATELY ITS LIST OF DESIRABLE THINGS
422-122949-0024 A MAN'S ESTIMATES OF VALUE BETRAY SOMETHING OF THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SOUL AND WHEREIN IT SEES ITS CONDITIONS OF LIFE ITS INTRINSIC NEED
422-122949-0025 PROFOUND SUFFERING MAKES NOBLE IT SEPARATES ONE OF THE MOST REFINED FORMS OF DISGUISE IS EPICURISM ALONG WITH A CERTAIN OSTENTATIOUS BOLDNESS OF TASTE WHICH TAKES SUFFERING LIGHTLY AND PUTS HERSELF ON THE DEFENSIVE AGAINST ALL THAT IS SORROWFUL AND PROFOUND
422-122949-0026 THE HIGHEST INSTINCT FOR PURITY PLACES HIM WHO IS AFFECTED WITH IT IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND DANGEROUS ISOLATION AS A SIN FOR IT IS JUST HOLINESS THE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE INSTINCT IN QUESTION
422-122949-0027 OCCASIONALLY TOO THE WAKING CALL COMES TOO LATE THE CHANCE WHICH GIVES PERMISSION TO TAKE ACTION WHEN THEIR FIRST YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR ACTION HAVE BEEN USED UP IN SITTING STILL AND HOW MANY A ONE JUST AS HE SPRANG UP HAS FOUND WITH HORROR THAT HIS LIMBS ARE BENUMBED AND HIS SPIRITS ARE NOW TOO HEAVY
422-122949-0028 AND WHOEVER THOU ART WHAT IS IT THAT NOW PRAYS THEE
422-122949-0029 ONLY NAME IT WHATEVER I HAVE I WANT THEE
422-122949-0030 BUT YOU MISUNDERSTAND HIM WHEN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS
422-122949-0031 THERE MUST BE A SORT OF REPUGNANCE IN ME TO BELIEVE ANYTHING DEFINITE ABOUT MYSELF IS THERE PERHAPS SOME A ENIGMA THEREIN
422-122949-0032 PROBABLY BUT FORTUNATELY NOTHING BUT MY OWN TEETH PERHAPS IT BETRAYS THE SPECIES TO WHICH I BELONG BUT NOT TO MYSELF AS IT IS SUFFICIENTLY AGREEABLE TO ME BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
422-122949-0033 I DO NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY PERHAPS THE HARPIES HAVE FLOWN OVER MY GARDEN
422-122949-0034 TO SUFFOCATE WITH HIS FEELINGS TO HIM WHO HAS THE DESIRES OF A LOFTY AND DAINTY SOUL AND ONLY SELDOM FINDS HIS TABLE LAID AND HIS FOOD PREPARED THE DANGER WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT NOWADAYS HOWEVER IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY SO
422-122949-0035 AND TO CHOOSE FOR COMPANY THAT ROGUISH AND TEARFUL VICE POLITENESS
5338-24615-0000 IT WAS ABOUT NOON WHEN CAPTAIN WAVERLEY ENTERED THE STRAGGLING VILLAGE OR RATHER HAMLET OF TULEY VALLON CLOSE TO WHICH WAS SITUATED THE MANSION OF THE PROPRIETOR
5338-24615-0001 THE HOUSES SEEMED MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME AND ESPECIALLY TO AN EYE ACCUSTOMED TO THE SMILING NEATNESS OF ENGLISH COTTAGES
5338-24615-0002 OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHEN SUCH A CONSUMMATION SEEMED INEVITABLE A WATCHFUL OLD GRANDAM WITH HER CLOSE CALF DISTAFF AND SPINDLE RUSHED LIKE A SYBIL IN FRENZY OUT OF ONE OF THESE MISERABLE CELLS DASHED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH AND SNATCHING UP HER OWN CHARGE FROM AMONG THE SUNBURNT LOITERERS SALUTED HIM WITH A SOUND CUFF AND TRANSPORTED HIM BACK TO HIS DUNGEON THE LITTLE WHITE HEADED VARLET SCREAMING ALL THE WHILE FROM THE VERY TOP OF HIS LUNGS A THRILLY TREBLE TO THE GROWLING REMONSTRANCES OF THE ENRAGED MATRON
5338-24615-0003 THE EVILS AND REMEDY SUCH AS IT IS STILL EXIST BUT THIS IS REMOTE FROM OUR PRESENT PURPOSE AND IS ONLY THROWN OUT FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE COLLECTORS UNDER MISTER DENT'S DOGBILL
5338-24615-0004 YET THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED WAS FAR FROM EXHIBITING THE INDIFFERENCE OF STUPIDITY THEIR FEATURES WERE ROUGH BUT REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT GRAVE BUT THE VERY REVERSE OF STUPID AND FROM AMONG THE YOUNG WOMEN THE ARTIST MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MORE THAN ONE MODEL WHOSE FEATURES AND FORM RESEMBLED THOSE OF MINERVA
5338-24615-0005 THIS AVENUE IS STRAIGHT AND OF MODERATE LENGTH RUNNING BETWEEN A DOUBLE ROW OF VERY ANCIENT HORSE CHESTNUTS PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH SYCAMORES WHICH ROSE TO SUCH HUGE HEIGHTS AND NOURISHED SO LUXURIANTLY THAT THEIR BOUGHS COMPLETELY OVERARCHED THE BROAD ROAD BENEATH
5338-24615-0006 IT WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFECTS WHICH A PAINTER LOVES TO REPRESENT AND MINGLED WELL WITH THE STRONG LIGHT WHICH FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE BOUGHS OF THE SHADY ARK THAT VAULTED THE BROAD GREEN ALLEY
5338-24615-0007 THE HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO CONSIST OF TWO OR THREE HIGH NARROW AND STEEP ROOFED BUILDINGS PROJECTING TOWARDS EACH OTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE
5338-24615-0008 IT HAD BEEN BUILT AT A PERIOD WHEN CASTLES WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY AND WHEN THE SCOTTISH ARCHITECTS HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED THE ART OF DESIGNING A DOMESTIC RESIDENCES
5338-24615-0009 NEITHER DID THE FRONT INDICATE ABSOLUTE SECURITY FOR DANGER
5338-24615-0010 STABLES AND OTHER OFFICES OCCUPIED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE
5338-24615-0011 TWO BATTLEMENTED WALLS ONE OF WHICH FACED THE AVENUE AND THE OTHER DIVIDED THE COURT FROM THE GARDEN COMPLETED THIS ENCLOSURE
5338-24615-0012 THIS WORK OF ART WAS THE WONDER OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND AND
5338-24615-0013 THE COURT WAS SPACIOUS WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE STABLES BUT REMOVING THE LITTER
5338-24615-0014 EVERYTHING AROUND APPEARED SOLITARY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT BUT FOR THE CONTINUED PLASHING OF THE FOUNTAIN AND THE WHOLE SCENE STILL MAINTAINED THE MONASTIC ILLUSION WHICH THE FANCIES OF WAVERLEY HAD CONJURED UP
5338-24640-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY TWO A CONFIDANTE
5338-24640-0001 MISTER MORTON REPLIED THEY FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAIM UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESERVING IT
5338-24640-0002 EVIL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER MORTON OR HE HOLDS CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND CEREMONIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE GAUGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH OR MORAL VIRTUE
5338-24640-0003 MISTER MORTON SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAVERLEY'S VISITS TO DONALD BEAN LEAN
5338-24640-0004 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WAVERLEY ON ANY SUCH HAIR BRAINED EXPEDITION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE HAD INEXPRESSIBLE CHARMS FOR ME
5338-24640-0005 HE CERTAINLY POSSESSES TALENTS BEYOND THE RUDE SPHERE IN WHICH HE MOVES BUT BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR ENCUMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS
5338-24640-0006 MISTER MORTON THEN MADE A CAREFULLY MEMORANDUM OF THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAVERLEY'S INTERVIEW WITH DONALD BEAN LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED
5338-24640-0007 HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NOR OF MY WRETCHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPICIONS AND HIS INFERENCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE RACKS OF THE INQUISITION
5338-24640-0008 THEY WERE HELD CONVENTICLES IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK ARMS DURING THOSE REIGNS
5338-24640-0009 SINCE THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DIMINISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES AND SEVERAL WITH A BETTER TEMPER THAN OF SEVENTEEN O SEVEN HAVE NOW TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERNMENT
5338-284437-0000 IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BEING CLEARLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE
5338-284437-0001 HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALACE OF TOURMALINE HE IS OUR QUEEN
5338-284437-0002 WHICH THAT LITTLE CABIN
5338-284437-0003 EXCLAIMED TROT OF COURSE OH
5338-284437-0004 DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALACE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN SUDDENLY SURPRISED
5338-284437-0005 THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED AN MAN IN THE CROWD
5338-284437-0006 THEY SEEM A VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY
5338-284437-0007 THE CHILDREN MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACE
5338-284437-0008 SO WE FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARNING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS
5338-284437-0009 SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAST LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY
5338-284437-0010 HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROT'S HAIR
5338-284437-0011 WHAT IS IT CORALI SHE ASKED THE WOMAN
5338-284437-0012 THE QUEEN GAZED UPON THESE FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTEREST
5338-284437-0013 SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE OF BUTTON BRIGHT'S OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAP'N BILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN TABLE
5338-284437-0014 ARE HE A GIANT
5338-284437-0015 PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDICULE ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE LATTER'S FACE CLOSELY
5338-284437-0016 THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT TO ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL
5338-284437-0017 CORALIE DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING THE QUEEN
5338-284437-0018 EVEN IN AMERICA EVERYBODY BOWS LOW TO OUR PRESIDENT AND THE BLUESKINS ARE SO FRAID O THEIR BOOLOOROO THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR THEM
5338-284437-0019 BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TOURMALINE GRANDLY
5338-284437-0020 THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUIDE THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS
5338-284437-0021 IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO SAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE
5338-284437-0022 IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DID AND HAD SERVANTS IN COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINKIES WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE
5338-284437-0023 NO OUR TIME IS BEST
5338-284437-0024 THE QUEEN HAS NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ASSIST GRIEVANCES AND TO COMPEL ORDER
5338-284437-0025 I HAVE ONE GREAT PREJUDICE
5338-284437-0026 AFTER MY DEATH A PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT AND THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKIES AND AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD
5338-284437-0027 A MISFORTUNE OF BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I DID NOT ESCAPE MY FATE
5338-284437-0028 IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FREE TO
5338-284437-0029 YES IT WAS WET AND STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SOLDIER BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AND WE GOT THROUGH ALL RIGHT
5338-284437-0030 YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE AND PINKIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY
5338-284437-0031 IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS WHO HAVE NEVER STEPPED AFOOT IN OUR LAND
5338-284437-0032 WE DO NOT HATE YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLUESKINS DO NOR ARE WE SAVAGE OR CRUEL BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU HERE AND I AM TRULY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU
5338-284437-0033 I'LL LOOK IN THE OLD BOOK FIRST
5536-43358-0000 THE SAVAGE PHILOSOPHER THE DUAL GOD
5536-43358-0001 THE ORIGINAL ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN TOWARD THE ETERNAL THE GREAT MYSTERY THAT SURROUNDS AND EMBRACES US WAS AS NOBLE AS IT WAS EXALTED
5536-43358-0002 IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE ALL SPEECH IS OF NECESSITY FEEBLE AND IMPERFECT THEREFORE THE SOULS OF MY ANCESTORS ASCEND TO GOD IN WORLDLESS ADORATION
5536-43358-0003 NONE MIGHT EXHORT OR COMFORT OR IN ANY WAY MEDDLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF ANOTHER
5536-43358-0004 AMONG US ALL MAN WERE CREATED SONS OF GOD AND STOOD ERECT AS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DIVINITY
5536-43358-0005 THAT SOLITARY COMMUNION WITH THE UNSEEN WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF OUR RELIGIOUS LIFE IS PARTLY DESCRIBED IN THE WORD BAMBIDEE LITERALLY MYSTERIOUS FEELING WHICH HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY TRANSLATED FASTING AND DREAMING
5536-43358-0006 THE FIRST BAMBREIS OR RELIGIOUS RETREAT MARKED AN EPOCH IN THE LIFE OF THE YOUTH WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF CONFIRMATION OR CONVERSION IN THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE
5536-43358-0007 KNOWING THAT GOD SETS NO VALUE UPON MATERIAL THINGS HE TOOK WITH HIM NO OFFERINGS OR SACRIFICES OTHER THAN SOME SYMBOLIC OBJECTS SUCH AS PAINTS AND TOBACCO
5536-43358-0008 AT THE SOLEMN HOUR OF SUNRISE OR SUNSET HE TOOK UP HIS POSITION OVERLOOKING THE GLORIES OF EARTH AND FACING THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THERE HE REMAINED NAKED ERECT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND FORCES OF THIS ARMYING FOR A NIGHT AND A DAY TO TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT RARELY LONGER
5536-43358-0009 WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE CAMP HE MUST REMAIN AT A DISTANCE UNTIL HE HAD AGAIN ENTERED THE VAPOR BATH AND PREPARED HIMSELF FOR AN INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOWS
5536-43358-0010 IT WAS NOT THEN WHOLLY FROM IGNORANCE OR IMPROVIDENCE THAT HE FAILED TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT TOWNS AND TO DEVELOP AN MATERIAL CIVILIZATION
5536-43358-0011 TO THE UNTUTORED SAGE THE CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION WAS THE PROLIFIC MOTHER OF ALL EVILS MODERN NO LESS THAN PHYSICAL
5536-43358-0012 IN THIS TYPE OF PRAYER THERE WAS NO BESEECHING OF WAY OR HELP
5536-43358-0013 FROM THE SUN AS AN UNIVERSAL FATHER PROCEEDS THE QUICKENING PRINCIPLE IN NATURE AND IN THE PATIENT AND FRUITFUL WOMB OF OUR MOTHER THE EARTH ARE HIDDEN EMBRYOS OF PLANTS AND MEN
5536-43358-0014 THIS IS THE MATERIAL OR PHYSICAL FIRE
5536-43358-0015 NOTHING OF THE MARVELOUS COULD ASTONISH HIM AS THAT A BEAST SHOULD SPEAK AND THE SUN STAND STILL
5536-43358-0016 I MAY CONDEMN HIS SUPERSTITION
5536-43358-0017 HERE IS THE SUPREME MYSTERY THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WORSHIP WITHOUT WHICH THERE MAY BE NO RELIGION AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS MYSTERY OUR ATTITUDE CANNOT BE VERY UNLIKE THAT OF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WHO BEHOLDS WITH AWE THE DIVINE IN ALL CREATION
5536-43358-0018 IN HIS OWN THOUGHT HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM HE SCORNED THEM EVEN AS A LOFTY SPIRIT ABSORBED IN ITS STERN TASK REJECTS THE SOFT BEDS THE LUXURIOUS FOOD THE LEISURE WORSHIPPING DALLIANCE OF THE RICH NEIGHBOUR
5536-43358-0019 THE HISTORIANS OF THE WHITE RACE ADMIT THAT THIS INDIAN WAS NEVER THE FIRST TO REPUDIATE HIS OATH
5536-43359-0000 SHE HAD NEITHER A NATIONAL ARMY NOR AN ORGANIZED CHURCH
5536-43359-0001 HER ATTITUDE AND SECRET MEDITATIONS MAY BE SUCH AS TO INSTILL INTO THE RECEPTIVE SOUL OF THE UNBORN CHILD THE LOVE OF THE GREAT MYSTERY AND A SENSE OF BROTHERHOOD WITH ALL CREATION
5536-43359-0002 THE ORDEAL IS BEST MET ALONE WHERE NO CURIOUS OR PITYING EYES EMBARRASS HER WHERE ALL NATURE SAYS TO THE SPIRIT TIS LOVE TIS LOVE THE FULFILLING OF LIFE
5536-43359-0003 THIS WILD MOTHER HAS NOT ONLY THE EXPERIENCES OF HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND THE ACCEPTED RULES OF HER PEOPLE FOR A GUIDE BUT SHE HUMBLY SEEKS TO LEARN A LESSON FROM ANTS BEES SPIDERS BEAVERS AND BADGERS
5536-43359-0004 IN DUE TIME THE FATHER TAKES OF HIS OWN ACCORD THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AND SPEAKS REVERENTLY OF THE POWERS
5536-43359-0005 INDEED THE DISTINCTIVE WORK OF BOTH GRANDPARENTS IS THAT OF ACQUAINTING THE YOUTH WITH A NATIONAL TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS
5536-43359-0006 THE COMPANION WAS NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL UNIT BUT ALSO THE UNIT OF GOVERNMENT
5536-43359-0007 THE REMOTER DEGREES OF KINSHIP WERE FULLY RECOGNISED AND THAT NOT AS A MATTER OF FORM ONLY FIRST COUSINS WERE KNOWN AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE NAME OF COUSIN CONSTITUTED A BINDING CLAIM AND A RIGID MORALITY FORBADE MARRIAGE BETWEEN COUSINS IN ANY KNOWN DEGREE OR IN OTHER WORDS THE CLAN
5536-43359-0008 WHEN SHE FELL THAT WHOLE RACE FELL WITH HER
5536-43359-0009 BEFORE THIS CALAMITY COME UPON US YOU COULD NOT FIND ANYWHERE A HAPPIER HOME THAN THAT CREATED BY THE INDIAN WOMAN
5536-43359-0010 HIS DAILY DEVOTIONS WERE MORE NECESSARY TO HIM THAN EARLY FOOD
5536-43359-0011 WHENEVER IN THE COURSE OF THE DAILY HUNT THE RED HUNTER COMES UPON A SCENE THAT IS STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL OR SUBLIME A BLACK THUNDER CLOUD WITH THE RAINBOW'S GLOWING ARCH ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN A WHITE WATERFALL IN THE HEART OF THE GREEN GORGE A VAST PRAIRIE TINGED WITH THE BLOOD RED OF THE SUNSET HE PAUSES FOR AN INSTANT IN THE ATTITUDE OF WORSHIP
5536-43359-0012 WHEN HE BECOMES AN OLD MAN HE LOVES TO MAKE A NOTABLE ATTEMPT TO PROVE HIS GRATITUDE
5536-43359-0013 HE CUTS OFF THE CHOICEST MORSEL OF HIS MEAT AND CASTS IT INTO THE FIRE THE PUREST AND MOST ETHEREAL ELEMENT
5536-43359-0014 THE HOSPITALITY OF THE WIGWAM IS ONLY LIMITED BY AN INSTITUTION OF WAR
5536-43359-0015 OUR GOD IS THE GUARANTEE FOR HIS SAFETY SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE CAMP
5536-43359-0016 LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN IS FOUNDED ON THE MATING INSTINCT THAT IS NOT FREE FROM DESIRE AND SELF SEEKING
5536-43359-0017 BUT TO HAVE A FRIEND AND TO BE TRULY UNDER ANY AND ALL TRIALS IS THE MARK OF A MAN
5536-43359-0018 HIS BOND IS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IS USUALLY FORMED IN EARLY YOUTH AND CAN ONLY BE BROKEN BY DEATH
5536-43363-0000 REINCARNATION AND THEIR CONVERSE OF SPIRITS
5536-43363-0001 THEREFORE HE COURTS DEATH IN BATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD REGARD IT AS DISGRACEABLE TO BE KILLED IN A PRIVATE QUARREL
5536-43363-0002 THE MEN BLACKEN THEIR FACES AND WIDOWS OR BEREAVED PARENTS SOMETIMES GASH THEIR ARMS AND LEGS WHEN THEY ARE COVERED WITH BLOOD
5536-43363-0003 GIVING THEMSELVES UP WHOLLY TO THEIR GRIEF THEY ARE NO LONGER CONCERNED ABOUT ANY EARTHLY POSSESSION AND OFTEN GIVE AWAY ALL THAT THEY HAVE FOR THE FIRST COMERS EVEN TO THEIR BEDS AND THEIR HOME
5536-43363-0004 IT WAS PREPARED BY DRESSING IN THE FINEST CLOTHES TOGETHER WITH SOME PERSONAL POSSESSIONS AND ORNAMENTS WRAPPED IN VARIOUS ROBES AND FINALLY IN A SECURE COVERING OF RAWHIDE
5536-43363-0005 AS A SPECIAL MARK OF RESPECT THE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN OF A WARRIOR WAS SOMETIMES LAID OUT IN STATE IN A NEW TEEPEE WITH THE USUAL HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES AND EVEN WITH A DISH OF FOOD LEFT BESIDE IT NOT THAT THEY SUPPOSED THE SPIRIT COULD USE THE IMPLEMENTS OR EAT THE FOOD BUT MERELY AS A LAST TRIBUTE
5536-43363-0006 IF A MAN WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE IT WAS AN OLD CUSTOM TO PLACE HIS BODY AGAINST A TREE OR ROCK IN THE SITTING POSITION ALWAYS FACING THE ENEMY TO INDICATE HIS UNDAUNTED DEFIANCE IN BRAVERY EVEN IN DEATH
5536-43363-0007 AT EVERY MEAL TIME A DISH OF FOOD WAS PLACED UNDER IT AND SOME PERSON OF THE SAME SEX AND AGE AS THE ONE WHO WAS GONE MUST AFTERWARD BE INVITED IN TO PARTAKE OF THE FRUIT
5536-43363-0008 AT THE END OF A YEAR FROM THE TIME OF DEATH THE NATIVES MADE A PUBLIC FEAST AND GAVE AWAY THE CLOTHING AND OTHER GIFTS WHILE THE LOCK OF HAIR WAS INTERRED WITH APPROPRIATE CEREMONIES
5536-43363-0009 IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED OCCULT POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THE LATTER DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IMPOSTORS AND ALLOWING FOR THE VANITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL ATTESTED INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE PROPHECIES AND OTHER MYSTIC PRACTICE
5536-43363-0010 NO DOUBT MANY PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN COLOURED TO SUIT THE NEW AGE AND UNQUESTIONABLY FALSE PROPHETS FAKIRS AND CONJURORS HAVE BECOME THE PESTS OF THE TRIBES DURING THAT TRANSITION PERIOD
5536-43363-0011 THESE WAS CARRIED OUT TO THE LETTER
5536-43363-0012 THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS REMARKABLE PROPHECIES AND
5536-43363-0013 ANOTHER FAMOUS MEDICINE MAN WAS BORN ON THE RUM RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND LIVES TO BE OVER A CENTURY OLD
5536-43363-0014 AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS HE SAVED HIS BAND FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL ENEMIES BY SUDDENLY GIVING WARNING RECEIVED IN A BREATH OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY
5536-43363-0015 FIVE YEARS LATER HE REPEATED THE SERVICE AND AGAIN SAVED THE PEOPLE FROM AWFUL SLAUGHTER
5536-43363-0016 THERE ARE MANY TRUSTWORTHY MEN AND MEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH TO VOUCH FOR THESE AND SIMILAR EVENTS OCCURRING AS A FORETOLD
5536-43363-0017 AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD JUST LEFT FORT ELLIS ON THE ASINUMBONNE RIVER AND MY YOUNGEST UNCLE HAD SELECTED A FINE SPOT FOR OUR NIGHT CAMP
5536-43363-0018 MANY OF THE INDIANS BELIEVED THAT ONE MAY BE BORN MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR FORMER INCARNATION
5536-43363-0019 THERE WAS A WELL KNOWN SIOUX WARRIOR PROPHET WHO LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBERED BY THE OLD MEN OF HIS BAND
5694-64025-0000 SHILOH IS
5694-64025-0001 THIS WAS THE FIRST BAD BATTLE IN WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED
5694-64025-0002 I DO NOT PRETEND TO TELL OF WHAT COMMAND DISTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEROES OF BLOOD AND WOUNDS OF SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANNON CAPTURED ETCETERA
5694-64025-0003 ABOUT DAY LIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHALMERS BRIGADE RELIEVED GLADDEN'S
5694-64025-0004 AS GLADIAN RODE BY US A COURIER RODE UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING
5694-64025-0005 ON SUNDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN OF THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
5694-64025-0006 WE WERE SUPPORTING AN ALABAMA BRIGADE TOO
5694-64025-0007 THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESSEE GIVE M HAIL COLUMBIA
5694-64025-0008 THE FACT WAS KEPT WITH THE TROOPS
5694-64025-0009 WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHENCE TROOPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY
5694-64025-0010 I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLEFIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANNON AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLE TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALISED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
5694-64025-0011 I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNINGS AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THE ORDER TO CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY
5694-64025-0012 OFFICERS COULD NOT CURB THE MEN TO KEEP ON LINE
5694-64025-0013 ON MONDAY THE TIDES WAS REVERSED
5694-64025-0014 BUT AS I SAY BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN AUTOMATON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CHRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
5694-64025-0015 SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFER YOU TO SISTER
5694-64025-0016 ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECAME FRIGHTENED GALLOPED OFF DRAGGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFEDERATE LINES
5694-64025-0017 ON MONDAY MORNING I TOO HAVE CAPTURED ME THE MULE
5694-64025-0018 HERE WAS WISE IN HIS OWN CONCEIT
5694-64025-0019 I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MULE AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS SKULL
5694-64025-0020 THE MULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND A TWISTER ON HIS NOSE
5694-64025-0021 SO HE GOT A LARGER TWO INCH ROPE TIED ONE END ROUND THE MULE'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CAISSON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHIP UP
5694-64025-0022 THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULE'S SNOW AND HE WAS FINALLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE TO CROSS THE CREEK
5694-64025-0023 ON MY TAKING THE ROPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOURE MIGHTY SMART FOLKS BUT YOU ARE A LEETLE TOO SMART
5694-64029-0000 WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON HER TRAMP AGAIN
5694-64029-0001 THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHVILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THAT WEARY
5694-64029-0002 OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MURFREESBORO AND
5694-64029-0003 FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO TO DO PICKET DUTY
5694-64029-0004 THE YANKEE PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE ON
5694-64029-0005 I AM A VIDET YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTED ON ME
5694-64029-0006 SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SECESS ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAID
5694-64029-0007 I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE REFLECTION ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
5694-64029-0008 MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET THERE
5694-64029-0009 I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED OUT MY GUN
5694-64029-0010 HE DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE HALL MISSED ITS AIM
5694-64029-0011 I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THIS OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
5694-64029-0012 WE KEPT FALLING BACKS AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
5694-64029-0013 LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF SNAKE'S RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE
5694-64029-0014 THE BAD GENERALSHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
5694-64029-0015 THE PRIVATE CAN BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
5694-64029-0016 I CALLED LIEUTENANT COLONEL RIARSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT O THERE MIGHTY QUICK
5694-64029-0017 THE YANKEES MARCHED OVER ON THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
5694-64029-0018 WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK AND
5694-64029-0019 WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILOLKERSON TURNPIKE
5694-64029-0020 WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING WE ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
5694-64029-0021 OAKLEY COLOUR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF A YANKEE LINE WITH HIS COLOURS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
5694-64029-0022 THE LEADEN HAILSTORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND PERFORMED
5694-64029-0023 WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHETHAM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
5694-64029-0024 I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND WHO WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
5694-64029-0025 I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY THROAT
5694-64029-0026 AS I WALKED BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
5694-64029-0027 I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID A GREAT GOD
5694-64029-0028 HE WAS WALKING ABOUT WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN
5694-64029-0029 THAT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES
5694-64029-0030 HE WAS STONED DEAD BUT I DROPPED THE FOOT QUICK
5694-64029-0031 BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STOPPED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
5694-64029-0032 OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTING A NIGHT ATTACK
5694-64038-0000 ADVANCE INTO TENNESSEE I
5694-64038-0001 YANK SAYS WHAT ARE YOU DOING JAWNY
5694-64038-0002 WE PASSED ACROSS ATLANTA CROSSED THE CHATTAHOOCHEE AND TRAVELLED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSON
5694-64038-0003 OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION UPON THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY
5694-64038-0004 WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAY BE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVENTY UP
5694-64038-0005 HE WALKED BACK AND SAYS HELLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS
5694-64038-0006 A YANKEE ALWAYS SAYS NAGER
5694-64038-0007 THEY PERSUADED ELOQUENTLY OH
5694-64038-0008 A MAN IN THIS WELL
5694-64038-0009 FOR THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD
5694-64038-0010 RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTRE AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IT
5694-64038-0011 BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS HER UNSOLVED PROBLEM
5694-64038-0012 THE POOR FELLOW HAS STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT
5694-64038-0013 WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND I THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR
5694-64038-0014 I DON'T THINK HIS GUN IS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE
5694-64038-0015 WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE THE TENNESSEE RIVER
5694-64038-0016 WE HAD BEEF FOR SUPPER THAT EVENING
5694-64038-0017 HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMS NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
5694-64038-0018 WE WERE INURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE AND EVERY SKIRMISH IN EVERY ADVANCE AND EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY IN EVERY DEFEAT
5694-64038-0019 HE WANTED TO GO BY HIM AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO
5694-64038-0020 BUT AFTER A WHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN I'D GANNY THE LAW
5694-64038-0021 YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE WAR
5694-64038-0022 THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW IN THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
5694-64038-0023 THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THEIR MURFREESBORO PIKE
5694-64038-0024 A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WITH JIM'S REGIMENT
5694-64038-0025 HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT FOR HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
5895-34615-0000 BUT IS LAUGHTER A SYNONYM WITH JOY
5895-34615-0001 BUT SUCH PERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATURE
5895-34615-0002 HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION OR NOT
5895-34615-0003 ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULATORS OF THE CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE
5895-34615-0004 IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELLED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MOREOVERD HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMEDITATION
5895-34615-0005 GWYNPLAINE WAS AS A MOUNTEBANK
5895-34615-0006 HE ASSURED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM
5895-34615-0007 IT WAS GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS THOUGH HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF
5895-34615-0008 OF THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIOR
5895-34615-0009 NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS PRECTUS
5895-34615-0010 ALL HIS IMPRESSIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGGRAVATED IT
5895-34615-0011 AN EVERLASTING LAMP
5895-34615-0012 THE MANICHEANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF HIS WILL
5895-34615-0013 THE WHOLE OF THIS EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT
5895-34615-0014 WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WAS EVER LASTINGLY
5895-34615-0015 THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS BUT A TRIBUTE PAID THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY
5895-34615-0016 BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENTS TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING BUT THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANAESTHESIA
5895-34615-0017 BESIDES THIS PHE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GYMNAST AND AN ATHLETE
5895-34615-0018 THE GWYNPLAINE HAD YELLOW HAIR
5895-34615-0019 HIS HAIR HAVING APPARENTLY BEEN DYED WITH SOME CORROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH
5895-34615-0020 ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MANE THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONFINE THOUGHT
5895-34615-0021 THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL HIS FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD
5895-34622-0000 ALL TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES
5895-34622-0001 IN GWYNPLAINE'S EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AS HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE
5895-34622-0002 WHAT WAS THIS REASON
5895-34622-0003 FROM SIXTEEN SIXTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
5895-34622-0004 THE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS IRON WHEELS
5895-34622-0005 THIS GREEN COLOR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN FOX
5895-34622-0006 ON THE ROOF FROM A TUBE PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SNOW AROSE
5895-34622-0007 THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS CHANGE WAS OVERWHELMING
5895-34622-0008 THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENTS OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATER
5895-34622-0009 UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT
5895-34622-0010 THE EFFECT OF HIS HEARING HAD BEEN SURPRISING
5895-34622-0011 SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSSROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF PHARISEES AND FETES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0012 A CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
5895-34622-0013 THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATER AND TO SEW SCIENCE AND ART AND THE HIGHWAYS
5895-34622-0014 BUT THESE READ PHOEBE AND VENUS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
5895-34622-0015 PHOEBE COOKED VENUS GRUB THE TOP
5895-34622-0016 AND URSUS AND HOMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0017 THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BEDCHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS IN GWYNPLAINE
5895-34622-0018 THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO EIGHT COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONED FROM EACH OTHER
5895-34622-0019 ALOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHTNING
5895-34622-0020 URSUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE TO PIECES
5895-34622-0021 THEN I LIKE PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
5895-34622-0022 THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL AT THE WORDS OF THE ITINERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR
5895-34622-0023 URSUS WAS IN EVERYTHING IN THE PEACE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN OF THE ORCHESTRA
5895-34629-0000 IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT SOUTHWARK
5895-34629-0001 THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS BUT A DELIGHT TO URSUS
5895-34629-0002 BUT SAINT PAUL IS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
5895-34629-0003 HE ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY ON THE ARTIST'S DOOR
5895-34629-0004 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BASKET
5895-34629-0005 IT WAS A THEATER THEY MADE
5895-34629-0006 AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BLOCK WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
5895-34629-0007 THE PLACARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HANGING UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN
5895-34629-0008 BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFFHAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES PHOEBE AND SOMETIMES ANOS
5895-34629-0009 WE ARE ALL IN LONDON SAID URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY
5895-34629-0010 SO THEY BEGAN THEIR PERFORMANCES
5895-34629-0011 WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTEBANK MEMORY COULD RETAIN ITS PARALLEL
5895-34629-0012 ALL SOUTHWARK RAN IN CROWDS TO ENJOY THE LAUGHING MEN
5895-34629-0013 THE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNTEBANKS OF TURINZO FIELD WERE AGHAST AT GWYNPLAINE
5895-34629-0014 GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THEIR COOK
5895-34629-0015 BECAUSE THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWARDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
5895-34629-0016 EVEN THIS COMEDIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED INTO SUCCESS
5895-34629-0017 THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED A LOCAL
5895-34629-0018 IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FROM THE NAME OF SHAKSPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
5895-34629-0019 THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE AND
5895-34629-0020 THESE WERE NOT REMARKABLE TALENTS
5895-34629-0021 BESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ALTERED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
5895-34629-0022 URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARK BUT BY NO MEANS DISPOSED
5895-34629-0023 AT EVERY PERFORMANCES THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
5895-34629-0024 THE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASE MY SUCCESS
5895-34629-0025 THIS CONNOISSEUR WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE CHARMING MAN
5895-34629-0026 HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO ACCLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOFS FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
5895-34629-0027 TO WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS
5895-34629-0028 HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO SERVE HIM
5895-34629-0029 WE HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
5895-34629-0030 ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NICLESS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM A MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
5895-34629-0031 WHAT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE HIS LORD
5895-34629-0032 HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS FUNERAL
5895-34629-0033 AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHOUTS IN DARK CORNERS
6241-61943-0000 ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP VALKLY
6241-61943-0001 BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SWEAR
6241-61943-0002 WELL I HAVE WE A FAIR WIND
6241-61943-0003 MY UNCLE WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOODY AND DISSATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE COAST OF HAMLET
6241-61943-0004 BUT NO GHOST OR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE EASTERN WALLS
6241-61943-0005 THE FACT IS THE CASTLE WAS MUCH LATER IN THE TIME OF THE HEROIC PRINCE OF DENMARK
6241-61943-0006 KNOW MISTER HARDWIGG SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
6241-61943-0007 AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET HER SOME DAY
6241-61943-0008 ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNT WOODGREL'S YOKEL WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
6241-61943-0009 THE VULKIAN KEPT OFF THE COAST STEERING TO THE WESTWARD
6241-61943-0010 ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF MALES AND SHARKS
6241-61943-0011 NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LANDING
6241-61943-0012 THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS IN THE PERIODICAL VESSEL
6241-61943-0013 THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED UPON THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US
6241-61943-0014 HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BARON TRAMP
6241-61943-0015 THE BROTHER KNEW WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
6241-61943-0016 THIS MODEST SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELANDICK AND LATIN
6241-61943-0017 WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WE AT ONCE WENT TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
6241-61943-0018 NOT HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS ON GOES WELL THE WORST DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER
6241-61943-0019 IN THE MEANTIME THIS IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE
6241-61943-0020 VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HEAD OF SAKNUSSEM
6241-61943-0021 I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO CONSULT THEM
6241-61943-0022 THEY WERE NOW NOT HOWEVER ABSENT ON DUTY
6241-61943-0023 THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE HE APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FILLED FOR CENTURIES
6241-61943-0024 I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TIES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE PASTOR AND CONGREGATION
6241-61943-0025 THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS FROM THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY
6241-61943-0026 I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DRYING SALTING AND FOLDING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
6241-61943-0027 THE MEN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MIEN EXILES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE BATTER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESQUIMAUX BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLAR CIRCLE
6241-61946-0000 I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHILARATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELLING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LITERATURE
6241-61946-0001 HANS OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE CAME FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVARYING STEP
6241-61946-0002 OUR TWO OFFICERS WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WHIP OR SPUR
6241-61946-0003 GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTHWEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VERNACULAR IS CALLED SUVEST FIJORDINGER
6241-61946-0004 WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH PORE AND SPARSE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
6241-61946-0005 THAT VERY RARELY SUCCEEDED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
6241-61946-0006 I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOKED LIKE A SIX FOOTED CENTAUR
6241-61946-0007 SNOW TEMPERATURES IMPRACTICABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
6241-61946-0008 WE MAY DO SO WAS HER REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GUIDE
6241-61946-0009 I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF THEY WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXERCISE
6241-61946-0010 YOUR ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
6241-61946-0011 HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY GURR OR ICELANDIC HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGARS ON THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE
6241-61946-0012 A FEW STRAYING COWS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
6241-61946-0013 LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNEFFELSE WHERE AGGLOMERATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS
6241-61946-0014 IT CONSISTS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT ONE IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
6241-61946-0015 I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARTA WAS TO BE FOUND
6241-61946-0016 THEIR SACRED EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM
6241-61946-0017 TO RIDE OVER SALT WATERS UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD
6241-61946-0018 IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELLIGENCE THAN THEIR
6241-61946-0019 BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO MOOD TO WAIT
6241-61946-0020 AT LENGTH THE STURDY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE HORSE'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES
6241-61946-0021 HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DANISH WORD FOR MY INSTRUMENT
6241-61946-0022 I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING A FIORD FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
6241-61946-0023 ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEEP FERRYBOATS OF THE ELB I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMOTION
6241-66616-0000 BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THEIR LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
6241-66616-0001 ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WABIGABOON'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS
6241-66616-0002 NOW THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
6241-66616-0003 A COUNTERATTACK WAS MADE UPON WOONGI AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
6241-66616-0004 THREE DAYS LATER MINNETAKI BECAME NUZEN'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
6241-66616-0005 FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FEUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREATER TRADING COMPANY A FEUD WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNTO THE SECOND GENERATION
6241-66616-0006 MEANTIME TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NUSOM AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
6241-66616-0007 THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND NEWSOME INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MINNETAQUI
6241-66616-0008 CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABI RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETAKI AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACES HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
6241-66616-0009 WABI ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN ITALIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARTHY SINEWY AND AGILE AS A LYNX AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
6241-66616-0010 ONE OF NEWSOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAS BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINNETAKI AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
6241-66616-0011 CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN POOR ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGES OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS
6241-66616-0012 THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRIGHT PUPILS AND BY THE TIME WABI WAS SIXTEEN AND MINNETAKI TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER AND SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS
6241-66616-0013 IT WAS IN ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOONGAS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS
6241-66616-0014 AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THIS OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS
6241-66616-0015 BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINNETAKI AND THEIR FORESTS
6241-66616-0016 NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WINTER HE WAS GOING TO WORK
6241-66616-0017 A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH ME
6241-66616-0018 BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WABI WENT BACK TO THE HORSE'S MOTHER TO MINNETAKI AND TO HIS FORESTS
6241-66616-0019 THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOY'S EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR AN INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
6241-66616-0020 SPRING CAME AND PASSED AND THEN SUMMERS
6241-66616-0021 WE MUST MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN IN DETROIT IN THREE YEARS
6241-66616-0022 WE WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF TWENTY DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKEN
6241-66616-0023 THREE WEEKS LATER CAME WABIGAUON'S REPLY
6241-66616-0024 ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET RODAN SPRUCEWOOD ON THE BLACK STURGEON RIVER
6241-66616-0025 THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF WABI'S LETTER FOUND ROD AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WORM THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
6295-244435-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE HOME RUNNING
6295-244435-0001 COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT REGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND SADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGENESS
6295-244435-0002 BUT THE EMOTIONS OF MARY AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE OF VICTORY ONLY
6295-244435-0003 BOATS PUT UP BOTH FROM THE FORD AND THE SHORE
6295-244435-0004 THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER THE RIVER FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS ETCHED SHARPLY IN THE DAZZLING SUNLIGHT OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY
6295-244435-0005 THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SUMTER IS HERS
6295-244435-0006 BUT THEN NEGOTIATIONS WERE SOON COMPLETED
6295-244435-0007 ALL THE AMENITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THIS CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS
6295-244435-0008 THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST WITH NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSEE AND ARKANSAS FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KENTUCKY AND MISSOURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE
6295-244435-0009 LINCOLN HAD CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION FOR HARRY HEARD EVERYWHERE IN CHARLESTON THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS NOW SECURER
6295-244435-0010 THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT DAVIS TO THE NEW CAPITOL SET IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FOE WAS TO ME ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH AND LOYALTY
6295-244435-0011 THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF GROAN
6295-244435-0012 EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD FAVOR THE SUCCESS OF THE NORTH
6295-244435-0013 AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTIONS SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERY BODY WITH IT
6295-244435-0014 BEAUREGARD AT ONCE WROTE NO ORDER
6295-244435-0015 COLONEL KENTON WRITES WISELY THAT
6295-244435-0016 WE NEED KENTUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE CAN BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE
6295-244435-0017 HARRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DELAUNAY'S WHERE SHE HAD LEFT HIS BAGGAGE
6295-244435-0018 HE WANTED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SOUGHT HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD THEM GOOD BYE
6295-244435-0019 HARRY GAVE HIS FAREWELLS WITH DEEP AND GENTLE REGRET
6295-244435-0020 WHERE THEIR MANNER WAS GRAVE OR FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN
6295-244435-0021 IT WAS A DIFFERENT HARRY WHO STARED HOME LATE IN APRIL
6295-244435-0022 FOUR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDER AND GRAVE
6295-244435-0023 HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS OR HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF THEM
6295-244435-0024 HE GAZED ON THE WORLD FULL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERILS
6295-244435-0025 BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLESTON THE GAY THE VOLATILE AND THE BEAUTIFUL WITH A REAL AFFECTION
6295-244435-0026 IT WAS ALSO BURIED NOW IN FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE
6295-244435-0027 HE WAS GOING HOME AFTER DINNER
6295-244435-0028 HE SOON HAD CHARLESTON OUT OF SIGHT
6295-244435-0029 HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE AS LONG AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATE
6295-244435-0030 PEOPLE WERE COOLER HERE AND THEY WERE SO PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION
6295-244435-0031 THE AIR TOO WAS UNLIKE THAT OF SOUTH CAROLINA THERE WAS A SHORTER TANG TO IT
6295-244435-0032 IT WHIPPED HIS BLOOD AS IT BLEW DOWN FROM ITS SLOPES AND CRESTS
6295-244435-0033 IT WAS BEFORE NOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WINTON AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STURDY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIZE STRENGTH AND AGILITY
6295-244435-0034 THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH LINES IN OLD KENTUCKY
6295-244435-0035 BILL SKELLY AND HIS GANG THEM MOUNTAINEERS ARE ON
6295-244435-0036 HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOAST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERYMAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANGRY ON HIS ACCOUNT
6295-244435-0037 AND IF YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS JUST YOU THINK ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID COLLINS
6295-244435-0038 HARRY THANKED HIM THREW HIS SADDLE BAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO HIS SYMPATHETIC LIVERYMAN RODE AWAY
6295-244435-0039 THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT HARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE NOT NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE
6295-244435-0040 BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT MOVED THEN NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED
6295-64301-0000 ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITHY WASHED HIMSELF UP WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOLIN SET OUT FOR TESTBRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA
6295-64301-0001 THAT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY AND SHE HAD CLOSED EARLY
6295-64301-0002 WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ACROSS THE FOOTPATH
6295-64301-0003 HE PRESSED HIS VIOLIN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THEY COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
6295-64301-0004 EARTH WAS GONE AND HEAVEN WAS ONLY
6295-64301-0005 BLEST AM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLESSED SHALL I BE THEN
6295-64301-0006 WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOPES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLOURS
6295-64301-0007 JUST THEN HE WAS IN A MOOD TO THINK OF THE SORROWS
6295-64301-0008 THE NETHER IN THE DOCK SAID JOSEPH
6295-64301-0009 HE WAS IN A MOOD FOR MUSIC WAS HE NOT AND
6295-64301-0010 HE LAID DOWN HIS VIOLIN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TOLD THEM IN HER FATHER'S ARMCHAIR BY THE FIRE
6295-64301-0011 LETTY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LIVING A TIRESOME VISITOR
6295-64301-0012 THEIR MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DUMB INSTRUMENTS
6295-64301-0013 BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VIOLIN WERE SURE TO THROW IN MUSIC
6295-64301-0014 THEY SAT DOWN AND GAZED IN SILENCE
6295-64301-0015 AND HER HEART SEEMED TO SWELL UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEEPING
6295-64301-0016 A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND BE SILENT TEARS FLOWED FREELY
6295-64301-0017 LETTY TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN MY MUSIC
6295-64301-0018 LET BUT A MOOD BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOUL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT FOOD AS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HAUNT THE WORLD
6295-64301-0019 IT CRIED ALOUD THAT ETERNITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET ROOMS
6295-64301-0020 NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE WOMAN TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSICIAN
6295-64301-0021 I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIPER WAS ENTREATY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF
6295-64301-0022 HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF THE PART OF A LOVE OF GOD
6295-64301-0023 WHEN THOU LOVEST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YEA OR EVEN DOG ARIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WILL NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLORIES EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE
6295-64301-0024 HE THAT LOVETH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN HOW SHALL HE LOVE GOD WHOM HE HATH NEVER SEEN
6295-64301-0025 A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BURST FROM GRAY'S BOSOM
6295-64301-0026 THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM USURPING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE AND DISPLACING IT WHEN IT FORCED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER
6295-64301-0027 HE STARTED TO CONSCIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT SHE DID
6295-64301-0028 HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOLINS WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PIANO THEN SOMEHOW STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL
6295-64301-0029 IN THE ACT OF RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT PART FROM HIS BODY WITH A TEARING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD
6295-64301-0030 HIS VIOLIN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLLY
6295-64301-0031 HIS TREASURE TAKEN TYPE OF HIS HOUSE AND A WOMAN GIVEN HIM INSTEAD
6295-64301-0032 IT'S JUST LIKE US HE MURMURED
6313-66125-0000 YOU'LL ALL BE OUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CARE

6313-66125-0013 HE TILTED HIS HEAD TO SPEAK UP
6313-66125-0014 THE MOVEMENT SENT HIS BODY SWAYING GIDILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
6313-66125-0015 CAUTIOUSLY PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCK TO STEADY HIMSELF TAD WISELY CONCLUDED THAT HEREAFTER IT DID NOT PAY TO BE TOO CURIOUS
6313-66125-0016 SLOWLY BUT STEADILY THE SLENDER LINE WAS PAID OUT AMID A TENSE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP IN THE TOP OF THE CANYON
6313-66125-0017 AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO THEM HOURS A SHARP CALL FROM THE BOATS REACHED THEIR EARS
6313-66125-0018 LIGE QUICKLY MADE FAST THE WINE TO A TREE
6313-66125-0019 I THINK HIM CALLED TAD HIS VOICE SOUNDING HOLLOW AND UNNATURAL TO THOSE ABOVE
6313-66125-0020 HE IS SO FAR TO THE BACK OF ME THAT I CAN'T REACH HIM
6313-66125-0021 LODGED ON THE BRANCHES OF A PINON TREE I THINK IT IS BUT HE DOESN'T ANSWER ME
6313-66125-0022 LIGE LEANING OVER THE BRINK WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW THE BOY'S MOVEMENTS BY THE AID OF THE THIN ARC OF LIGHT MADE BY THE TORCH ON TAD'S HAND
6313-66125-0023 BUT FROM THE CAUTIOUS MOVEMENTS OF THE LAST FAR BELOW THEM THE GUIDE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LAD WAS AT WORK CARRYING OUT HIS PART OF THE TASK OF RESCUE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY

6313-66129-0000 HE NO DOUBT WOULD BRING FOOD OF SOME KIND FOR HIM
6313-66129-0001 WITH A SHOUT THE BOYS DASHED PELL MELL TO MEET THE PACK TRAIN AND FALLING IN BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING BURROWS URGED THEM ON WITH DERISIVE SHOUTS AND SUNDRY RESOUNDING SLAPS IN THE ANIMAL'S FLANKS

6313-66129-0014 SUPPER HAVING BEEN FINISHED THE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR EVENING CHAT AFTER WHICH ADMONISHING STACY TO KEEP WITHIN HIS TENT AND NOT TO GO BORROWING TROUBLE THE BOYS TURNING IN FOR A SOUND SLEEP
6313-66129-0015 AS YET HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ATTEMPT ANY FANCY RIDING WITH THEIR PONIES OWING TO THE RUGGED NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN JOURNEYING
6313-66129-0016 THE BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO STAND WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS
6313-66129-0017 THE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE BECOMING MORE SURE FOOTING EVERY DAY AND NED SAID THAT BEFORE THE TRIP WAS FINISHED JIMMY WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK A SLACK ROPE
6313-66129-0018 AN EARLY START WAS MADE SO THAT THE PARTY REACHED THE PROMISED TABLE LANDS SHORTLY BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK IN THE FORENOON
6313-66129-0019 HER TEMPORARY CAMP WAS QUICKLY PITCHED
6313-66129-0020 THE BRIGHT GREEN FIELD SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY TALL TREES MADE THE PLACE AN IDEAL ONE FOR THEIR PURPOSE
6313-66129-0021 IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL RACE THE LITTLE INDIAN PONIES SEEMING TO ENTER THOROUGHLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CONTEST STRETCHING THEMSELVES OUT TO THEIR FULL LENGTHS AND WITH HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR BACKS FAIRLY FLEW ACROSS THE GREAT PLOD OF GREEN
6313-66129-0022 ALL AGREED THAT TAD'S SUPERIOR HORSEMANSHIP ALONE HAD WON THAT RACE FOR HIM
6313-66129-0023 GALLOPING INTO CAMP THE BOY FETCHED HIS SOMBRERO WHICH HE CARRIED WELL OUT INTO THE FIELD AND TOSSED IT AWAY
6313-66129-0024 THEN BIDDING THE BOYS RIDE ON NEAR THE SPOT TO WATCH HIM HE DREW OFF SOME TEN RODS AND WHEELING SPURRED HIS PONY TO A RUN
6313-66129-0025 GRASPING THE POMMELS WITH THE LEFT HAND HE APPEARED TO DIVE HEAD FIRST TOWARD THE GROUND
6313-66129-0026 THEY SAW HIS LONG HAIR ALMOST BRUSH THE GRASS ONE OF HIS HANDS PRESSED DOWN AND UP AND ONCE MORE TAD BUTLER ROSE STANDING IN HIS STIRRUPS UTTERING A COWBOY YELL AS HE WAVED THE SOMBRERO ON HIGH
6313-66129-0027 THAT BOYS HOWLED WITH DELIGHT THAT'S ALL DID SAVE STACY BROWN
6313-66129-0028 TEDD IS AN EXPERIENCED WRITER
6313-66129-0029 THE FIRST TIME HE RAN SWIFTLY BY IT LEANING OVER TO LOOK AT THE HAT AS HE PASSED HOLDING TO THE POMMEL FIRMLY WITH HIS LEFT HAND
6313-66129-0030 WHAT'S THAT FOR AND DEMANDED NED WONDERINGLY
6313-66129-0031 HAT TOO CLOSE TO ME I COULDN'T GET IT EXPLAINED CHUNKY THE BOYS ROARING

6313-66129-0033 ONCE MORE STACY APPROACHED HIS SOMBRERO HIS PONY RUNNING WELL AND AS HE DREW NEAR IT THEY SAW HIM RISE IN THE SADDLE JUST AS TAD BUTLER HAD DONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE
6313-66129-0034 AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE FREED HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIRRUP HE THREW HIS BODY SHARPLY TO THEIR RIGHT REACHING FOR THE HAT WITHOUT TAKING THE PRECAUTION TO GRASP THE POMMEL
6313-66129-0035 AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF STOPPING WHEN IT REACHED THE HAT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING
6313-76958-0000 CHAPTER FOUR THE FIRST NIGHT OF CAMP
6313-76958-0001 BUT EVEN IF I CAN'T SING I CAN BEAT THAT
6313-76958-0002 NOT ON THE RANGE WHY NOT DEMANDED THE FATHER
6313-76958-0003 A LOUD LAUGH FOLLOWED AT CHUNDY'S EXPENSE
6313-76958-0004 THE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LION I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AND THAT'S ALL THERE WAS TO IT
6313-76958-0005 WALTER HAD GONE OUT WITH THE SECOND GUARD AND THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED ROUND THE CAMP FIRE FOR THE NIGHTLY STORY TELLING
6313-76958-0006 NONE OF YOU WILL BE FIT FOR DUTY TO MORROWS
6313-76958-0007 YOU'VE GOT A HARD DRIVE BEFORE US AND EVERY MAN MUST BE FIT AS A FIDDLE
6313-76958-0008 OH HUMPH GRUNTED CURLY ADAMS
6313-76958-0009 THE COWBOYS DID THIS VERY THING BUT WITHIN AN HOUR HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE THE OTHERS HAVING TURNED IN ONE BY ONE
6313-76958-0010 THE LADS FOUND THAT A PAIR OF BLANKETS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THEM AND WITH AN ORDINARY WAGON SHEET DOUBLED FOR A TARPAULIN
6313-76958-0011 THESE THEY SPREAD OUT ON THE GROUND USING BOOTS WRAPPED IN FOLDS FOR PILLOWS
6313-76958-0012 STACY BROWN PROVED THE ONLY GRUMBLER IN THE LOT DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP A WEEK ON SUCH A NIGHT AS THAT
6313-76958-0013 THE HORSES OF THE OUTFIT SAVE THOSE THAT WERE ON NIGHT DUTY AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS THAT HAD DEVELOPED A HABIT OF STRAYING HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE EARLY IN THE EVENING FOR ANIMALS ON THE TRAIL OR SELDOM STAKED DOWN
6313-76958-0014 IN SPITE OF THEIR HARD COUCHES THE PONY RIDERS SLEPT SOUNDLY EVEN PROFESSOR ZEPPELIN AND HIMSELF NEVER WAKING THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH
6313-76958-0015 STACY GRUMBLED TURNED OVER AND GOT TO SLEEP AGAIN
6313-76958-0016 YOU WON'T BE SO FAST TO WORK UP HARD WORKING COWBOYS AFTER THAT I RECKON
6313-76958-0017 LUMPY BATES CAME RUNNING TOWARD HER NOT DARING TO CALL OUT FOR FEAR OF WAKING THE CAMP
6313-76958-0018 SI THERE HISSED LUMPY FILLED WITH INDIGNATION THAT ANY ONE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MOUNT A PONY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE
6313-76958-0019 STACY BROWN'S LEFT LEG SWUNG ON THE SADDLE

6313-76958-0021 KEEP A GOIN AN IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL RUN PLUMB INTO EM WAS THE JEERING ANSWER AS THE SLEEPY COWMEN SPURRED THEIR PONIES ON TOWARD CAMP MUTTERING THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF TAKING ALONG A BUNCH OF BOYS ON A CATTLE DRIVE
6313-76958-0022 ALMOST BEFORE THE ECHOES OF HIS VOICE HAD DIED AWAY A SHRILL VOICE PIPED UP FROM THE TAIL END OF THAT CHUCK WAGON
6313-76958-0023 GRUPE PILE GRUB PILE
6313-76958-0024 WHO IS THE WRANGLER THIS MORNING ASKED A FOREMAN GLANCING ABOUT AT HIS MEN
6313-76958-0025 A WRANGLER'S A WRANGLER ANSWERED BIG FOOT STODGILY

6313-76958-0028 HE'S A TRUST CURER NOT A TROUBLE MAKER EXCEPT FOR HIMSELF
6313-76958-0029 PONG TELL THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU IF YOU WAS TO SERVE BAD MEALS TO THIS OUTFIT OF COWPUNCHERS
6313-76958-0030 HOW ASKED PD
6313-76958-0031 WE'D BETTER START THE DRIVE THIS MORNING
6319-275224-0000 WHAT A FUSS IS IT MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
6319-275224-0001 YOU SURELY CAN NOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BARE STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU ON NOW
6319-275224-0002 YOUR COUSIN THE LORD CONVOLVULUS WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
6319-275224-0003 MY YOUNG PLANTS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE LOTS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIRE WORMS WHO DELIGHT TO DESTROY OUR ROOTS
6319-275224-0004 WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO LUXURIATE IN A NATURAL
6319-275224-0005 STILL THE ROSE TREE STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S WAY FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS IN THE WOODS
6319-275224-0006 THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLIC ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO A LARGE WHITE LILY INTO WHOSE REFINED EAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEM BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST THE STUPID UGLY STICK
6319-275224-0007 HE IS REALLY GRIEVED TO SEE IT
6319-275224-0008 DID THAT LOVING CREATURE SUPPOSE THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
6319-275224-0009 INDEED NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUSPICIONS
6319-275224-0010 ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY OBEYED HIS APPROACH
6319-275224-0011 MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVOLVULUS PILE TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELLED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND
6319-275224-0012 MEANWHILE HOW FARED IT WITH THE HOUSES
6319-275224-0013 OH THAT YOU WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY FIR POLE
6319-275224-0014 THE HONEYSUCKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATIONS WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELLED HER TO THE DIRT
6319-275224-0015 BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARM WORK TO LOOK ABOUT HIS PRETTY CHARGES
6319-275224-0016 BUT FOR THE NIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
6319-275224-0017 WEEDS MEANWHILE SPRING UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION REIGNED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND BRILLIANT LITTLE GARDEN
6319-275224-0018 THE MISTRESS HAD RETURNED BUT THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVOURITE GARDEN
6319-275224-0019 IN HIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
6319-275224-0020 I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GROUND MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TIE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH
6319-57405-0000 IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DEUCALION AND THAT HE WAS THE SON OF PROMETHEUS
6319-57405-0001 AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PROMETHEUS ON MOUNT CAUCASUS AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARES INTO THE WORLD WE BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
6319-57405-0002 THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY CAPTAIN ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE
6319-57405-0003 BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THEIR LAND
6319-57405-0004 NO ONE BUT AUCALION THE SON OF PROMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
6319-57405-0005 THE DAY IS COMING SAID PROMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO RESTORE MANKIND FROM THE EARTH
6319-57405-0006 BUT DEUCALION AND PIRRRA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
6319-57405-0007 HAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
6319-57405-0008 WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DEUCALION TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE
6319-57405-0009 GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MERCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MASTER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPT INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
6319-57405-0010 WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PIRKA
6319-57405-0011 SURELY I DO NOT KNOW IT SAID DEUCALION
6319-57405-0012 WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLANE THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SERVE THEM
6319-64726-0000 WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING FEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN DONE
6319-64726-0001 ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD OR UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
6319-64726-0002 THE TURN OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIERCE HER HEART WITH A SPINDLE AND DIE OF THE WOUND
6319-64726-0003 IT IS SURE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
6319-64726-0004 AND FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAT AN HONEST OLD WOMAN SPINNING FOR SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDICT
6319-64726-0005 SHE HAS NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FAINTED AWAY
6319-64726-0006 HE KNEW THAT THEY WOULD NOT AWAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
6319-64726-0007 ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WITCHES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A GREAT OGRE WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOODS
6319-64726-0008 THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FELT HIMSELF ON FIRE AND
6319-64726-0009 SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WALL WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH
6319-64726-0010 HE ENTERED A LARGE FOURCHORD AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AWE
6319-64726-0011 BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS LIKE THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT
6319-64726-0012 HE ENTERED THE GUARDROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDER BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP
6319-64726-0013 HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS ARE STANDING
6319-64726-0014 I HAVE LOOKED LONG FOR YOU
6319-64726-0015 THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND HE HAD NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY
6319-64726-0016 MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN AWAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW CLEARLY HUNGRY
6319-64726-0017 THE LADY IN WAITING BECOME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER
6319-64726-0018 THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDOR AND HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT
6319-64726-0019 THE VIOLINS AND HOBOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND ALMONER SANG THE ROYAL LOVERS IN THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE
6319-64726-0020 HE TURNS TO SHOW THEM THE CASTLE BUT BEHOLD
6345-64257-0000 WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEANIE AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THAT LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB
6345-64257-0001 AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED ALIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE AND THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BACKED AGAINST THE WALLS IT FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE
6345-64257-0002 WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BEANY UNDESIRED HAD KINDLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURALLY UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL
6345-64257-0003 SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOODS LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SWOOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAKE
6345-64257-0004 THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD RECALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING TO IT WITH A CRY
6345-64257-0005 SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOME WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND
6345-64257-0006 IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT AT WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMONG LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLORS AND ODOURS
6345-64257-0007 BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WITH EVERYTHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
6345-64257-0008 AT THIS END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TOMBS
6345-64257-0009 SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANTS SOFT FOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER OPENING ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEEDED HER
6345-64257-0010 SHE WAS LOST LOST UTTERLY WITH MY ETERNAL LOSS
6345-64257-0011 SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NO WHERE TO GO NOWHERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL
6345-64257-0012 BUT LIVING SOUL THERE COULD BE NONE TO MAKE
6345-64257-0013 SHE HAD LOST HIM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND THEN SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM
6345-64257-0014 HE CAME TO HIS SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GREETING
6345-64257-0015 I KNOW IT FOR THERE IS NO WAKING
6345-64257-0016 THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICKER DREAM AND THIS IS TRUER BECAUSE LESS SHADOWY
6345-64257-0017 HER ONLY HOPE WAS THAT SHE WAS LOST
6345-64257-0018 SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EAR OF A MIST A FUME OF MY OWN BRAIN
6345-64257-0019 THUS WAS SHE BORNE AWAY CAPTIVE OF HER BED NEITHER WILLING NOR UNWILLING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS
6345-64257-0020 WITH THAT COME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN
6345-93302-0000 SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POEM A LYRIC IN HER WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOUGHS
6345-93302-0001 HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUEBELLS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE IN MAIDENLY INNOCENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS
6345-93302-0002 YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TRYST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POEMS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEEKLY JOURNALS
6345-93302-0003 SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF HER READING FOR HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SENSE
6345-93302-0004 AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS IN ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY
6345-93302-0005 SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE PORTRAIT INSTEAD OF JANUARY AND THE DINGY DUSTY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PREOCCUPIED TRAVELLERS THE DIM DESOLATE WEATHER
6345-93302-0006 THE SETTING OF THE SCENE SEEMED TO HER MOST IMPORTANT
6345-93302-0007 IT WAS BITTERLY COLD BUT THE EMBANKMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAILWAY BRIDGE
6345-93302-0008 HE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD SOUGHT NO EXCUSE NO EXPLANATION
6345-93302-0009 BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND TALK IN ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
6345-93302-0010 THE KEEN WIND THRUSTS ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF A JACKET
6345-93302-0011 HER HANDS AND FEET WERE ACHEING WITH COLD
6345-93302-0012 SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOWN HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN AND THIS DARK HOUR
6345-93302-0013 SHE SAID HOW POWERFULLY COLD IT IS
6345-93302-0014 AND YESTERDAY I HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO LIKE TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARLING
6345-93302-0015 A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER SO THAT IS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS
6345-93302-0016 WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNOCENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS SEEMED TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY
6345-93302-0017 FINDING THE TINGLE OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP SICKENING PINCH OF JEALOUSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER
6345-93302-0018 I DON'T WONDER YOU WERE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME I WAS AN IDIOT TO BELIEVED YOU DID
6345-93302-0019 THE FOUR TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST
6345-93302-0020 COULDN'T HELP IT THEN HOW CAN I ALWAYS TRUST YOU
6345-93302-0021 DO YOU THINK I'M NOT SORRY YET
6345-93302-0022 NO IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FROM BOTH OF US
6345-93302-0023 I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO AWAY AND GLOAT OVER IT ALL
6345-93302-0024 HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY DO YOU MEAN TO
6345-93302-0025 ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OFF FOR A THING LIKE THIS
6345-93302-0026 AND HE STRODE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SWING DOOR AND WAS A VERY GOOD EXIT
6345-93302-0027 AT THE QUARTER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK AND REMEDY THAT ERROR
6345-93302-0028 AND CHECKED THE SILLY IMPULSE
6345-93302-0029 SO HE ENLISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AMERICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDALS AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLANATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
6345-93306-0000 THE LAST STRAINS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL FATED INTERMEZZO HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RUMBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDEROUS BERYL ORGAN THAT HAD SO GAYLY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TUNES OF ITS REPERTORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSEMAID AT A WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CROWING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR
6345-93306-0001 THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WAX CANDLES IN THE SOLID SILVER CANDLESTICKS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DUSK WAS FALLING AND THAT ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE MEASURE OF THE NIGHT'S APPOINTED TORTURE
6345-93306-0002 THEN THERE WAS SILENCE THAN A SIGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRAVEL
6345-93306-0003 AND AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUEER PLEASURE
6345-93306-0004 NEVER HAD SOME ACT SEEMED SO IMPOSSIBLE
6345-93306-0005 THERE IS A SEAT IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE INDEED SHE HESITATED
6345-93306-0006 THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE PORT INDICATED AND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE LAUREL BUSHES
6345-93306-0007 LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE TIRED OUT AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHY IS IT
6345-93306-0008 DO DRINK THIS AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU OUT
6345-93306-0009 YOU HURRIEDLY CUT CAKE AND PRESSED IT UPON HER
6345-93306-0010 HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURES THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM
6345-93306-0011 IS IT ONLY THAT YOU'RE POOR WHY THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TOO SHE ADDED
6345-93306-0012 HER LITTLE FOOTSTEPS TAPPED THE GRAVEL IMPATIENTLY
6345-93306-0013 HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOTEL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THEATER MY MAID A HORRID FRESH THING WE GOT IN PARIS PACKED UP ALL MY TRUNKS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PAID THE BILL AND WENT
6345-93306-0014 SHE SAID AGAIN THEN YOU ARE KIND
6345-93306-0015 WELL THEN I WENT INTO LODGINGS A WICKED WOMAN HAD LEFT ME ONE STREET SUIT AND TO DAY THEY TURNED ME OUT BECAUSE MY MONEY WAS ALL GONE
6345-93306-0016 LET ME THINK HE SAID WHY HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU HAPPENED TO COME THIS WAY
6345-93306-0017 I SHALL LOCK UP ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHOULD GIVE YOU MY LATCH KEY AND YOU CAN LET YOURSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
6345-93306-0018 I WILL CATCH THE NIGHT TRAIN AND BRING MY MOTHER ON TO MORROW THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
6345-93306-0019 YOU SEE PAPA'S SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT HIM TO TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH DUKES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED
6345-93306-0020 IT WASN'T I WHO SAID THAT SAID THE GIRL SMILING BUT THAT'S SO ANYHOW AND THEN SHE SAID
6345-93306-0021 ALL THE SAME HE ADDED IRRELEVANTLY YOU SHALL HAVE THE LATCHKEE
6345-93306-0022 YOU ARE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND OUT TO HIM HE DID NOT KISS IT AND THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY
6345-93306-0023 THE LADY AND THE GUITAR CERTAINLY PASSED THE NIGHT AT HILLVIEW VILLA BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER VERY ANGRY AND VERY FRIGHTENED CAME OUT WITH HIM AT ABOUT NOON THE HOUSE LOOKED JUST AS USUAL AND NO ONE WAS THERE BUT THE CHARWOMAN
6345-93306-0024 THE SILVER IS ALL RIGHT THANK GOODNESS SHE SAID BUT YOUR BANJO GIRL HAS TAKEN A PAIR OF YOUR SISTER'S SILK STOCKINGS AND THOSE NEW SHOES OF HERS WITH THE SILVER BUCKLES AND SHE'S GOT THESE
6345-93306-0025 IT WAS PLAIN THAT HIS CASTANET GIRL HIS MOTHER AND SISTER TOOK A PLEASURE IN CREDITING THE DAILY WITH SOME FRESH AND UNPLEASING INSTRUMENT COULD HAVE HAD NEITHER TASTE MONEY NOR HONESTY TO SUCH A POINT AS THIS

652-130726-0002 ONE OF HIS WAITERS PHIL TYSON WAS ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES TO GO BACK INTO THE BURNT DISTRICT TO BEGIN BUSINESS AND HE OPENED A RESTAURANT CALLED THE DELMANTI IN POWELL STREET NEAR MARKET BUT IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR SUCCESS AND CLOSED AFTER A SHORT CAREER
652-130726-0003 HERE AS WELL AS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES ONE CAN WELL APPRECIATE THE COLLOQUIAL DEFINITION OF CABARETI
652-130726-0004 HERE THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC AND FOOD WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED AND ALWAYS A LIVELY CROWD DURING THE LUNCHEON DINNER AND AFTER SUPPER HOURS THE ROOM IS NOT LARGE BUT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE GREATLY MAGNIFIED OWING TO THE COVERING OF MIRRORS WHICH LINE THE WALLS
652-130726-0005 THIS GARISH DISPLAY OF MIRRORS AND ELABORATE DECORATION OF CEILING AND PILLARS GIVES IT THE APPEARANCE OF THE ABODES OF SATURNALIA BUT DECORUM IS THE RULE AMONG THE PATRONS

652-130726-0015 IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS WORTH WHILE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPRIETORS DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE SPECULATIVE FEATURE AND TOO LITTLE ON THE FOOD AND HOW THEY SERVE IT

777-126732-0005 WITH HIS ELBOW PRESENTING NO APPEARANCE OF A JOINT BUT MORE LIKE A BEND AND A DUMMY'S LIMB THROWN OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR HE LEANED FORWARD SLOWLY OVER HIS SHORT AND ENORMOUS THIGHS TO SPIT INTO THE GRATE
777-126732-0006 NOW I HAD THE TIME TO THINK THINGS OUT A LITTLE HE ADDED WITHOUT EMPHASIS
777-126732-0007 WHEN HE ROSE PAINFULLY THE THRUSTING FORWARD OF A SKINNY GROPING HAND DEFORMED BY GOUTY SWELLINGS SUGGESTED THE EFFORTS OF A MORBIND MURDERER SUMMONING ALL HIS REMAINING STRENGTH FOR A LAST STAB
777-126732-0008 HIS ENUNCIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE FOR A STRANGER
777-126732-0009 THE OLD TERRORIST WENT SLOWLY HIS HEAD ON HIS SKINNY NECK FROM SIDE TO SIDE
777-126732-0010 AND I COULD NOW GET AS MANY AS THREE SUCH MEN TOGETHER
777-126732-0011 THE POSSESSORS OF PROPERTY HAD NOT ONLY TO FACE THE AWAKENED PROLETARIAT BUT THEY HAD ALSO TO FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES NAY
777-126732-0012 STRUGGLE WARFARE WAS THE CONDITION OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP IT WAS FATALLY
777-126732-0013 OH HE DID NOT DEPEND UPON EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT TO KEEP UP HIS BELIEF NO DECLAMATIONS NO ANGER NO VISIONS OF BLOOD RED FLAGS WAVING OR METAPHORICAL LURID SONS OF VENGEANCE RISING ABOVE THE HORIZON OF A DOOMED SOCIETY NOT HE
777-126732-0014 DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF I HAD NOT BEEN THE OPTIMIST I AM I COULD NOT HAVE FOUND IN FIFTEEN YEARS A MEANS TO CUT MY THROAT
777-126732-0015 A HARSH LAUGH FROM COMRADE ORSCIPIN CUT THE TIRADE DEAD SHORT IN A SUDDEN FALTERING OF THE TONGUE AND THE BEWILDERED UNSTEADINESS OF THE APOSTLE'S MILDLY EXALTED EYES
777-126732-0016 ALEXANDER OSCOPIN GOT UP TALL ON HIS THREADBARE BLUE SERGE SUIT UNDER THE LOW CEILING SHOOK OFF THE STIFFNESS OF LONG IMMOBILITY AND STROLLED AWAY INTO THE KITCHEN DOWN TWO STEPS TO LOOK OVER STEVIE'S SHOULDER
777-126732-0017 VERY CHARACTERISTIC AS PERFECTLY TYPICAL
777-126732-0018 YOU WOULD CALL THAT LAD A DEGENERATED WOULD YOU MUMBLED MISTER VERLOC
777-126732-0019 IT WAS KARL RENDT WHO WAS HEARD IMPLACABLE TO HIS LAST BREATH
777-126732-0020 LIMBROZO IS AN ASS
777-126732-0021 FOR HIM THE CRIMINAL IS THE PRISONER SIMPLES IT NOT
777-126732-0022 THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FORCE OF CONDITION IN THIS POSTURING
777-126732-0023 THE FAMOUS TERRORIST HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE LAID PERSONALLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FINGER AGAINST THE SOCIAL EDIFICE
777-126732-0024 THE SHADOW OF HIS EVIL GIFT CLUNG TO HIM THEN LIKE THE SMELL OF A DEADLY DRUG IN AN OLD VIAL OF POISON EMPTIED NOW USELESS READY TO BE THROWN AWAY UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP OF THINGS THAT HAD SERVED THEIR TIME
777-126732-0025 METALUS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE SMILED VAGUELY WITH HIS GLUED LIPS HIS PASTY MOON FACE DROOPED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MELANCHOLY ASCENT
777-126732-0026 HE HAD BEEN A PASSENGER HIMSELF
777-126732-0027 HIS OLD SKIN HAD SIZZLED UNDER THE RED HOT BRAND HE MURMURED SOFTLY
777-126732-0028 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE BEGAN DISDAINFULLY BUT STOPPED SHORT INTIMMED BY THE DEAD BLACKNESS OF THE CAVERNOUS EYES IN THE FACE TURNED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM WITH A BLIND STARE AS IF GUIDED ONLY BY THE SOUND
777-126732-0029 HE GAVE THE DISCUSSION OFF WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS
777-126732-0030 STEVIE ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DISREGARDED HAD GOT UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE CARRYING OFF HIS DRAWING TOAD WITH HIM
777-126732-0031 THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS BUT HE REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TERRORIST AS IF ROOTED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN
777-126732-0032 HIS SCARED EYES BLAZED WITH INDIGNATION IT WOULD HURT TERRIBLY HIS MOUTH GOT OPEN
777-126732-0033 COMRADE OLICIPIN'S FACE TWITCHED WITH EXASPERATION
777-126732-0034 I DON'T SAY THAT PROTESTED NICAIS GENTLY
777-126732-0035 HIS VISIONS OF TRUTH HAD GROWN SO INTENSE THAT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE VOICE FAILED TO ROUT IT THIS TIME
777-126732-0036 THE COALS IN THE GRATE SETTLED DOWN WITH A SLIGHT CRASH AND MICHAELIS THE HERMIT OF VISIONS IN THE DESERT IN A PENITENTIARY GOT UP IMPETUOUSLY
777-126732-0037 THE DISDAINFUL POUT OF COMRADE OSCIPIN'S THICK LIPS ACCENTUATED THE NEGRO TYPE OF FACE
777-126732-0038 HE PAUSED THEN HE ADDED WITH A MODEST FIRMNESS
777-126732-0039 I WOULD CALL IT CANNIBALISTIC IT'S WHAT IT IS
777-126732-0040 THEY ARE NOURISHING THEIR GREED ON THE QUIVERING FLESHS AND THE WARM BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOTHING ELSE
777-126732-0041 STEVIS SWALLOWED THE TERRIFYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUDIBLE GULP AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LIMPLY IN A SITTING POSTURE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOOR
777-126732-0042 HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRAINED VIOLENCE TURNED A KEY CAUGHT THE BOLT
777-126732-0043 HE WAS NOT SATISFIED BY HIS FRIENDS
777-126732-0044 WITH THE INSIGHT OF A KINDRED ELEMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT
777-126732-0045 THERE ARE NATURES TOO TO WHOSE SENSE OF JUSTICE THE PRICE EXACTED LOOMS UP MAGNIFICENTLY ENORMOUS ODIOUS OPPRESSIVE WORRYING HUMILIATING EXTORTIONATE INTOLERABLE THOSE ARE THE FANATICS
777-126732-0046 IN EACH CASE HE HAD NOT THE TIME
777-126732-0047 THE LOATHING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS WHO KNEW NOT MISTER VLADIMIR AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHEREAS HE HAD A WOMAN TO PROVIDE FOR
777-126732-0048 THESE WERE BUT A FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED THE SHOP HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF THEIR VALUE
777-126732-0049 THE INTERVIEW WAS UNFAVORABLE
777-126732-0050 HE TOOK THE CASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEVIE WAS STILL STANDING
777-126732-0051 HE LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW THOUGH HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION
777-126732-0052 MISTER VERLOC PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHICH TO SAY TO STEVIE
777-126732-0053 HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOORWAY AND LOOKED INTO THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE
777-126732-0054 HE WATCHED HIM GESTICULATING AND MOCKING IN THE KITCHEN
777-126732-0055 STEFI PROWLED AROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL IN A CAGE
777-126732-0056 THE LIGHT THROWN BACK BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOW SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIR DONE UP IN SEVERAL PLATES FOR THE NIGHT
777-126732-0057 HER BARE FEET AS IF POKED THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF AN UNADORNED SLEEVED CALICAL SACK BUTTONED TIGHTLY AT NECK AND WRISTS FELT OVER THE RUG FOR THE SLIPPERS WHILE SHE LOOKED UPWARD INTO HER HUSBAND'S FACE
777-126732-0058 THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT FOLLOWS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE
777-126732-0059 IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE SUDDENLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU ON THE MIDST OF AN UNINHABITED AND THIRSTY PLAIN
777-126732-0060 THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER VERLOC BECAUSE HE HAD SAT ASTRIDE VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAS NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCIPIENT FALL
777-126732-0061 THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS THE WINDOW PANE AGAINST WHICH HE IS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD
777-126732-0062 YES NOT TO ALL WELL
777-126732-0063 DOWN BELOW IN THE QUIET NARROW STREET MEASURED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEN DIED AWAY UNHURRIED AND FIRM AS IF THE PASSER BY HAD STARTED TO PACE OUT ALL ETERNITY FROM GAS LAMP TO GAS LAMP OF A NIGHT WITHOUT END AND THE DROWSY TICKING OF THE OLD CLOCK ON THE LANDING BECAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE BEDROOM
777-126732-0064 THAT POOR BOY IS IN A VERY EXACT STATE TO NIGHT SHE MURMURED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH LASTED FOR THREE TICKS OF THE CLOCK
777-126732-0065 THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT STEFI HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED
777-126732-0066 THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DOCILE THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT UPSET HIS POOR HEALTH
777-126732-0067 MISTER VERLOC'S ANXIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY INTEREST TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING
777-126732-0068 THAT BOY HEARS TOO MUCH OF WHAT IS BEING TALKED ABOUT HERE
777-126732-0069 IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WAS COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID
777-126732-0070 HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND DRINKING BLOOD WHAT'S THE GOOD O TALKING LIKE THAT
777-126732-0071 MISTER VERLOC WAS EARLY RESPONSIVE NOW
777-126732-0072 ASK KARL YUNDENT HE GROWLED SAVAGELY
777-126732-0073 HE IS N'T FIT TO HEAR WHAT'S SAID HERE HE BELIEVES IT'S ALL TRUE
777-126732-0074 HE KNOWS NO BETTER HE GETS UPON HIS PASSIONS OVER IT
777-126732-0075 HE GLARED AT ME AS IF HE COULDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS
777-126732-0076 I WISH HE HAD NEVER BEEN TO A SCHOOL MISSUS VERLOC BEGAN AGAIN BRUSQUELY
777-126732-0077 HE GETS A VERY RED FACE PORING OVER THEM
777-126732-0078 HE WOULDN'T GIVE A HALFPENNY FOR THE WHOLE LOT
777-126732-0079 THE OTHER DAY STEVIE GOT HOLD OF ONE AND THERE WAS A STORY IN IT OF A GERMAN SOLDIER OFFICER TEARING HALF OFF THE EAR OF A RECRUIT AND NOTHING WAS DONE TO HIM FOR IT THE BRUTES
777-126732-0080 AND HE CAN'T STAND A NOTION OF ANY CRUELTY
777-126732-0081 OH COMFORTABLE DEAR
7850-111771-0000 THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF HONORABLE THOMAS L HAMOUR HE WAS ADMITTED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
7850-111771-0001 AT THIS TIME GRANT WAS NOT MUCH TAKEN WITH WAR AND PROBABLY EVINCED LITTLE INTEREST IN ARMY TACTICS
7850-111771-0002 GRANT ACTED AS MUSTERING OFFICER UNTIL BEING COMMISSIONED COLONEL OF THE TWENTY FIRST ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS HE TOOK A FIELD
7850-111771-0003 GENERAL HELLECK IN SPEAKING OF THIS BATTLE SAID IT
7850-111771-0004 INDEED IF EVER A GREAT GENERAL DESERVED HONOR GRANT HAD WON IT HE HAD OPENED THE MISSISSIPPI TO NAVIGATION AND HAD CAPTURED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS AND ARMS
7850-111771-0005 HE WAS NOW COMMANDER OF ALL THE GENERAL FORCES
7850-111771-0006 THE CAPTURE OF LEE WAS A HARD MORE DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING
7850-111771-0007 TIME WORE AWAY AND ON THE NINTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE GRANT CAPTURED THE CONFEDERATE ARMY UNDER LEE THUS VIRTUALLY ENDING A WAR
7850-111771-0008 WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE SON JESSON AND A FEW FRIENDS
7850-111771-0009 HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTGROWTH OF LONG STUDY AND ABILITY TO PERFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTIVE LABOR WITHOUT FATIGUE
7850-281318-0000 SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BERDARINS
7850-281318-0001 INDEED IT IS NOT A NEST IN ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE
7850-281318-0002 AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THEM WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU
7850-281318-0003 SO WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME
7850-281318-0004 AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY ONE LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY
7850-281318-0005 SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER MAID
7850-281318-0006 SHE POPPED INTO HIS NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES
7850-281318-0007 AND SHE SAW ALL THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING OUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY
7850-281318-0008 THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US HAVE HER TO TEACH US
7850-281318-0009 SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPPING TWITTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE THE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE
7850-281318-0010 O WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE I CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NIGHT AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY
7850-281318-0011 THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENCE DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS
7850-281318-0012 AND WHERE EACH BIRD PERCHED THERE IT WENT TO BUILD ITS NEST
7850-281318-0013 SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS AND THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE
7850-281318-0014 AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STOOD NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES
7850-281318-0015 YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN
7850-281318-0016 IT CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACKDAW
7850-281318-0017 HERE WOODPIGEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLACE THOSE STICKS THROUGH AND ACROSS CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SEWING
7850-281318-0018 CRISSCROSS CRISSCROSS SOT INTERRUPTED THE WOODPIGEON
7850-281318-0019 YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO OUT AND FINISH YOUR NESTS BY YOURSELVES
7850-281318-0020 MUCH LUCK MAY SHE HAVE
7850-281318-0021 AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSY NEST IN THE ELM TREE WHERE HE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
7850-281318-0022 BUT THE WOODPIGEON WAS IN THE FIRST CASE OF THEM ALL
7850-281318-0023 FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRISS CROSS AS THE MAGPIE HAD SHOWN
7850-286674-0000 A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT IF A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBOURS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
7850-286674-0001 IT IS IT DISGRACEFUL
7850-286674-0002 THEY KNEW THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL
7850-286674-0003 THEY HAD ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS
7850-286674-0004 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS FOR EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
7850-286674-0005 THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN A BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
7850-286674-0006 BOTH LIPS ASKED HER LARVAE
7850-286674-0007 WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ARE ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH
7850-286674-0008 OUR OTHER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER
7850-286674-0009 THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWERED LIPS IN THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
7850-286674-0010 INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARMLIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS UPON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
7850-286674-0011 BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS THIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
7850-286674-0012 SCARED DAH WHO'S AFRAID HE
7850-286674-0013 HERE COMES A SNAPPY DIDLE
7850-286674-0014 SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF THAT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT
7850-286674-0015 THEY HAD THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER
7850-286674-0016 HE BEGAN TO DRAW ON HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD BLUE SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL
7850-286674-0017 THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAKE
7850-73752-0000 FERDINAND MEDITATES OVER HIS LITTLE FORTUNE
7850-73752-0001 IN MOMENTS OF DEEPLY FEELING ALIKE SUDDEN BURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE
7850-73752-0002 IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGER AND DISTRUST
7850-73752-0003 THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY OUR FRIEND FERDINAND ARMINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE TO THE GENEROUS MIRABELLE WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVERCOMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES
7850-73752-0004 FERNAND FELT HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS APPREHENSION
7850-73752-0005 IT WAS DEAD HER HANDWRITING
7850-73752-0006 RESTLESS WITH IMPENDING JOY HE SAUNTERED TO THE BRIDGES AND LEANT OVER THE BALUSTRADE GAZING ON THE WATERS IN CHARMED AND CHARMING VACANCY
7850-73752-0007 HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOW MANY FEELINGS FLITTED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE WOULD HE NOT CHEW THE CUD
7850-73752-0008 FOUR AND TWENTY YEARS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FORLORN OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE BLESSINGS OF THE WORLD SEEM SHOWERED AT HIS FEET
7850-73752-0009 THE MOST GIFTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN PROVING WHICH ATTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION
7850-73752-0010 HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE YET MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLESSINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM WERE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA
7850-73752-0011 THEN HIS CONSTANCY TO HER WAS NOW REWARDED
7850-73752-0012 AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THE COUNTRY MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO THEM
7850-73752-0013 IT WAS INDEED DANCING AS A VOLCANO
7850-73752-0014 AND NO ALL HAD ENDED SO HAPPILY
7850-73752-0015 WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATIONS WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER
7850-73752-0016 HE MIGHT BE CONTENTED BUT THAT WAS THE TALISMAN
7850-73752-0017 IN THE PRESENT UNSETTLED THOUGH HOPEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FERDINAND WOULD NOT GO LONG
7850-73752-0018 IN EXACTLY TEN MINUTES IT IS IN THE POWER OF EVERY MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FROM ALL THE TUMULTS OF THE WORLD THE PANGS OF LOVE THE THROBS OF AMBITION THE WEAR AND TEAR OF PLAY THE RECRIMINATING BOUDOIR THE CONSPIRING CLUB THE RATTLING HELL AND FIND HIMSELF IN A SUBLIME SYLVAN SOLITUDE SUPERIOR TO THE CEDARS OF LEBANON AND INFERIOR ONLY IN EXTENT TO THE CHESTNUT FORESTS OF THE ANATOLIA
7850-73752-0019 IS PAPA ALONE I INQUIRED MISS TEMPLE
7976-105575-0000 GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH A COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HARDEST FOUGHT BATTLE OF THAT CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER
7976-105575-0001 MY OWN REGIMENT WAS IN THAT ADVANCE
7976-105575-0002 FOR OUR BRIGADE WAS FEARFULLY OUTNUMBERED
7976-105575-0003 THERE WERE NO BREASTWORKS YET THAT ONE LITTLE BRIGADE OF HAMILTON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPULSED HALT AFTER ASSAULT
7976-105575-0004 NOT BALAKLAVA NOR THE ALMA SAW SUCH FIGHTING IT WAS THE DUELL TO THE DEATH
7976-105575-0005 NO BATTERY IN THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS WAR LOST SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT AN TIME
7976-105575-0006 ONE DARING REBEL WAS SHOT DOWN AND BAYONETTED CLEAN BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY B WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT
7976-105575-0007 THAT NIGHT THE ENEMY SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE GROUND
7976-105575-0008 WITH A FEW LANTERNS OUR MEN THEN WENT ABOUT AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE DEAD WERE KEPT TILL MORNING
7976-105575-0009 IT WAS NOT A QUESTION OF WHO WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHO WAS NOT
7976-105575-0010 FIFTEEN OFFICERS OF OUR TWO HALF REGIMENT WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED
7976-105575-0011 I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH A COMRADE WHO SHARED MY BLANKET WITH ME POOR OLD JIMMY KING
7976-105575-0012 HE SURVIVED THE WAR ONLY TO BE MURDERED LATER ON A PLANTATION TO MISSISSIPPI
7976-105575-0013 WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTRE LEFT WE ARE GETTING THE WORST OF IT TOO
7976-105575-0014 THAT EVENING AN ORDER CAME FOR US HAMILTON'S DIVISION TO ASSAULT THE ENEMY'S LEFT FLANK AT MIDNIGHT AND
7976-105575-0015 UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAY THE VICTORIOUS REBEL
7976-105575-0016 ONCE IN THE NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BIVOUAC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD KISHAMINGO HOTEL TO SEE A LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST
7976-105575-0017 I COULD NOT HELP MY FINGER
7976-105575-0018 GO BACK TO THE REGIMENT HE SAID SMILING ALL WILL BE GAINED
7976-105575-0019 MY FRIEND WITH MANY OTHERS I WAS BEING CARRIED OUT TO DIE ELSEWHERE
7976-105575-0020 I WALKED BACK TO THE LINES
7976-105575-0021 THE CLOUD OF RIVALS WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS
7976-105575-0022 A PERFECT BLAZE OF THE CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TOO MOWED THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS
7976-105575-0023 THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DOZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE DOORS
7976-105575-0024 THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AMONG THE UNGURIED DEAD
7976-105575-0025 INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANTS IN THOSE DAYS
7976-105575-0026 ROSECRANTZ PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN AND
7976-105575-0027 IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARDS BECOME
7976-105575-0028 FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HATCHEIG BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED
7976-105575-0029 A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RAN BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOGS WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR
7976-110124-0000 LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT WHICH HAD THREE DAUGHTERS
7976-110124-0001 EVERY DAY AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON AN ACCOUNT
7976-110124-0002 HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR MOTHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU
7976-110124-0003 WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED THIS BAND INTO A NEAR BY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
7976-110124-0004 HAVE PITY UPON A POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED UP
7976-110124-0005 LET US ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF
7976-110124-0006 THERE'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
7976-110124-0007 HE IS OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SIGHED
7976-110124-0008 IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT IS NOT FOR US TO OPPOSE IT
7976-110124-0009 BUT WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST
7976-110124-0010 HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE OTHER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BEGGAR
7976-110124-0011 IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE WE WERE EATING
7976-110124-0012 WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BEGGAR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPY POWDER OVER THEM
7976-110124-0013 THE TWO ELDEST ATE HER APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY
7976-110124-0014 SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD WHOLLY DONE ITS WORK
7976-110124-0015 THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THAT STORE
7976-110124-0016 IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAINS
7976-110124-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN OUTWIT YOU YET CRIED ANOTHER
7976-110124-0018 THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHERE IT WAS THAT HE WANTED
7976-110124-0019 I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO IT NO HARM
7976-110124-0020 YOU SHALL NOT COME IN TO MY FATHER'S HOUSES
7976-110124-0021 PASS THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE ARAB
7976-110124-0022 WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH A HOLE IN THE FLOOR
7976-110124-0023 THE CRIES AND SHOUTS OF THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR
7976-110124-0024 THEY WISHED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT DOORS
7976-110124-0025 ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISHLY
7976-110523-0000 HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GOOD FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US
7976-110523-0001 HOW CAN WE FEED HER CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES
7976-110523-0002 OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BEST PLAN THE COFFINS FOR US
7976-110523-0003 BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH OR I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN
7976-110523-0004 AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUTTING ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT
7976-110523-0005 AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY OLD CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE
7976-110523-0006 FOR IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH
7976-110523-0007 BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HAPPY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN
7976-110523-0008 EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED EM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE
7976-110523-0009 WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOODS AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN
7976-110523-0010 HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY
7976-110523-0011 COME IN AND WATCH WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE
7976-110523-0012 THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAYLAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREAD HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF A DAY
7976-110523-0013 THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HEAD AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE
7976-110523-0014 GRETEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS HE WANTED
7976-110523-0015 GRETTEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BEE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM
7976-110523-0016 DEAR GOOD GOD HELP US NO SHE PRAYED
7976-110523-0017 CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WELL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL
7976-110523-0018 SEE I COULD THEN GET IN MYSELF
7976-110523-0019 AND SHE GET UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN
7976-110523-0020 AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR WE WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES
7976-110523-0021 THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON OUR FATHER'S NECK
8297-275154-0000 NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECKE FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SYDNEY'S INTEREST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB
8297-275154-0001 THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE HIS VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER
8297-275154-0002 THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING IN THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANDAL
8297-275154-0003 RANDAL WAITED AWHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENNYDECK MIGHT PAY HER A VISIT
8297-275154-0004 HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SOIDONUM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM
8297-275154-0005 WOULD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM
8297-275154-0006 RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR HER INTERVIEW
8297-275154-0007 AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM ARTHUR
8297-275154-0008 AND YOU DISTRESS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY
8297-275154-0009 HE DRANK UP THE WINE GREEDILY
8297-275154-0010 WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE SURROUNDING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER
8297-275154-0011 HE PUT DOWN THIS EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION
8297-275154-0012 RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SYD IS
8297-275154-0013 I WILL GIVE NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER
8297-275154-0014 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THEIR ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK
8297-275154-0015 I AM ALONE D'YOU HEAR THAT ALONE
8297-275154-0016 I HAVEN'T CURSE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF
8297-275154-0017 OH WHY DID I INQUIRE THAT GOVERNESS
8297-275154-0018 I'M AFRAID HE DID
8297-275154-0019 I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT GLASS I PUT JUST NOW
8297-275154-0020 HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED EYE
8297-275154-0021 WAS THIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT
8297-275154-0022 YOU CAN'T TO DO IT
8297-275154-0023 LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS ONCE
8297-275154-0024 I THINK FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WARMLY
8297-275154-0025 SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I MAY DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE
8297-275154-0026 LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I'M NOT IN HIS WAY
8297-275154-0027 HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAK OUT OF THE FAMILY
8297-275155-0000 ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SENHAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER
8297-275155-0001 THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNEY HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDAL BOUGHT IT
8297-275155-0002 AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO A FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE
8297-275155-0003 RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN TO THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH
8297-275155-0004 WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW SHOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER
8297-275155-0005 MISSUS NORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER
8297-275155-0006 MISSUS PRESBY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL
8297-275155-0007 HOW FINE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE BEGAN
8297-275155-0008 SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM STUPIDLY
8297-275155-0009 BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SYDENHAM IN THE MATTER OF FOOD
8297-275155-0010 THE SUPPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FRIEND
8297-275155-0011 BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER A REPORT WAS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS
8297-275155-0012 AND YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT KATHERINE IS A WIDOW
8297-275155-0013 SIT DOWN SAID MISSUS PRESTING
8297-275155-0014 YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSEAL AFTER HE LEFT US
8297-275155-0015 YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WILL HAVE HAD NO MERCY ON HER
8297-275155-0016 HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS NORMAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND YOU WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM
8297-275155-0017 WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY FOLLOWED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE
8297-275155-0018 AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO DOROTHY THAT MISSUS NORMAN WAS A WIDOW
8297-275155-0019 WORSTED STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED
8297-275155-0020 BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER HER CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER
8297-275155-0021 HONESTLY ME
8297-275155-0022 AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER CHILD AGAIN
8297-275155-0023 SHE ASKED DIRECTLY WHEN HER FATHER WAS DEAD
8297-275155-0024 THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENSE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF OUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS
8297-275155-0025 RANDAL PASSED THIS THROUGH WITHOUT NOTICE
8297-275155-0026 A VERY VERY WISE DECISION SHE REMARKED
8297-275155-0027 HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BENNYDE
8297-275155-0028 NOT AT THE HOTEL NOT NOW
8297-275155-0029 IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF KATHARINE'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND
8297-275155-0030 GOOD BYE DEAR VANDAL
8297-275155-0031 ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDAL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIL
8297-275155-0032 WHEN HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN
8297-275156-0000 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED HER
8297-275156-0001 YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATTHERINE
8297-275156-0002 WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T
8297-275156-0003 NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN OF ANY ONE EDITOR CAN SUPPLY
8297-275156-0004 SURPRISING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE
8297-275156-0005 IN THE MEAN TIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN THE FATHER AND CHILD
8297-275156-0006 HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT LIDNEY AN INTERVIEW
8297-275156-0007 EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO ZYDENHAM
8297-275156-0008 AND BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW
8297-275156-0009 CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIENDS
8297-275156-0010 WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME THIS FRIEND'S WIFE
8297-275156-0011 CAN I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW
8297-275156-0012 HE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS ON A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING
8297-275156-0013 BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THEIR MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERINE'S REPLY
84-121123-0000 GO GO YOU HEAR
84-121123-0001 BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH AN OBSTINATE WEIGHT
84-121123-0002 AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTRED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS IF HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY
84-121123-0003 AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTENED IN ITS SILENCE
84-121123-0004 D'VERNY RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE
84-121123-0005 D'AVERIGNY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN
84-121123-0006 FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS OR PRAYERS
84-121123-0007 WHAT' DO YOU MEAN SIR
84-121123-0008 OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO ESCAPE THE NETS IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVE
84-121123-0009 DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASK MORREL
84-121123-0010 NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON M MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION
84-121123-0011 SAID MORREL SADLY YES I REPLIED NOIRTIER
84-121123-0012 THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED ON THE LETTER
84-121123-0013 ASKED MORRET YES
84-121123-0014 WILL I LEAVE ALONE NO
84-121123-0015 BUT CAN IT UNDERSTAND YOU YES
84-121123-0016 GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOUR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOREVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST YOURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK
84-121123-0017 MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THIS SECRET DO YOU NOT FEAR
84-121123-0018 MORREL THRUST AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM
84-121123-0019 THE OLD MAN MADE A SIGN IN A AFFIRMATIVE
84-121123-0020 IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF NOIRTIER WHO WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS
84-121123-0021 BUT WE STOPPED ON THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER
84-121123-0022 THE TWO FATHERS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE
84-121123-0023 NOIRTIER WAS NEAR THEIR BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE
84-121123-0024 A DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JUST UNCLOSED THE LIPS
84-121123-0025 THE NEAREST SAID THE DISTRICT DOCTOR IS A GOOD ITALIAN ABBE WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU SHALL I CALL ON THEM AS I PASS
84-121123-0026 D'AUBIGNY SAID VILLEFORT BE SO KIND I BESEECH YOU AS TO ACCOMPANY THIS GENTLEMAN HERE IS THE KEY OF THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND OUT AS YOU PLEASE YOU WILL BRING THE PRIEST WITH YOU AND WILL OBLIGE ME BY INTRODUCING HIM INTO MY CHILD'S ROOM DO YOU WISH TO SEE HIM
84-121123-0027 I ONLY WISH TO BE ALONE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME YOU NOT
84-121123-0028 I AM GOING NOW AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PRAYERS WILL BE MORE FERVENT THAN MINE
84-121550-0000 BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHYME
84-121550-0001 ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LIMPID ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEALS
84-121550-0002 THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND HOW PROSERPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
84-121550-0003 I DO NOT THINK THERE SHONE SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHILE TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM
84-121550-0004 YE ARE NEW COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE PERADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR HER NEST
84-121550-0005 SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELLING BUT THE PSALM DELECTAE GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOUD YOUR INTELLECT
84-121550-0006 THE GOOD SUPREME SOUL IN ITS SELF DELIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANSEL OF ETERNAL PEACE
84-121550-0007 BY ITS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SOJOURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY
84-121550-0008 THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL IT TO THEE NO MORE
84-121550-0009 BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED THEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
84-121550-0010 NOR EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF INTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
84-121550-0011 NOW HELIAUN MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR URANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK
84-121550-0012 THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCED BY NUMEROUS WEDDED BRIDES
84-121550-0013 AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARDS GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DELIA'S GIRDLE
84-121550-0014 THESE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WITH THE OUTERMOST APART
84-121550-0015 THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE THREE CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
84-121550-0016 NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR E'ER GLADDENED HYRCANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN BE
84-121550-0017 THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT ON THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED
84-121550-0018 THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY BORN
84-121550-0019 IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE THIRTY OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GAIT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
84-121550-0020 AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESSED INTERDICTED
84-121550-0021 AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VENI SPONSA DELBANO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER
84-121550-0022 AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE SOUL SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH ERE FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH
84-121550-0023 TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THIS LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED
84-121550-0024 TO SAY UNTO VIRGILIUS NOT A DRACHAM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
84-121550-0025 DANTES BECAUSE VIRGILIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET A WHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SORT THOU NEEDST MUST WEEP
84-121550-0026 I SAW THE LADY WHO EREWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER ARMS TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
84-121550-0027 LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH I'M BEATRICES
84-121550-0028 YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MADE UPON THEIR PATH
84-121550-0029 THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY SEE ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOLE BE OF ONE MEASURE
84-121550-0030 BUT OF THE LARGENESS OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR REIGN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT
84-121550-0031 AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHER
84-121550-0032 SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALREADY SHORT SAVE THE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PERDITION
84-121550-0033 CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THAT
84-121550-0034 THUS SHE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO
84-121550-0035 AND WHAT ALLUREMENTS AND WHAT VANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHER SHOWED THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM
8842-302196-0000 HE TRANSLATED AT AN EARLY AGE CHIEFLY BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE AND EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE A GREAT NUMBER OF POEMS BY THE ITALIAN'S CONTEMPORARY WITH DANTES OR PRECEDING HIM AND AMONG OTHER THINGS HE MADE A VERSION OF THE WHOLE VITANOAVA PROSE AND VERSE
8842-302196-0001 THIS BOOK IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOUR AND SETTLED THE CLAIM OF ROSSETTI TO RANK AS A POETIC TRANSLATOR OR INDEED AS A POET IN HIS OWN RIGHTS
8842-302196-0002 THE LIFEBLOOD OF RHYTHMICAL TRANSLATION IS THIS COMMANDMENT THAT A GOOD POEM WILL NOT BE TURNED INTO A BAD ONE
8842-302196-0003 THE ONLY TRUE MOTIVE IN PUTTING POETRY INTO A FRESH LANGUAGE MUST BE TO ENDOW A FRESH NATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITH ONE MORE POSSESSION OF BEAUTY
8842-302196-0004 POETRY NOT BEING AN EXACT SCIENCE LITERALITY OF RENDERING IS ONLY SECONDARY TO THIS CHIEF LAW
8842-302196-0005 OFTEN WOULD HE AVAIL HIMSELF OF ANY SPECIAL GRACE OF HIS OWN IDIOM AND EPOCH IF ONLY HIS WILL BELONGED TO HIM OFTEN WOULD SOME CADENCE SERVE HIM BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S PLEASURE SOME STRUCTURE BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S CADENCE OFTEN THE BEAUTIFUL TURN OF HIS STANZA MUST BE WEAKENED TO ADAPT SOME RHYME WHICH WILL TALLY AND HE SEES THE POET REVELLING IN ABUNDANCE OF LANGUAGE WHERE HIMSELF IS SCANTILY SUPPLIED
8842-302196-0006 BUT IF YOU HAVE TIME IT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE TO TRANSLATE THE ANALYSIS OF THE POEM WHICH I OMITTED
8842-302196-0007 ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH HE WROTE MANY AND MANY THANKS FOR A MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICE MOST FAIRLY PERFORMED
8842-302196-0008 MY NOTES WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE OF REVISING ARE OF COURSE QUITE A PALTRY AND USELESS
8842-302196-0009 IT IS THEREFORE AND ON ALL ACCOUNTS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MUCH MORE OF THEIR WORK HERE THAN IT SAYS FOR ITSELF
8842-302196-0010 THROUGHOUT THE VITA LUAVA THERE IS A STRAIN LIKE THE FIRST FALLING MURMUR WHICH REACHES THE EAR IN SOME REMOTE MEADOW AND PREPARES US TO LOOK UPON THE SEA
8842-302196-0011 A WORD SHOULD BE SAID HERE OF THE TITLE OF DANTE'S AUTO BIOGRAPHY
8842-302196-0012 THIS HAS INDUCED SOME EDITORS OF THE VITA NUIA TO EXPLAIN THE TITLE AS MEANING EARLY LIFE
8842-302201-0000 THEREAFTER THIS SONNET BRED IN ME DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN IN VERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THOSE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST
8842-302201-0001 WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DIVERSE TIMES AT MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY
8842-302201-0002 BUT WHEN I STILL SPAKE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO THAT END LOVEST THOU THIS LADY SEEING THAT THOU CANST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE
8842-302201-0003 AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL MY BEATITUDE THERE WHERE MY HOPE WILL NOT AVAIL ME
8842-302201-0004 THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOW FALL AMONG THE RAIN SO WAS THEIR TALK MINGLED WITH SORROWS
8842-302201-0005 AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE SHEDS SUCH PERFECT SWEETNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAILED NOT SCARCELY TO HIM MY LISTENERS MUST BE ALL RESIGNED
8842-302201-0006 WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE DO ISSUE THENCE IN FLAME WHICH THROUGH THEIR EYES WHO THEN MIGHT LOOK ON THEM PIERCE TO THE HEART'S DEEP CHAMBER EVERY ONE
8842-302201-0007 TO HER I WEND AWAY IN WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS IS MADE STRONG
8842-302201-0008 SO TO THE GROUND THOU SHALT BE RECONCILED AND FIND THE LADY AND WITH THE LADY LOVE
8842-302201-0009 THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AN ANGEL THE THIRD HERE IN SONG I KNOW
8842-302201-0010 THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTO FOURTEEN
8842-302201-0011 IN THE FIRST I SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPEDED BY FAINT HEARTEDNESS
8842-302201-0012 IN THE FOURTH REPEATING TO WHOM I PURPOSES SPEAKING I TELL THE REASON WHY I SPEAK TO THEM
8842-302201-0013 IN THE SECOND I TELL YOU WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER ON EARTH HERE MY LADY IS DESIRED
8842-302201-0014 THE SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE FIRST I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER SOUL RELATING SOME OF HER VIRTUES PROCEEDING FROM HER SOUL IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER BODY NARRATING SOME OF HER BEAUTIES HERE LOVE SAITH CONCERNING HER I
8842-302201-0015 THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE ONE I SPEAK OF THE EYES WHICH ARE THE BEGINNING OF LOVE IN THE SECOND I THINK OF THE MOUTH WHICH IS THE END OF LOVE
8842-302203-0000 AND AT THE FIRST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SAW CERTAIN FACES OF WOMAN WITH THEIR HAIR LOOSENED WHICH CALLED OUT TO ME THOU SHALT SURELY DIE AFTER THE WHICH OTHER TERRIBLE AND UNKNOWN APPEARANCES SAID UNTO ME THOU ART DEAD
8842-302203-0001 AND SO STRONG WAS MY FANTASY THAT I WEPT AGAIN IN VERY TRUTH AND SAID WITH MY TRUE VOICE O EXCELLENT SOUL HOW BLESSED IS HE WHO NOW LOOKETH UPON THEE
8842-302203-0002 WHEREBY TWO LADIES WHO WERE ABOUT THE ROOM BECOMING AWARE OF MY DISCOMFORT BY REASON OF THE MOAN THAT SHE MADE WHO INDEED WAS OF MY VERY NEAR KINDRED LED HER AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS AND THEN SET THEMSELVES TO AWAKEN ME THINKING THAT I DREAMED AND SAYING SLEEP NO LONGER AND BE NOT DISQUIETED
8842-302203-0003 WITH BEING AROUSED I OPENED MINE EYES AND KNEW THAT IT HAD BEEN A DECEPTION
8842-302203-0004 AND MY HUE WAS SUCH THAT THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THOUGHT OF DEATH SAYING UNDER THEIR BREATH MOST TENDERLY O LET US COMFORT HIM THAT UNTO ME WHAT DREAM WAS THINE THAT IT HATH SHAKEN THEE SO MUCH
8842-302203-0005 AND THEREWITHAL SUCH A BEWILDERMENT POSSESSED ME THAT I SHUT MINE EYES FOR PEACE AND IN MY BRAIN DID CEASE ORDER OF THOUGHT AND EVERY THING
8842-302203-0006 THEN SAW I MANY BROKEN HINTED SIGHTS AND THAT UNCERTAIN STATE I STEPPED INTO
8842-302203-0007 THESE WELDERING FANTASIES THEN CARRIED ME TO SEE MY LADY DEAD
8842-302203-0008 THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE I WAS AS THINKING THE FIRST PART DIVIDES INTO TWO
8842-302203-0009 THIS LADY'S RIGHT NAME WAS JOAN BUT BECAUSE OF HER COMELINESS OR AT LEAST IT WAS SO IMAGINED SHE WAS TOLD OF MANY PRIMA VERA SPRING AND WENT BY THAT NAME AMONG THEM
8842-302203-0010 AND IN HIS SPEECH HE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AGAIN THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE TO REMAIN I CHANCED TO LOOK THAT WAY HE HAD DRAWN NEAR AND SAW THE LADIES JOAN AND BEATRICE APPROACH ME THIS THE OTHER FOLLOWING ONE AND A SECOND MARVEL INSTANTLY
8842-302203-0011 THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE SAYING BINU THE THIRD HERE THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE
8842-304647-0000 HE LIVED THY LOSS HE DIES FROM EVERY LIMB MANGLED BY THEE LIGHTNINGS OF GODHEAD SHINE FROM WHICH THY DARKNESS HATH NOT WHERE TO HIDE
8842-304647-0001 QUINCIAM PARA STUPERTI
8842-304647-0002 AND FLESH WAS RAIMENTED HOW HE WAS KILLED AND BURIED FROM THE DEAD HOW HE ROSE TO LIFE WITH VICTORY AND REIGNED IN HEAVEN HOW ALL OF US SHALL BE GLORIOUS LIKE HIM WHOSE HEARTS TO HIS ARE WED HOW THEY WHO DIE FOR LOVE OF REASON GIVE HYPOCRITES TYRANTS SOPHISTS ALL WHO SELL THEIR NEIGHBORS ILL FOR HOLINESS TO HELL HOW THE DEAD SAINT CONDEMNS THE BAD WHO LIVE HOW ALL HE DOES BECOMES A LAW FOR MEN HOW HE AT LAST TO JUDGE SHALL COME AGAIN
8842-304647-0003 THIS WORLD'S THICK VAPOURS WHELM YOUR EYES UNWORTHY OF THIS GLORIOUS SHOW BLIND TO HIS SPLENDOUR BENT UPON HIS SHAME
8842-304647-0004 MONEY IS FALSE AND LIGHT UNLESS IT BE BOUGHT BY A MAN'S OWN UNWORTHY QUALITIES AND BLOOD IS SUCH THAT ITS CORRUPT DISEASE AND IGNORANT PRETENSE ARE FOUL TO SEE
8842-304647-0005 OVER POPOLO UNABESTIA
8842-304647-0006 THE PEOPLE IS A BEAST OF MUDDY BRAIN THAT KNOWS NOT ITS OWN FORCE AND THEREFORE STANDS LOADED WITH WOOD AND STONE THE POWERLESS HANDS OF A MERE CHILD GUIDE IT WITH BIT AND REIN ONE KISS WOULD BE ENOUGH TO BREAK THE CHAIN BUT THE BEAST FEARS AND WHAT THE CHILD DEMANDS IT DOES NOR ITS OWN TERROR UNDERSTANDS CONFUSED AND STUPEFIED BY BUGBEAR'S VEIN
8842-304647-0007 MOST USEFUL
8842-304647-0008 THAT PENANCE HATH NO BLAME WHICH MAGDALEN FOUND SWEET PURGING ALL SHAME SELF PUNISHMENT IS VIRTUE ALL MEN KNOW
8842-304647-0009 THE ORGAN OF RUT NOT REASON IS THE LORD WHO FROM THE BODY POLITIC DOTH DRAIN LUST FOR HIMSELF INSTEAD OF TOIL AND PAIN LEAVING US LENA'S CRICKETS ON DRY SWARD
8842-304647-0010 WELL TOO IF HE LIKE LOVE WOULD FILCH OUR HOARD WITH PLEASURE TO OURSELVES SLUICING OUR VEIN AND VIGOUR TO PERPETUATE THE STRAIN OF A LIFE BY SPILTH OF LIFE WITHIN US STORED
8842-304647-0011 HEAVEN HELP THAT BODY WHICH A LITTLE MIND HOUSED OF A HEAD LACKING EARS TONGUE AND EYES AND SENSELESS BUT FOR SMELL CAN TYRANNIZE
8842-304647-0012 DO TO THEE THEIR PRAISE OF WOMEN PURE OF TEEMING MOTHERHOOD
8842-304647-0013 THOU LIKE ARCOURUS STEADFAST IN THE SKIES WITH TARDY SENSE GUIDEST THY KINGDOM FAIR BEARING ALONE THE LOAD OF LIBERTY
