NARROW BOARD WALKS EXTENDED ON PASSING HERE A HOUSE AND THERE A STORE AT FAR INTERVALS EVENTUALLY ENDING ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE	(2277-149874-2277-149874-0019)
IT GAVE AN IMPOSING APPEARANCE TO MOST OF THE WHOLESALE HOUSES WHOSE OFFICES WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR AND IN PLAIN VIEW ON THE STREET	(2277-149874-2277-149874-0020)
THESE VAST BUILDINGS WHAT WERE THEY THEY	(2277-149874-2277-149874-0021)
HE WAS IN A FEVERED STATE OF MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFE'S ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON THIS ENTIRE FUTURE	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0000)
HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY HER THE MONEY WHICH SHE WOULD NOW REGULARLY DEMAND OR THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HE SAID	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0001)
HURSTWOOD WALKED THE FLOOR MENTALLY ARRANGING THE CHIEF COINS OF HIS SITUATION	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0002)
WE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0003)
HOW WOULD THE PAPERS SPEAK ABOUT IT	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0004)
MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BOW MOISTENED	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0005)
HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR CAREY WOULD BE GLAD TO WRITE IF NECESSARY	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0006)
HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO EAT AS USUAL	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0007)
FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANNED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICE	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0008)
WHILE THE DANGER WAS NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALISED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0009)
SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DHURA THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0010)
HE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RUMINATED AND THEY DECIDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0011)
SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET OVER THIS MORNING	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0012)
HE WILL GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0013)
AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP LOOKING AND DREARILY HEADED FOR THE MADISON CAR	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0014)
WE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CARRIE	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0015)
FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOTHING FROM YOUR WIFE EITHER	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0016)
AT ONE THIRTY THEY WENT TO RECTOR'S FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0017)
HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOUR WORDS IN REPLY GET TO THE DEVIL	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0018)
BUT HE COMPROMISED BY TELLING THE FATHER THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0019)
THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT OF ITS WORK	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0020)
WHAT WOULD SHE DO AT THAT THE CONFOUNDED WRETCH	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0021)
LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISRETION ASSERTED ITSELF	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0022)
SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CLIMAX WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NEVER SIT IDLE	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0023)
YOU KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDED UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0024)
HE AROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND TURNED AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0025)
THE LONG DRIZZLE HAD BEGUN PEDESTRIANS HAD TURNED ON COLLARS AND TROUSERS AT THE BOTTOM	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0026)

HE PUT DOWN HIS HAT AND LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS UMBRELLA	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0028)
I WOULD HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF THIS THING	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0029)
HE BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY PERHAPS HE COULD DO IT UP HERE	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0030)
HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANYBODY HE WOULD HAVE NO ROW	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0031)
BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER AND ABOVE THAT SOME SOLUTION WOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0032)
THEN HE RANG THIS BELL NO ANSWER	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0033)
HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL NOR ANSWER	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0034)
WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATEST QUANDARY THAN EVER	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0000)
HE CAN HARDLY REALISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0001)
NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND BUT YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0002)
HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED ANY PLAN UPON THAT SCORE	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0003)
HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PANACEA FOR THE ILL WHICH POSSESSED HIM	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0004)

IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK SHE WOULDN'T SEND IT	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0012)
FOR RELIEF HE AROSE AND JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION WITH A FEW PERSONS WHO WERE DRINKING	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0013)

HE DECIDED TO TAKE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0018)

IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FEELING TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0024)
HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE HAD MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED AT HIS PERFIDY	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0025)

HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STOOD OR HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0028)

HE WOULD NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0030)
HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY TO RICHARD	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0031)
HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCHMAN ON HIS RETURN PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0032)
ON WEDNESDAY I RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMES AND HAY IT READ	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0033)

THE PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0000)
THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY TERRIBLE ONE	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0001)
ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST DEVISES TO THE PRINTER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0002)
THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN HEARING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0003)
I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO ANY ABSURDITY	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0004)
I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK ON WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0005)
BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT IN WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFELONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0006)
I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH YOU HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0007)

I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TROBNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0010)
I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVORABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0011)

I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EREWHON THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I SHOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0015)
THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPYRIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRED IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0016)
IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0000)

I WOULD TRY THE NEARER RANGES AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0015)
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0000)
MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOT EYE THEM	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0001)
THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY GREEN	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0002)
THE VINE GREW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND HERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0003)
EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF SHOPLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGETATED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN HEIR MERCANTILE AND THE BLEAKEST	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0004)
EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYES LASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0005)
THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION AND FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR FROM EARTHLY	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0006)
EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMELY AND THE OLD GRAY HEADED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0007)
THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN ESPECIALLY	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0008)
I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST AND EGYPTIAN GREEK AND ITALIAN	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0009)
THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY IT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0010)
I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY COMRADES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0011)
THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING FLANKED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0012)
I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NUMBERS AND ENORMOUS TAILS	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0013)
IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES I CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0014)
SUFFICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATES AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0015)

THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELLOUSLY SELF CONTAINING AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0017)

BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HELD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0019)
AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR IRON TRAILS	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0020)
WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHERS	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0021)
THE DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT A THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0022)

BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNEWINGS	(2428-83705-2428-83705-0001)

NO WORD AND NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0039)
IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOWL FROM HEAVEN	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0040)

BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY SITUATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0003)

AND WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER INTO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0017)
THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT THAT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0018)

THINKING I HAD THE RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM ANY CARE HE REQUIRED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0024)
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0025)
HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0026)
THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED THEREO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0027)
DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT ONE LAY DOWN AGAIN	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0028)
HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL HIM THE NEWS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0029)
WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS SHALL SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0030)
UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMERAL CALCULUS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO MANY QUESTIONS I LIKED TO PUT	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0031)

THE THREE CHILDREN WERE ASTOUNDED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0033)

IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0036)
THEN ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULUS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0037)
NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH THOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANY ONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0038)
THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS BUT THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0039)
BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL BUT IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0040)
THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN WHOLE DEVOTEES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0041)
AS FOR THE EUCHARIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT JESUIT	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0042)

BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF A SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENON THEY MET WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELLECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0044)

CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABI RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETAKI AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFTLY JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD	(6241-66616-6241-66616-0008)
WABI ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARTHY SINEWY AND AGILE AS A LYNX AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WATER	(6241-66616-6241-66616-0009)
ONE OF NEWSOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINNETAKI AND HER BROTHER BE MIRRORED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN	(6241-66616-6241-66616-0010)
CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN BRIGHT ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS	(6241-66616-6241-66616-0011)

IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOONDAS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS	(6241-66616-6241-66616-0013)
AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEADS AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS	(6241-66616-6241-66616-0014)
WITH EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINNETAKI AND HIS FORESTS	(6241-66616-6241-66616-0015)
NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS CALLED TO WORK	(6241-66616-6241-66616-0016)
A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE LOVER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM	(6241-66616-6241-66616-0017)
BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WABI WENT BACK TO HIS PRINCESS'S MOTHER TO MINNETAKI AND TO HIS FORESTS	(6241-66616-6241-66616-0018)
THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOY'S EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE FATHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE	(6241-66616-6241-66616-0019)

THE CLOUD OF REBELS WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO SEVERAL COLUMNS	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0021)
A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TO MOWED THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0022)
THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DOZENS ONE CLOSE UP TO THE WORKS	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0023)
THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON A BATTLE FIELD AMONG THE UNBURIED DEAD	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0024)
INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT IN SOME DAYS	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0025)
AND ROSECRANTZ PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0026)
IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE HOUR WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0027)
FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HATCHEIL BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0028)
A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOGS WERE EATING UP THE HOUSES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0029)
LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT WHO HAD THREE FATHERS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0000)
EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON ITS ACCOUNT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0001)
NOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0002)
WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BAND INTO A NEAR BY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSES HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0003)
HAVE PITY ON THE POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED OUT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0004)
LET ME ENTER TO PRAY YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0005)
IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES IN THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0006)
HE HAS OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0007)
IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT IS NOT FOR ME TO OPPOSE IT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0008)
BUT WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO MY FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0009)
HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BEGGARS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0010)
IT IS A FEARFUL DAY TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0011)
WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BEGGAR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER ON THEM	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0012)
THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT THEY THREW THE APPLE AWAY	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0013)
SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD LITERALLY DONE ITS WORK	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0014)
THEN SHE HEARD HIM GOING DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0015)
IT WAS MY YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0016)
PERHAPS WE CAN OUTWIT HER YET CRIED OTHER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0017)

I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO YOU NO HARM AND	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0019)
YOU CAN NOT COME IN TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0020)
PASS THE CHARM OFF TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0021)
WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HOLE IN HER DOOR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0022)
THE CRIES AND BURSTS OF THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0023)
THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT STORES	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0024)
I ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0025)
HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BED AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0000)
HOW CAN THEY FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0001)
OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLANN THE COFFINS FOR US	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0002)
BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT WE SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0003)
AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOORS WENT OUT	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0004)
AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF HER HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0005)
BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS BASKET UPON THE PATH	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0006)
BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE HIS LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0007)
EARLY IN THE MORNING HER STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0008)
YOU ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0009)
HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREEN PIECE WHILE GRETEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0010)
COME IN AND STOP WITH ME BUT NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0011)
THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAYLAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREAD HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF DAY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0012)
THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY HE WAS OF NO USE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0013)
GRETEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE LIKED	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0014)
GRETTEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I'LL KILL AND COOK HIM	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0015)

CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETEL GOT IN TO SET UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0017)

AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HAT INTO THE OVEN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0019)
AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WIDOW'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0020)
WHEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0021)
NOT HAVING HEARD FROM MADAME BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SYDNEY'S INTEREST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0000)
THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSELS BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0001)
THIS ALTERNATIVES IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANDAL	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0002)

AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERTS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0007)
YOU DISTRESS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS SAY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0008)
HE RANG THE WINE GREEDILY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0009)
WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT HAD MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0010)
HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0011)
RANDAL HE SAID AND YOU KNOW WHERE SYDNEY IS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0012)
THEY WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0013)

I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING A GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0019)
HE STOPPED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0020)
WAS HIS MIND DRAWING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0021)

THE NEW NOTE OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDAL BOUGHT IT	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0001)
AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT IN THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0002)
RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS AND THE PARAGRAPH	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0003)
WITH HIS OWN SUSPICION STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE THE STRANGER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0004)
MISSUS NORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GREAT TIME FOR DINNER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0005)

THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FELLOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0010)
BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER THAT REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0011)

SIT DOWN THERE SAID MISSUS PRESTY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0013)
YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSEAL AFTER THEY LEFT US	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0014)

HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS NORMAN'S LITTLE GIRL BUT WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0016)
WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER THEY NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0017)
AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO PETER THAT MISSUS NORMAN WAS A WIDOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0018)
WORST STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PLANTED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0019)
BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE GIRL'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0020)
HE HONESTLY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0021)
AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER DAUGHTER AGAIN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0022)
SHE ASKED EXACTLY IF HER FATHER WAS DEAD	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0023)
THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY MY DEFENCE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0024)
RANDAL PASSED THIS BY WITHOUT NOTICE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0025)
A VERY WISE DECISION SHE SMILED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0026)
I HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BENNYDECK	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0027)
NOT AT THE HOTEL JUST HERE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0028)
IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON AFTER HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0029)
A GOOD BYE DEAR RANDAL	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0030)
ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDOR FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0031)
WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN TO LONDON CAME IN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0032)

AND SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0004)
IN THE MEAN TIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOODS WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0005)
HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT CYDNEY AN INTERVIEW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0006)
EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SIDDENHAM	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0007)
BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN TRUTH BEFORE HIM NOW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0008)
CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEM TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH THE INTIMATE FRIEND	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0009)
WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS SOLID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0010)
SHALL I SAY THAT I MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0011)
HE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED THE LETTER THAT EVENING	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0012)
BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED UPON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHARINE'S REPLY	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0013)
GO DO YOU FEAR	(84-121123-84-121123-0000)
BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WASTE	(84-121123-84-121123-0001)
AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTERED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE IT BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY	(84-121123-84-121123-0002)
AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM THE PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE	(84-121123-84-121123-0003)
DEVERIGNY RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0004)
DAVERIE UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARD THE YOUNG MAN	(84-121123-84-121123-0005)
FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WERE HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND PRAYERS	(84-121123-84-121123-0006)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SISTER	(84-121123-84-121123-0007)
OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVOURING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN AND RAVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0008)
DO WE KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED MORREL	(84-121123-84-121123-0009)
NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FORCED HIS ATTENTION	(84-121123-84-121123-0010)
SAID MORREL SADLY OH YES REPLIED NOIRTIER	(84-121123-84-121123-0011)
THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED AT THE DOOR	(84-121123-84-121123-0012)
