REGAINING THE LOW GROUND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HOLDING ON IN YOUR GRAND ORBIT YOU PASS THROUGH A BELT OF JUNIPER WOODS CALLED THE CEDARS TO SHEEP ROC AT THE FOOT OF THE SHASTA PASS	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0021)
HERE YOU STRIKE THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD WHICH LEADS OVER THE LOWER DIVIDE TO THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0022)
MOUNT BREMA IS THE MOST NOTED STRONGHOLD OF THE SHEEP IN THE WHOLE SHASTA REGION	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0023)

THE MULE DEER ARE NEARLY AS THICK	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0026)
THEIR LONG MASSIVE SIDES GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0027)
BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOODS ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD HER EYE	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0028)
THEN FELL THE GLOAMING MAKING EVERYTHING STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MONSTROUS	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0029)
THEN DARKNESS OF DEATH	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0030)

THE DUCKS LESS WARY KEPT THEIR PLACES MERELY SWIMMING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND VARIOUS SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0032)
THEY ARE BROAD RUGGED CREVASSED CLOUDLIKE MASSES OF BROWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING IN SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVER LIKE GO WINDING DOWN VALLEYS THROUGH THE FORESTS TO THE SEA	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0033)
THUS THE SHASTA RIVER ISSUES FROM A LARGE LAKE LIKE SPRING IN SHASTA VALLEY AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE VOLUME OF THE MC CLOUD GUSHES FORTH IN A GRAND SPRING ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN A FEW MILES BACK FROM ITS IMMEDIATE BASE	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0034)
SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEM SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PIT RIVER THAT YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0035)
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YOU CAN HEAR THE ROAR OF THE WATER RUSHING FROM THE ROCK AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OR EVEN MORE OR YOU MAY NOT HEAR IT UNTIL WITHIN A FEW RODS	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0036)
THE VIVID GREEN OF THE BOULDERS BENEATH THE WATER IS VERY STRIKING AND COLOURED THE ENTIRE STREAM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORTIONS BROKEN INTO FOAM	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0037)
ASPLENIUM EPILOBIUM HUTCHEERA HAZEL DOGWOOD AND ALDER MAKE A LUXURIOUS FRINGE AND SETTING AND THE FORESTS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE ALONG THE BANKS ARE THE FINEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE SIERRA	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0038)
TRACING RIVERS TO THEIR FOUNTAINS SEEMS THE MOST CHARMING OF TRAVELS	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0039)
AS THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE LANDSCAPES THE BEST OF THE WILDERNESS COMES TO THEIR BANKS AND NOT ONE DULL PASSAGE WAS FOUND IN ALL THEIR EVENTFUL HISTORIES	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0040)
TRACING THE MC CLOUD TO ITS HIGHEST SPRINGS AND OVER THE DIVIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF FALL RIVER NEAR FORT CROOK THENCE DOWN THAT RIVER TO ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PIT ON FROM THERE TO THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTTE THROUGH THE BIG MEADOWS AMONG THE SOURCES OF THE FEATHER RIVER AND DOWN THROUGH FORESTS OF SUGAR PINES TO THE FERTILE PLAINS OF CHICO THIS IS A GLORIOUS SAUNTER AND IMPOSES NO HARDSHIP	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0041)
THE ASCENT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE WAS AN EASY WALK AND THE VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT ARE EXTREMELY TELLING	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0042)
THE LOFTY ICY SHASTA TOWERING HIGH ABOVE ALL SEEMS BUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM YOU THOUGH THE DISTANCE ON AN AIR LINE IS ABOUT SIXTY MILES	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0043)
THE BIG MEADOWS LIE NEAR THE FOOT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE A BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS BASIN SET IN THE HEART OF THE RICHLY FORESTED MOUNTAINS SCARCELY SURPASSED IN THE GRANDEUR OF ITS SURROUNDINGS BY TAHU	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0044)

EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH WAS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLED AND HARRIED	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0046)
WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THIS FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0000)
INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUE TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0001)
YES AND A VERY REASONABLE ONE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0002)

I SAY IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0010)
THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0011)
A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE THREE PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0012)
I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON A FURTIVE WATCHER	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0013)
I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM MY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0014)
I AM LOOKING AT ME NOW	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0015)

I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO HIS SIDE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0019)
HE WANTEDS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0020)
BUT I EMPHASIZED COMPLACENTLY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0021)
HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0022)

THE TRAIL HERE MIGHT BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0024)
I WISH WE HAD NOT LAUGHED SO SOON	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0025)
HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR MUTUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0026)
HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE GOT A COMFORTABLE CHAT	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0027)
IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE HER A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0028)
THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN USED TO CONSIDER IT	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0029)
THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE FATHER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0030)
THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN TO THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0031)

THAT CLUES THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0033)
THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY AND PERHAPS YOU CAN	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0034)
AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE THOUGHT	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0035)
IT'S A CASE FOR A THOUSAND GRYCE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0036)
THE OLD OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0037)
SHE HAD NO COMPANION WITH HER	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0038)
NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AS SUDDEN FALL	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0039)
IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK ON A BOLT FROM HEAVEN	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0040)

A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPS FORWARD	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0043)
HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO MARGARET	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0044)
THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGEE'S AND MORE OR LESS A FAVORITE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0045)

YES MISS CLARK THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WAS THE PARISHES	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0058)
I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY WELL I SHOULD SAY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0059)

WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK NOW	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0066)
IT HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0067)
THEN THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0068)

AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRICE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0071)
THERE WAS NO ACCOUNTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0072)
YES'	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0073)

THIS MADE THE DIFFERENCE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0076)
MISS CLARK STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY BUT I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0077)
THOUGH A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0078)
AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM THOUGH NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0079)
I KNOW I SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0080)
THERE WAS NO PONYARD IN THE WOUND	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0081)

THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THEIR LADY'S ARMS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0086)
NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HIM IN THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0087)
SHE STRUCK THE BLOW SHARPLY AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0088)
IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAVE BEEN FOUND	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0089)
WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE INSURED ME AN HONORABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE BUT ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0000)
I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THEIR HIGHEST SOCIETY	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0001)
I THOUGHT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0002)
BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY LITTLE PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0003)
OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS ALWAYS EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0004)

WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAVE NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0007)
THERE IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0008)
IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED AGASINO	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0009)
YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES ON WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0010)
THE WAITER OF THE PAGASINO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0011)

TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0016)
I WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0017)
THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0018)
I PICK IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0019)
I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT HIS HOUSE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0020)
I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT IT WAS DYING	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0021)

THINKING I HAD THE RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I STRETCHED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0024)
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME ONCE I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0025)
HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIMSELF	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0026)
THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED CHARO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0027)
DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A WONDERFUL RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0028)
HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL ME THE TRUTH	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0029)
WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS DO SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0030)
UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMERAL CALCULUS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO AND NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKED TO PUT	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0031)

THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY OWN CALCULUS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0037)
NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO EVERY ONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0038)

BUT ALSO BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0040)
THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT OFTEN REAL DEVOTEES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0041)
AS FOR THE EUCHARIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT IS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT JESUITS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0042)

BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENA THEY MEET WITH WHICH THE NARROW INTELLECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0044)

BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AIDED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL	(6319-275224-6319-275224-0016)

IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DEUCALION AND HE WAS THE SOUL OF PROMETHEUS	(6319-57405-6319-57405-0000)
AFTER JUPITER HAD BUILT PROMETHEUS ON MOUNT CAUCASUS AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARES INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED	(6319-57405-6319-57405-0001)
THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS GREAT COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE	(6319-57405-6319-57405-0002)
SO MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND	(6319-57405-6319-57405-0003)
NO ONE BUT DEUCALION THE SON OF PROMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A SCENE	(6319-57405-6319-57405-0004)
THE DAY IS COMING SAID PROMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A CLOUD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH	(6319-57405-6319-57405-0005)
BUT DEUCALION AND PIRHA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND	(6319-57405-6319-57405-0006)
IS THERE ANYTHING WHICH YOU WISH HE ASKED	(6319-57405-6319-57405-0007)
WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DEUCALION TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD WAS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED	(6319-57405-6319-57405-0008)

WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PIERER	(6319-57405-6319-57405-0010)
SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DUUCALION	(6319-57405-6319-57405-0011)
WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A SMALL COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SERVE THEM	(6319-57405-6319-57405-0012)
WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING FEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NOT BEFORE BEEN KNOWN	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0000)

IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ORDER HAS DONE	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0003)
NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER ON THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAT AN HONEST OLD WOMAN SPINNING FOR SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDICT	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0004)
SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THAN BEING HASTY AND JEALOUS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FAINTED AWAY	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0005)
HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT SHAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0006)
ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WITCHES LIVE THERE BUT MOST BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A GREAT OGRE WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0007)
THE YOUNG PRINCE ON THESE WORDS FELT HIMSELF ON FIRE	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0008)
SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS THAT HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0009)
HE ENTERED A LARGE FOUR QUARTER AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AWE	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0010)
BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0011)
HE ENTERED THE GUARD ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDER BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0012)
HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAMBERS OR STANDING	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0013)
I HAVE WAITED LONG FOR HIM	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0014)
THEY WALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND HAD NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0015)
MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN AWAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS BUT THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0016)
THE LADY IN WAITING BECOMING VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0017)
THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDOR BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF THIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0018)
THE VIOLINS AND HOBOYS PLAYING OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND ALMONER MARRIED THE ROYAL LOVERS IN THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0019)
HE HAD TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CASTLE BUT BEHOLD	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0020)
WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEANIE AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONE TO HER TOMB	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0000)
AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED ALIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE AND THE OLD HOUSES INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS IT FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0001)
WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BEANY UNDESIRED HAD KINDLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURAL UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS TERRIBLE	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0002)
SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SWOOPS OF A WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAKE	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0003)
THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD RECALL IT AS SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING FROM IT WITH A CRY	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0004)
SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AND A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0005)
IT WAS THE SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT AT WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLOURS AND ODORS	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0006)
BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THAT GARDEN OPPRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0007)
AT THE END OF IT WE WAS IN A PLACE OF TOMBS	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0008)
SHE ENTERED BUT THE SERVANTS SOFT FOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEEDED HER	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0009)
SHE WAS LOST LOST UTTERLY WITH AN ETERNAL CAUSE	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0010)

SHE HAD LEFT HIM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0013)
HE WALKED TO HER SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GREETING	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0014)
I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO DANGER	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0015)
THE OLD THING WAS BUT A THICKER DREAM AND THIS IS TRUER BECAUSE MORE SHADOWY	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0016)

YOU THINK THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TRYST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POETS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEEKLY JOURNALS	(6345-93302-6345-93302-0002)
SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF HER READING WITH HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SENSE	(6345-93302-6345-93302-0003)
AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY	(6345-93302-6345-93302-0004)

YOUR HANDS AND FEET WERE ACHING WITH COLD	(6345-93302-6345-93302-0011)

THEY LAY IN HEAPS OR DOZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE WORKS	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0023)
THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLE FIELD AMONGST THE UNBURIED DEAD	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0024)
INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT AND THOSE DAYS	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0025)
ROSECRANTZ PROTEST IT WAS IN VAIN	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0026)
IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREATER EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0027)
FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HATCHETRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0028)
A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOGS WERE EATING UP THE BODY OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0029)
LONG AGO THERE LIVED AN MERCHANT WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0000)
EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON A ACCOUNT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0001)
HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED MY FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0002)

I HAVE PITY UPON A POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED OUT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0004)
LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER HER ROOF	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0005)
IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0006)
HE IS GOOD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0007)
IF WE DARE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0008)
BUT WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO YOUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0009)
HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BISHOP	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0010)
IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATEN	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0011)
WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BOYS HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0012)
THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT YET SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0013)
SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAS THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0014)
THEN SHE HEARD HIM COME DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0015)
IT WAS THE YOUNGEST WOMAN WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0016)
PERHAPS WE CAN OUTWIT HER YET ADDED ANOTHER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0017)
THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS SHE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0018)
I PROMISE YOU THAT WILL DO YOU NO HARM	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0019)
YOU MUST NOT COME IN TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0020)
PASS THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID A ROBBER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0021)
WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HOLES IN THE DOOR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0022)
THE FACES AND CURSES OF THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0023)
THEN TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT DOORS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0024)
ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISHNESS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0025)
HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING OF HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0000)
HOW SHOULD WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0001)
OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL THREE DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLAN THE COFFINS FOR US	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0002)
BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH AND I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0003)
AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS CLOTHES AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0004)
AH FATHER SAYS HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0005)
BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE SLIPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0006)
BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BEST TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0007)
EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL STRONGER THAN THE FORMER PIECE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0008)
WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY I WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0009)
HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0010)
COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK EM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0011)
THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAYLAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREAD HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND ATE THEM AND MAKE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0012)
THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR BUT ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0013)
GRETEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT THIS WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0014)
GRETTEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK IT	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0015)
DEAR GOOD GOD HELP US THEN SHE PRAYED	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0016)
CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET THE BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0017)
SEE I COULD ONLY GET IN MYSELF	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0018)
AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER BED INTO THE OVEN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0019)
AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR HE WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0020)
NOW THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0021)
NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECKE FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SIDNEY'S INTEREST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0000)
A SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0001)
THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANDOL	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0002)
RANDAL WAITED A LITTLE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENNYDECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0003)
HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SIDONIA AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0004)
HAD MY BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0005)
RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION KENNEDY PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0006)
AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM CHARLOTTE	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0007)

HE DRANK MY WINE GREEDILY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0009)
WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM HE MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0010)
HE PUT DOWN AN EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0011)
RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SIDNEY WAS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0012)
I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE THE OTHER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0013)
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARKNESS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0014)
I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONG	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0015)
I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT BY MYSELF	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0016)
OH WHY DID YOU ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0017)
I I'M AFRAID HE SAID	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0018)
I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THIS GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0019)
HE SIGHED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0020)
WERE HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0021)

ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SUNDENHAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0000)
THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDLE BOUGHT IT	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0001)
AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE PUBLIC ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0002)
RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN ON THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0003)
WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE REMAINED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0004)
MISSUS NORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME TO DINNER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0005)
MISSUS PRESTY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE CHATEAU	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0006)

BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT CYDENHAM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0009)
THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY DEAR FRIEND	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0010)
BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER HER REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0011)
YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CATHARINE IS A WITCH	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0012)
SIT DOWN SAID MISSUS CRESTY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0013)
YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED IN SANDYSEAL AFTER YOU LEFT US	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0014)

BUT THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KITTY THAT MISSUS NORMAN WAS A WIDOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0018)
WORST STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU THE WORST STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0019)
BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO A UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0020)
I HONESTLY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0021)
AFTER THAT I HAD HER FATHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0022)
SHE ASKED DIRECTLY THAT HER FATHER WAS DEAD	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0023)
THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENCE IS FULLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0024)

A VERY WISE DECIDE SHE REMARKED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0026)
HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN HENNYDECK	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0027)
NOT AT AN HOTEL JUST NOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0028)
IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FATHER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0029)
GOOD BYE DEAR RANDEL	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0030)
ARRIVED AT HIS STATION RANDAL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0031)
WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THAT PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0032)

SUPPOSING A REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0004)
IN THE MEAN TIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES MADE AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0005)
HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARDS PERSUADING CATHARINE TO GRANT SYDNEY AN INTERVIEW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0006)
EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SI DENHAM	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0007)
BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN CAUSE BEFORE HIM NOW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0008)
CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKING THAT LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0009)
WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT IS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0010)
SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I RECEIVE HER TO MORROW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0011)
HE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTERS THAT EVENING	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0012)
BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERINE'S RETURN	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0013)
GO DO YOU CARE	(84-121123-84-121123-0000)
BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH THEIR EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT	(84-121123-84-121123-0001)
AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTRED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WERE STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF THE CRY	(84-121123-84-121123-0002)
AND THE CRIES ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE	(84-121123-84-121123-0003)
DAVERNIE RUSHED TOWARD THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0004)
D'UVERIGNY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN	(84-121123-84-121123-0005)
FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CABIN BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND PRAYERS	(84-121123-84-121123-0006)
WHICH DO YOU MEAN SIR	(84-121123-84-121123-0007)
OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVOURING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH SHE WAS TAKEN I RAVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0008)
DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED MOREREL	(84-121123-84-121123-0009)
NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON WARREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION	(84-121123-84-121123-0010)
SAID MORREL SADLY YES EXCLAIMED NOIRTIER	(84-121123-84-121123-0011)
THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED IN THE DOOR	(84-121123-84-121123-0012)
CALLED MORREL YES	(84-121123-84-121123-0013)
