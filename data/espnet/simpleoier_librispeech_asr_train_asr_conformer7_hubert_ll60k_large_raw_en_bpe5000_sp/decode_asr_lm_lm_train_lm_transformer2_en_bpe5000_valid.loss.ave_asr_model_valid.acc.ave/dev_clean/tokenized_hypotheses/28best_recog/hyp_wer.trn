HOW WOULD THE PAPERS TALK ABOUT HIM	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0004)
MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BROW MORE MOISTENED	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0005)
HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR CAREY SHOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0006)
HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO MARRY AS USUAL	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0007)

WHILE THE DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALIZED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS NEWS	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0009)

HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOUR WORDS IN REPLY GO TO A DEVIL	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0018)
BUT HE COMPROMISED BY TELLING THE KING THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0019)
THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT IN HIS WORK	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0020)
WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THE CONFOUNDED WRETCHES	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0021)
LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISCRETION ASSERTED ITSELF AND	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0022)
SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CLIMAX WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT GET IDLE	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0023)

HE AROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOKED OFF INTO THE STREET	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0025)

BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN SHIP HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER AND OVER THAT SOME SOLUTION WOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0032)
THEN HE RANG THE BELL FOR NO ANSWER	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0033)
HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL NO ANSWER AND	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0034)

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION AND	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0000)
THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY GENERAL ONE	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0001)
ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISING TO THE PRINTER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0002)
THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE AND ONE ANOTHER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0003)

I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER REUBENNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0010)

AS ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN ERA LABOURS UNDER A TROUBLESOME DISADVANTAGE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0000)
IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT DISADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR WHILE THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HEINOUS WAS STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THE SINS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH SHE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY TO STATE THE CHURCH'S CASE FAR MORE WEAKLY THAN THE FACTS DESERVE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0001)

BUT IF THE EMPERORS HAD BECOME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAD NOTHING	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0006)
IN THE MEAN WHILE THE MINDS OF MEN CUT ADRIFT FROM THEIR ANCIENT MOORINGS WANDERED WILDLY OVER PATHLESS SEAS OF SPECULATIVE DOUBT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE METAPHYSICAL AND CONTEMPLATIVE EAST ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE FOR THEMSELVES THE QUESTIONS OF MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNSEEN BY THOSE THOUSANDS SCHISMS HERESIES AND THEOSOPHIES IT IS A DISGRACE TO THE WORD PHILOSOPHY TO CALL THEM BY IT ON THE RECORDS OF WHICH THE STUDENT NOW GAZES BEWILDERED UNABLE ALIKE TO COUNT OR TO EXPLAIN THEIR FANTASIES	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0007)
THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCHMEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS THAT MUST BE SOLVED UNLESS THE CHURCH WAS TO RELINQUISH FOREVER HER CLAIMS AS THE GREAT TEACHER AND SATISFIER OF THE HUMAN SOUL	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0008)
BUT THE HEALTH OF A CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE CREED WHICH IT PROFESSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF A FEW GREAT ECCLESIASTICS BUT ON THE FAITH AND VALUE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0009)

CLIMATE BAD EXAMPLE AND THE LUXURY OF POWER DEGRADED THEM IN ONE CENTURY INTO A RACE OF HELPLESS AND DEBAUCHED SLAVEHOLDERS DOOMED TO UTTER EXTERMINATION BEFORE THE SEMI GOTHIC ARMIES OF BELISARIUS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE LAST CHANCE THAT THE GOTHIC GRACES WOULD EXERCISE ON THE EASTERN WORLD THE SAME STERN YET WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH THE WESTERN HAD BEEN RESTORED TO LIFE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0017)
THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSIC SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN UNMEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT THAT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOMO IOSEUS AND HOMO IOSIUS MIGHT HANG THE SOLUTIONS OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET TO BATTLE IN ALEXANDRIA THE ANCIENT STRONGHOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THE EFFET REMAINS OF THE VERY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED ITS EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0018)

BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME BETTER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0003)

THE CLOUD OF REBELS WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED HIMSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0021)
A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TOO MOWED THEM DOWN LIKE A GRASS	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0022)
THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DOZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE MARKS	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0023)
THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARDS UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AMONG THE UNBURIED DEAD	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0024)
INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD A LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT IN THOSE DAYS	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0025)
BUT ROSECRANTZ PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0026)
IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE FRANCE THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0027)
FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HATCHEY BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0028)
A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE FROM THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOGS WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0029)
LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MONARCH WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0000)
EVERY YEAR AT THE CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON AN ACCOUNT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0001)
HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER THAT I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0002)
WHILE IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BAND INTO A NEAR BY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0003)
HAVE PITY UPON A POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED IT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0004)
LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS MY NIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0005)
IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORWAYS AND WINDOWS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0006)
THAT IS OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0007)
IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BABY IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0008)
BUT WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR MOTHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0009)
HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL THAT SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BEGGAR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0010)
IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR CRIED THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0011)
WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BEGGAR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING WATER OVER THEM	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0012)
THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THIS NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0013)
SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPY POWDER HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0014)
BUT SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0015)
IT WERE THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0016)
YES WE CAN OUTWIT HER YET CRIED ANOTHER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0017)
THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ASK BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0018)
I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO HIM NO HARM	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0019)
YOU SHALL NOT COME AT MY FATHER'S HOUSE	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0020)
PASS THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE GOVERNOR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0021)
WHEN SHE APPEARED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE DOOR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0022)
THEN CRIES AND CURSES OF THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0023)
THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GATE DOORS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0024)
ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE TOO FOOLISH	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0025)
HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SANG AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0000)
HOW CAN WE FEED MY CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0001)
OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE AND THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLAN THE COFFINS FOR US	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0002)
BUT SHE LEFT THEM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0003)
AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUTSIDE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0004)
AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THAT HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0005)
BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATCH	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0006)
BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST OF THE CHILDREN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0007)
EARLY IN THAT MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0008)
WE ARE GOING INTO A FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0009)
HANSEL THOUGHT THIS ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0010)
COME IN AND STOCK WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0011)
THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAYLAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREAD HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICED THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0012)
THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY WAS OF NO USE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0013)
GRETEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE LITTLE WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0014)
GRETTEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BETEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0015)
DEAR GOOD GOD KEEP US NOW SHE PRAYED	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0016)
CREEP IN SAID THE WIDOW AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0017)
TO SEE I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0018)
HAD SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0019)
AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS OR PRECIOUS STONES	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0020)
THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING FROM THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0021)
NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SYDNEY'S INTEREST TO MAKE INQUIRIES IN HIS CLUB	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0000)
THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THIS CRUISE WAS OVER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0001)
THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED HIM PUZZLED RANDAL	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0002)
RANDAL WAITED A WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENNYDECK MIGHT PAY HER A VISIT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0003)
HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF CYDONUM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0004)
HE HAD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0005)
RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION INTENDING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION KATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0006)
AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT OF HERBERT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0007)
YOU WILL DISTRESS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0008)
HE DRANK THE VINE GREEDILY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0009)
WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCE ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0010)
HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY BOX TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0011)
RANDAL HE SAID YOU CAN KNOW WHERE SYDNEY IS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0012)
I COULD DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0013)
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND YET TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0014)
I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT OLD	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0015)
I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR YOURSELF	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0016)
OH WHY DID I DRAG THAT GOVERNESS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0017)
I'M AFRAID THAT HE SAID	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0018)
I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT A GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0019)
HE PAUSE AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0020)
WAS MY MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0021)
BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0022)
LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS JUST	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0023)
I FEEL FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID BRIEFLY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0024)
SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT WE CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0025)
LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED FOR I'M NOT IN THE WAY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0026)
HE MENTIONED THE NAMES OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAK UP OF THE FAMILY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0027)
ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SOIDENHAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0000)
THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDAL BENT IT	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0001)
AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE ACQUAINTANCE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0002)
AND RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0003)
WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WILL PROVE TO BE A STRANGER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0004)
MISSUS NORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND BUT WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0005)
MISSUS CRESTY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0006)
HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO MUCH SHE BEGAN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0007)
SHE HAD ADDED LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0008)
BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SOYNHAM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0009)
THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0010)
BUT IF THE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER A REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0011)
YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CATHERINE IS A WIDOW AND	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0012)
SIT DOWN SAID MISSUS CRUSTY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0013)
YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSELF AFTER YOU LEFT US	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0014)
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERCY ON HER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0015)
HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS HAMILTON'S LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0016)
WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBANDS MIGHT BE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0017)
AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KITTY THAT MISSUS JAMES WAS A WIDOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0018)
OUR STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0019)
BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE COUNT'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0020)
IT HONESTLY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0021)
AFTER THAT I HAD THEIR MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0022)
SHE ASKED DIRECTLY AS HER FATHER WAS DEAD	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0023)
THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENSE IS FULLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0024)
RANDAL PASSED THIS OVER IT WITHOUT NOTICE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0025)
A VERY WISE DECISION THEN SHE REMARKED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0026)
HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BENNY DICK	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0027)
NOT AT THE HOTEL NO	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0028)
IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARDS BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS SON	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0029)
GOOD GOOD BYE DEAR RANDAL	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0030)
ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDAL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THIS TRAIN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0031)
WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORMS WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0032)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED AND	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0000)
YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN KAVERINE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0001)
WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0002)
NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE EDITOR CAN APPLY	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0003)
BUT SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0004)
IN THE MEAN TIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED A INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0005)
HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SYDNEY THE INTERVIEW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0006)
EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO CIDENHAM	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0007)
BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NO	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0008)
CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEM TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE BROTHER	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0009)
WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIENDS'S WIFE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0010)
SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEND HER TO MORROW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0011)
SHE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0012)
BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR KEITH'S REPLY	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0013)
GO D YOU HEAR	(84-121123-84-121123-0000)
BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTERNAL WEIGHT	(84-121123-84-121123-0001)
AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTRED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLING HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY	(84-121123-84-121123-0002)
AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SOUND	(84-121123-84-121123-0003)
DAVERGY RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0004)
DAVERIGNY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HANDS TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN	(84-121123-84-121123-0005)
FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND FEARS	(84-121123-84-121123-0006)
OF WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIR	(84-121123-84-121123-0007)
OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVOURING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVES	(84-121123-84-121123-0008)
DO YOU MEAN THE ASSASSIN ASKED MORREL	(84-121123-84-121123-0009)
NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HER ATTENTION	(84-121123-84-121123-0010)
SAID MORREL SADLY YES HE REPLIED NOIRTIER	(84-121123-84-121123-0011)
THE OLD MAN'S EYES FIXED ON THE DOOR	(84-121123-84-121123-0012)
ASKED MORREL THIS	(84-121123-84-121123-0013)
