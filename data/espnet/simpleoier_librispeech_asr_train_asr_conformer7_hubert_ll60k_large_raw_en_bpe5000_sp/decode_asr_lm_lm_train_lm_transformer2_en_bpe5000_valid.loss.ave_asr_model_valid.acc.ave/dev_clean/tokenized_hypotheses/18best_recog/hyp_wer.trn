THIS INSTANCE OF PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST	(1272-141231-1272-141231-0003)
ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND A TIME BUZZING SOUNDED	(1272-141231-1272-141231-0004)
A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY IS NEEDED EVERY FRACTION OF IT	(1272-141231-1272-141231-0005)

THE CONTESTANTS ON THE TWENTIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS IN THE DORMITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH	(1272-141231-1272-141231-0009)
PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICLES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY ROOMS	(1272-141231-1272-141231-0010)

EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE TWENTIES HAD HIS OWN TRAINING AND TRICKS	(1272-141231-1272-141231-0021)

THE STRENGTH IT ENABLES SOME ONE IN A TRANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS	(1272-141231-1272-141231-0023)

IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH AMUSEMENT SIR HARRY'S JUDICIAL FROWNS	(1462-170138-1462-170138-0023)
HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAMED FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAYN HALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT	(1462-170138-1462-170138-0024)

HOW WOULD THE PAPERS TELL ABOUT IT	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0004)
MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS HANDS AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BROW MOISTENED	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0005)

HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO BED AS USUAL	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0007)
FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING COULD COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANNED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0008)
WHILE THIS DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALIZED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0009)

HE WOULD GET ONE TO SAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0013)

HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM BARRIE	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0015)

AT ONE FORTY HE WENT TO RECTOR'S FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0017)
HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOUR WORDS IN REPLY GO TO THE DEVILS	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0018)
BUT THEY COMPROMISED BY TELLING THE BOY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0019)
THEN HE SANK DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0020)
WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THE CONFOUNDED RUSSIAN	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0021)
LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISCRETION ASSERTS ITSELF	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0022)
SOMETHING WAS TO BE DONE A CLIMAX WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SIT IDLE	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0023)
HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT SHE HAD DECIDED UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0024)
HE AROSE FROM A CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0025)

HE PUT IN HIS HAT AND LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS UMBRELLA	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0028)

THEN HE RANG THE BELL AN ANSWER	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0033)
HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL IN ANSWER	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0034)
WHEN HURSTWOOD CAME BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0000)
SHE COULD HARDLY REALISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0001)
NO LETTER HAD COME NOR WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING	(2277-149897-2277-149897-0002)

PREFACE TO MY SECOND EDITION	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0000)
THIS IS A MISTAKEN THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0001)
ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST AVISES TO THE PRINTER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0002)
NOW I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0003)
I REPEAT THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0004)
I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WOULD SUFFICE	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0005)
BUT IT HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFELONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0006)
I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO OUR CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0007)
IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER ARGOTADA DISTRICT OF THE CANTERBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRISTCHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0008)
I ALSO WROTE BY THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0009)
I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP UNTIL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TROUBNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0010)
I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVOURABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0011)
THERE HAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUSE	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0012)

I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRYING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOLDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STEREOS THEN MADE	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0014)
I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EREWHON THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE WHICH HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0015)
THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPY WRITER WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0016)
IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO THEM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0000)
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP SOME PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0001)

SHE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0005)
I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE THREE HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING EWES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0006)

IT IS SURPRISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING ANOTHER SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0008)
IT WAS A MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DO NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0009)
HIS COUNTRY WAS THE GRANDEST THAT CAN BE IMAGINED	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0010)

EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHT	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0012)
I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BORROWED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A NEW MAN	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0013)
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD HE HOPE TO CROSS IT	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0014)
I WOULD TRY THE HIGHER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0015)
SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIDST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0000)
OUR GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOR I THEM	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0001)
THESE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0002)
A VINE GREW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0003)
EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF SHOPLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGETATED SOMEHOW THO AS IN AN HEIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEAKEST	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0004)
EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALWAYS INVARIABLY PERFECT	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0005)
THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS AND GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHT OF THEIR CONVERSION AND FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0006)
EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMELY AND THE OLD GREY HEADED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0007)
THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN BEAUTY	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0008)
I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGYPTIAN MUSIC AND ITALIAN	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0009)
THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY AS THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0010)
I EXPRESS BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0011)
THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND OTHER TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0012)
HE SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAILS	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0013)
IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FOR THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0014)
SUFFICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HAPPY	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0015)
IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND COUGHED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SPITE OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS HIM	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0016)
THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELLOUSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH HIM	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0017)

WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCKS TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHES	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0021)
HIS DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0022)
THESE HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HIM	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0023)
HE BEGAN APPARENTLY TO RELENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KINDER MANNER	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0024)
I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP IN MY CHAMBERS AND HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FESTIVE SEASON	(2428-83699-2428-83699-0000)

I WISH WE HAD NEVER LEFT SO SOON	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0025)

IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER WORDS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0028)
THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY HOPELESS AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0029)
THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD BEEN PLACED	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0030)

AND SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0038)
NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN CALL	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0039)
IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BLOW FROM HEAVEN	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0040)

WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE INSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE BUT ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0000)

BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF THE OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0003)

AND WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR AND DRINKING	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0017)
THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEARS HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0018)

IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ERROR HAS DONE	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0003)
NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAT AN HONEST OLD WOMAN SPINNING FOR SHE NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDICT	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0004)

HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT WALK FOR A HUNDRED YEARS	(6319-64726-6319-64726-0006)

AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED ALIKE OVER THE NEW GRAVE AND THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS IT FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE	(6345-64257-6345-64257-0001)

IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHAT HE AFTERWARD BECAME	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0027)
FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HATCHERY BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0028)
A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY MOTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOGS WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR	(7976-105575-7976-105575-0029)
LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT WHO HAD FIVE DAUGHTERS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0000)
EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY AN ACCOUNT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0001)
WHY DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0002)

LET ME ENTER I BEG YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0005)
IT'S USUALLY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0006)
HE IS OLD AS WELL AS DEAR SHE SAID	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0007)
IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0008)
BUT WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0009)
HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE VICTOR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0010)
IT IS A CHEERFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0011)
WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BEGGAR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED HER SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0012)
THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT WHEN SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0013)
SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD SURELY DONE ITS WORK	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0014)
THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED FROM THE STORE	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0015)
IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME REPLIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0016)
PERHAPS WE CAN OUTFIT HER YET CRIED ANOTHER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0017)
THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING FOR HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0018)
I PROMISE YOU HE WILL DO YOU NO HARM	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0019)
YE SHALL NOT COME IN TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0020)
PASS THE CHARM OUT TO ME NOW SAID THE ROBBER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0021)
WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH HOLE IN THE DOOR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0022)
THE CRIES AND CURSES OF THE ROBBER FILLED THE AIR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0023)
THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THEIR GREAT DOORS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0024)
ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE PLEASANT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0025)
HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED THAT NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0000)
WHY CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0001)
OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLANNED THE COFFINS FOR US	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0002)
BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THAT POOR CHILDREN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0003)
AND AS SOON AS THEIR PATIENT HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0004)
AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRY TO SAY GOOD BYE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0005)
BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPT A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0006)
BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE A LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0007)
EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PUSHED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0008)
WE'RE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0009)
HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF THE GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0010)
GO IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0011)
THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO HIM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAYLAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREAD HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0012)
THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH THE LATTICED DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0013)
GRETEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH HAD MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0014)
GRETTEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE THE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0015)
THERE GOOD GOD HELP US NOW SHE PRAYED	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0016)
CREEP IN SAYS THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0017)
YOU SEE I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0018)
WHEN SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0019)
AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER ARE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0020)
THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSH INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0021)
NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SIDNEY'S INTEREST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUBS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0000)
THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISED WAS OVER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0001)
THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED CAUSED RANDAL	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0002)
RANDAL WAITED A WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BONNYDECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0003)
HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SATINUM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0004)
HAD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0005)
RANDAL ROSE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION KATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0006)
AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM EUROPE	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0007)
YOU DISTRESS ME HURT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0008)
HE DRANK THE WINE GREEDILY AND	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0009)
WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS NATURE	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0010)
HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS FRIEND'S QUESTION	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0011)
RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SIR SYDNEY IS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0012)
I WILL SAY NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0013)
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF ME AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0014)
I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THE ALONE	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0015)
I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO TAKE IT FOR MYSELF	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0016)
WHY WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0017)
I'M AFRAID YOU SAID	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0018)
I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT GLASS I TAKE JUST NOW	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0019)
HE PASSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0020)
WAS HER MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0021)
YOU CAN'T DO IT IT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0022)
LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS NEXT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0023)
I FEEL FOR YOU HURT HE SAID WARMLY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0024)

LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I'M NOT IN THIS WAY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0026)
HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLDER SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAK UP OF THE FAMILY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0027)
ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SIENHAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0000)
THAT NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDAL BOUGHT IT	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0001)
AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THESE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0002)
RANDLE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0003)
WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT A CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0004)
MISSUS NORMAN AND THE LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0005)
MISSUS PRESTY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTELS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0006)
HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE DEMANDED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0007)
SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM MYSTERIOUSLY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0008)
BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SYDENHAM IN A MATTER OF NEWS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0009)
THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY YOUNG FRIEND	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0010)
BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER HER REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVOURITE NEWSPAPERS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0011)
YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CATARINE IS A WIDOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0012)
SIT DOWN NOW SAID MISSUS PRESTY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0013)
YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSEAL AFTER YOU LEFT	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0014)
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR A COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERCY ON HER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0015)
HE IS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS NORMAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0016)
WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0017)
AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KITTY THAT MISSUS NORMAN IS A WIDOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0018)
THE WORST STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU WORST STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0019)
BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH A MOTHER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0020)
SO HONESTLY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0021)
AFTER THAT I HAD YOUR MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0022)
SHE ASKED DIRECTLY IF YOUR FATHER WAS DEAD	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0023)
THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENCE IS CLEARLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0024)
RANDAL PASSED THIS UP WITHOUT NOTICE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0025)
A VERY WIDE DECISION SHE REMARKED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0026)
HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BENNYDICK	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0027)
NOT AT THE HOTELS JUST NOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0028)
IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARDS BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIENDS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0029)
GOOD BYE DEARS RANDAL	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0030)
ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDAL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THEIR TRAIN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0031)
WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH THE MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0032)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE HE ASKED	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0000)
YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERINE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0001)
WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THINGS UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0002)
NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE EDITOR CANNOT SUPPLY	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0003)
SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN SURE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0004)
IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN THE FATHER AND CHILD	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0005)
HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING KATHARINE TO GRANT SIDNEY AN INTERVIEW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0006)
EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO YDENHAM	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0007)
BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL CAN SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0008)
CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEM TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN OF AN INTIMATE FRIEND	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0009)
WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS MOTHER'S WIFE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0010)
SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN YOU SEE HER TO MORROW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0011)
HE ADDED SIDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT MORNING	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0012)
BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR HELEN'S REPLY	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0013)
GO DO YOU	(84-121123-84-121123-0000)
BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH HER EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT	(84-121123-84-121123-0001)
AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED ALTERED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY	(84-121123-84-121123-0002)
THEN THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE	(84-121123-84-121123-0003)
DAVERNEY RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0004)
D'VERNY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN	(84-121123-84-121123-0005)
FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND PRAISES	(84-121123-84-121123-0006)
WHERE DO YOU MEAN SIR	(84-121123-84-121123-0007)
OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVOURING TO ESCAPE THE NET INTO WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0008)

NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FILLED HIS ATTENTION	(84-121123-84-121123-0010)
SAID MORVEL SADLY YES REPLIED NOIRTIER	(84-121123-84-121123-0011)
THAT OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED ON THE DOOR	(84-121123-84-121123-0012)
EXCLAIMED MORREL YES	(84-121123-84-121123-0013)

M MORREL SUFFERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM	(84-121123-84-121123-0018)
