THEN HE COMPROMISED BY TELLING THE BOY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0019)
THEN HE SAT BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0020)
WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THIS CONFOUNDED WRETCH	(2277-149896-2277-149896-0021)

PREFACE OF THE SECOND EDITION	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0000)
THERE IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0001)
ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVVISES TO THE PRINTER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0002)
THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN WRITING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0003)
I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS IN MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0004)
I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO A REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0005)
BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS OBLIGED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFELONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0006)
I WILL NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0007)

I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRAUBER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0010)
I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVOURABLE VIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0011)

I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EREWHON THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAVE ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0015)
THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPY WRITING WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0016)
IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO ME AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0000)

I WOULD TRY THE NEARER CHANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0015)

EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYESLIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0005)
THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY AND WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION AND FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0006)

THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBERS AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0010)

I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS MOUTHS	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0013)
IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THE MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0014)

THEIR FRIENDS DID THE BEST TO AMUSE THEM	(2803-154320-2803-154320-0002)
THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED BY THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED	(2803-154320-2803-154320-0003)
MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION OF THE PAMPAS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS	(2803-154320-2803-154320-0004)
HIS EYES WANDERED LISTLESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORIZON	(2803-154320-2803-154320-0005)

WE SHOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT	(2803-154320-2803-154320-0010)
THINK OF LADY GLENARVAN I THINK OF MARY GRANT	(2803-154320-2803-154320-0011)
WILL HALLEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKED DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN	(2803-154320-2803-154320-0012)

THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAHITI RANGES WERE LIT WITH THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0000)
WE HAD ONE NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0001)
THE MEALS ENDED	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0002)
SOMETHING WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ABEYANCE SOON WEIGHED DOWN THEIR EYELIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WATCHING	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0003)
IF IT IS DECREED THAT WE DIE TO TOMORROW LET US DIE BRAVELY LIKE CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERROR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0004)

JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISED MARY WHICH I PROMISED LADY HELENA WHAT IS YOUR PLAN	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0007)
I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FULFIL MY PROMISE	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0008)

DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS IT SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LED TO THIS UNDERTAKING	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0017)
THEIR FINGERS BLED BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THIRTY FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASED SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LAYER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0018)
JOHN MANGLES INSERTING THE BLADE OF HIS PONIARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PROTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND WHICH WIELDED IT	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0019)
BUT SOFTLY AS HER NAME WAS BREATHED MARY GRANT ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARDS GLENARVAN AND SEIZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0020)

THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OR FOUNTAINS WITH THEIR SONGS	(2803-161169-2803-161169-0001)

LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT HER SIDE	(2803-161169-2803-161169-0006)
SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS A MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LYING ASLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STROWED AMONG THEM	(2803-161169-2803-161169-0007)

FERNS AND PALMS AND MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES	(2803-161169-2803-161169-0009)
AND WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL	(2803-161169-2803-161169-0010)
WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYTHING HAD KEPT ON BURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY	(2803-161169-2803-161169-0011)
THESE FORESTS WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WE HAVE NOW GREAT FERNS AS TALL AS THE HOUSES AND MOSSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PALM LEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE	(2803-161169-2803-161169-0012)
THEN THE WALLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND	(2803-161169-2803-161169-0013)

IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT	(2803-161169-2803-161169-0015)

ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN ERA LABOURED UNDER A TROUBLESOME DISADVANTAGE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0000)
IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT DISADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR WHILE THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HEINOUS WERE STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THE SINS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH HE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY TO STATE THE CHURCH'S CASE FAR MORE WEAKLY THAN THE FACTS DESERVE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0001)
NOT BE IT EVER REMEMBERED THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF IMMORALITY ATTACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSOPHERS IN HER SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0002)

THE VERY EMPERORS HAD ARRAYED THEMSELVES ON OUR SIDE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0004)
JULIAN'S LAST ATTEMPT TO RESTORE PAGANISM BY IMPERIAL INFLUENCE HAD ONLY PROVED THAT THE OLD FAITH HAD LOST ALL HOLD UPON THE HEARTS OF THE MASSES AT HIS DEATH THE GREAT TIDE WAVE OF OPINION ROLLED ON UNCHECKED AND THE RULERS OF EARTH WERE FAIN TO SWIM WITH THE STREAM TO ACCEPT IN WORDS AT LEAST THE CHURCH'S LAWS AS THEIRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A KING OF KINGS TO WHOM EVEN THEY OWED HOMAGE AND OBEDIENCE AND TO CALL THEIR OWN SLAVES THEIR POORER BRETHREN AND OFTEN TOO THEIR SPIRITUAL SUPERIORS	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0005)
BUT THE EMPERORS HAD BECOME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAD NOT	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0006)
IN THE MEANTIME THE MINDS OF MEN CUT ADRIFT FROM THEIR ANCIENT MOORINGS WANDERED WILDLY OVER PATHLESS SEAS OF SPECULATIVE DOUBT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE METAPHYSICAL AND CONTEMPLATIVE EAST ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE FOR THEMSELVES THE QUESTIONS OF MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNSEEN BY THOSE THOUSAND SCHISMS HERESIES AND THEOSOPHIES IT IS A DISGRACE TO THE WORD PHILOSOPHY TO CALL THEM BY IT ON THE RECORDS OF WHICH THE STUDENT NOW GAZES BEWILDERED UNABLE ALIKE TO COUNT OR TO EXPLAIN THEIR PHANTASIES	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0007)
THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCHMEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE SOLVED UNLESS THE CHURCH WAS TO RELINQUISH FOR EVER HER CLAIMS AS THE GREATEST TEACHER AND SATISFIER OF THE HUMAN SOUL	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0008)
BUT THE HEALTH OF A CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE CREEDS WHICH IT PROFESSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF A FEW GREAT ECCLESIASTICS BUT ON THE FAITH AND VIRTUE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0009)
THE MANS SANA MUST HAVE A CORPUS SANNUM TO INHABIT	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0010)

TRIBE AFTER TRIBE WAS CROWDING DOWN TO THE ALPS AND TRAMPLING UPON EACH OTHER THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0012)
THE HUNS SINGLY THEIR INFERIORS PRESSED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS ITALY WITH HER RICH CITIES AND FERTILE LOWLANDS BECKONED THEM ON TO PLUNDER AS AUXILIARIES THEY HAD LEARNED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND A GERMAN WEAKNESS A CASUS BELLI WAS SOON FOUND	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0013)
HOW INIQUITOUS WAS THE CONDUCT OF THE SONS OF THEODOSIUS IN REFUSING THE USUAL BOUNTY BY WHICH THE GOTHS WERE BRIBED NOT TO ATTACK THE EMPIRE THE WHOLE PENT UP DELUGE BURST OVER THE PLAINS OF ITALY AND THE SOUTHERN EMPIRE BECAME FROM THAT DAY FORTH A DYING IDIOT WHILE THE NEW INVADERS DIVIDED EUROPE AMONG THEMSELVES	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0014)
THE COUNTLESS TREASURES WHICH FIVE CENTURIES OF RAPINE HAD ACCUMULATED ROUND THE CAPITAL HAD BECOME THE PREY OF MEN CLOTHED IN SHEEPSKINS AND HORSEHIDE AND THE SISTER OF AN EMPEROR HAD FOUND HER BEAUTY VIRTUE AND PRIDE OF RACE WORTHILY MATCHED BY THOSE OF THE HARD HANDED NORTHERN HERO WHO LED HER AWAY FROM ITALY AS HIS CAPTIVES AND HIS BRIDE TO FOUND NEW KINGDOMS IN SOUTH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND TO DRIVE THE NEWLY ARRIVED VANDALS ACROSS THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR INTO THE THEN BLOOMING COASTLAND OF NORTHERN AFRICA	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0015)
THAT EXTRAORDINARY REFORM IN MORALS WHICH ACCORDING TO SALVIAN AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES THE VANDAL CONQUERORS WORKED IN NORTHERN AFRICA AVAILED THEM NOTHING THEY LOST MORE THAN THEY GAVE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0016)
CLIMATE BAD EXAMPLE AND THE LUXURY OF POWER DEGRADED THEM IN ONE CENTURY INTO A RACE OF HELPLESS AND DEBAUCHED SLAVEHOLDERS DOOMED TO UTTER EXTERMINATION BEFORE THE SEMI GOTHIC ARMIES OF BELISARIUS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE LAST CHANCE THAT THE GOTHIC RACES WOULD EXERCISE IN THE EASTERN WORLD THE SAME STERN YET WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH THE WESTERN HAD BEEN RESTORED TO LIFE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0017)
THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSIC SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN UNMEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT THAT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOMO EUOSEUS AND HOMO IOSIUS MIGHT HANG THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET TO BATTLE IN ALEXANDRIA THE ANCIENT STRONGHOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THE EFFHEAT REMAINS OF THE VERY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED ITS EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0018)

I CANNOT HOPE THAT THESE PAGES WILL BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM ANACHRONISMS OR ERRORS	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0020)

THE ROOM HAD NEITHER CARPET NOR FIREPLACE AND THE ONLY MOVABLES IN IT WERE A SOFA BED A TABLE AND AN ARMCHAIR ALL OF SUCH DELICATE AND GRACEFUL FORMS AS MAY BE SEEN ON ANCIENT VASES OF A FAR EARLIER PERIOD THAN THAT WHEREOF WE WROTE	(2902-9008-2902-9008-0001)
BUT MOST PROBABLY HAD ANY OF US ENTERED THAT ROOM THAT MORNING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPARE A LOOK EITHER FOR THE FURNITURE OR THE GENERAL EFFECT OR THE MUSEUM GARDENS OR THE SPARKLING MEDITERRANEAN BEYOND BUT WE SHOULD HAVE AGREED THAT THE ROOM WAS QUITE LARGE ENOUGH FOR HUMAN EYES FOR THE SAKE OF ONE TREASURE WHICH IT POSSESSED AND BESIDE WHICH NOTHING WAS WORTH A MOMENT'S GLANCE	(2902-9008-2902-9008-0002)

ARCTIC BEAUTY AND DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ALL MAY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLIMBERS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN AS GOING AROUND ITS WARM FERTILE BASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0001)

I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO MUCH	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0025)

BUT CLUES THERE WERE ABSOLUTELY NONE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0033)
THIS IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0034)
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0035)

HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGES	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0044)
THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGEES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0045)

I BELIEVE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0059)

WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FARTHER	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0066)
IT HAD NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0067)

AS HER BRIGHT FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0071)
THERE WAS NO DOUBTING THEM IN HIS INSTANCE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0072)
PERHAPS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0073)

SO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0078)
AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS ADMISSION	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0079)
I KNOW SHE SAID YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0080)
THERE WAS NO PONIARD IN HIS WOUND	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0081)

THE NEXT MINUTE SHE IS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0086)
NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER AT THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0087)
SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OFF AND FLING IT FROM HER	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0088)
IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0089)
WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE INSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MERE FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0000)
I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I CAN EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0001)
I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE HIGHEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0002)
BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND A VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0003)
OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS EVEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0004)

WE DO THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCELLENT HEALTH	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0006)
WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELLS AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0007)
THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED MY EXPLOITS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0008)
IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MEGASIN	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0009)
THEN THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0010)

FOUR DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0016)
AND WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SEX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0017)
THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRADE AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0018)
I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT HIM	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0019)
I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD MEET ME AT MY HOUSE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0020)

I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RIGETTA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I INQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0022)
TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT TO A PHYSICIAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLED AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0023)
FINDING I HAD THE RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0024)
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHENCE I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0025)
HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS WIFE WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0026)
THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TURNO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0027)
WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0028)
HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL HIM A TRUTH	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0029)
WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS MAY SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0030)
UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMERAL CALCULUS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I WANTED TO PUT	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0031)
I OBEYED IMPLICITLY AND SENT YOUR EXCELLENCY	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0032)
THE THREE FRIENDS WAS ASTOUNDED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0033)
I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS HAD DONE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0034)
HE WROTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE ANSWER	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0035)
THOUGH THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0036)
THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF OUR SUBLIME CALCULUS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0037)
NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SILENCE TO ANY ONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0038)
THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS AND THEY HAVE NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0039)
BUT THOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0040)
THEY WERE NOT ONLY GREAT CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVOTEES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0041)
AS FOR THE EUCHARIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NO JESUITS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0042)
I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISHED TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0043)
BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENON THEY MET WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELLECTS CANNOT UNDERSTAND	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0044)

EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISTER WOODLEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0001)
YET DID THAT WATCHFUL MISS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0002)

IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS THAT MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HERS	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0012)
DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MILNER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEETH IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0013)

MISS WOODSLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE JINGLE OF A TEASPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0018)
MISSUS HORTON TOO WITH THE SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0019)
MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY ARE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0020)

IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A WORD TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0025)
FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF EVERY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0026)

IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAS MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0003)
MISSUS BOSTIL WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0004)

BASIL HAS ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0019)
IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOSLL TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0020)
PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TREVELLION	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0021)

I HAD THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0015)

THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AS THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0003)
YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY COULD WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0004)
THEY DID NOT BREATHE INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0005)

HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS THAT MIGHT COME UPON YOU	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0002)
WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BAND INTO A NEAR BY STREET AND IN ITS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0003)

LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER THEIR ROOF	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0005)
IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AND THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0006)
HE IS YOUNG AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0007)
IF WE TRY TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0008)
THAT WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0009)
HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE EMPEROR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0010)
IT IS A FRIGHTFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0011)
WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE GOVERNOR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0012)
THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES AND THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0013)
SHE DID NOT STIR AND SHE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0014)
THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LEAD INTO THE STORE	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0015)
THAT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0016)
PERHAPS HE CAN OUTWIT HER YET CRIED ANOTHER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0017)
THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE PRESENTLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0018)
I PROMISE YOU IT WILL DO YOU NO HARM	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0019)
YOU SHOULD NOT COME INTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0020)
PASS A CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0021)
WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HOLE IN A DOOR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0022)
THE CRIES AND CURSES OF THE TRAVELLERS FILLED THE AIR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0023)
THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE VERY DOORS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0024)
ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE FINISHED	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0025)
HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BIDE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0000)
WHAT CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0001)
OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLAN THE COFFINS FOR US	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0002)
AND SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0003)
BUT AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0004)
AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT A WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0005)
BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPT HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0006)
BUT THE HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0007)
EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN A FORMER PIECE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0008)
WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE WERE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0009)
HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETEL BROKE A LARGE PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0010)
COME IN AND WALK WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0011)
THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAYLAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREAD HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THAT DAY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0012)
THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH SHE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0013)
GRETEL BEGAN TO CRY AND IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0014)
GRETTEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0015)
DEAR GOOD GOD HELP ME NOW SHE PRAYED	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0016)
CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MAY EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0017)
SEEING I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0018)
AND SHE GOT UP PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0019)
AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE AT EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0020)
THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S HEAD	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0021)
NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SIDNEY'S INTEREST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT THIS CLUB	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0000)
THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THE CRUISE WAS OVER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0001)
THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS WERE CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANDAL	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0002)
RANDAL WAITED THE WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENNYDECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0003)
HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SIDINUM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0004)
HAD YOUR BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0005)
RANDAL AROSE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0006)
AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATIONS HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0007)
YOU DISTRESS ME GILBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0008)
AND HE DRANK THE WINE GREEDILY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0009)
WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MATTER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0010)
HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASSES TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0011)
RANDEL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SYDNEY IS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0012)
I CAN DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0013)
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT HER ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0014)
I' AM ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0015)
I HAVENT COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0016)
BUT WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0017)
I' M AFRAID HE SAID	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0018)
I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT I TOOK JUST NOW	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0019)
HE PAUSED THEN PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0020)
WAS HIS MIND FALLING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0021)
I CAN'T DO IT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0022)
LET ME HEAR WHAT HE IS FIRST	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0023)

SHE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAK UP OF THE FAMILY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0027)
ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR CIDENHAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0000)
A NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDAL BOUGHT IT	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0001)
AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0002)
RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THIS PARAGRAPH	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0003)
WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW COULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0004)
MISSUS NORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT RIDING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0005)
MISSUS PRESTY WAS AT HOME AND SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0006)
HOW NICE OF YOU TO SAY SO SOON SHE BEGAN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0007)
SHE UTTERED LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0008)
BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SOONHAM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0009)
YOUR REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FRIEND	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0010)
BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITING TO FIND OUT WHETHER REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVOURITE NEWSPAPERS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0011)
YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT KATHINE IS A WIDOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0012)
SIT DOWN SAID MISSUS PRESBY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0013)
YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSEAR AFTER YOU LEFT US	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0014)
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERCY ON HER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0015)
HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISTER NORMAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0016)
WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MAY BE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0017)
AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONSIDERED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KITTY THAT MISSUS NORMAN WAS A WIDOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0018)
WORST STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU MOST STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0019)
BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH YOUR MOTHER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0020)
AND HONESTLY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0021)
AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0022)
SHE ASKED QUIETLY IF HER FATHER WAS DEAD	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0023)
THAT WILL DO MISTER PRESTY YOUR DEFENSE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0024)
RANDAL PASSED THIS OVER WITHOUT NOTICED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0025)
A VERY WISE DECISION SHE DEMANDED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0026)
HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR COUSIN BENNYDECK	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0027)
NOT AT MY HOTEL JUST NOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0028)
IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S RELATIONS TOWARDS BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0029)
GOOD BYE DEAREST RANDAL	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0030)
ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDAL FOUND THAT HE MIGHT WAIT FOR THE TRAIN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0031)
WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND AN ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0032)
WHAT IS YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0000)
YOU HAVE BEEN TO A HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERINE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0001)
WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU'VE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0002)
NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE IDIOT CAN SUPPLY	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0003)
SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAVE BEEN TRUE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0004)
IN THE MEAN TIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INFLUENCE RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0005)
HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING KATE TO GRANT SIDNEY AN INTERVIEW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0006)
EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SITDENHAM	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0007)
BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN BEFORE HIM NOW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0008)
CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKING THE LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0009)
WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS BROTHER'S WIFE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0010)
WILL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0011)
HE ASKED SIDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0012)
BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR KATE'S REPLY	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0013)
GO AND DO YOU HEAR	(84-121123-84-121123-0000)
BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE TERRACE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT	(84-121123-84-121123-0001)
AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTERED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE HIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY	(84-121123-84-121123-0002)
AND THIS CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE	(84-121123-84-121123-0003)
DAVERNIE RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0004)
DAVERNIY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN	(84-121123-84-121123-0005)
FOR SOMETIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND PRAYERS	(84-121123-84-121123-0006)
WHAT DOES YOU MEAN SIR	(84-121123-84-121123-0007)
AH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0008)
DO YOU KNOW THAT ASSASSIN ASKED MORREL	(84-121123-84-121123-0009)
NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTIONS	(84-121123-84-121123-0010)
SAID MORREL SADLY YET REPLIED NOIRTIER	(84-121123-84-121123-0011)
THE OLD MAN'S EYES BECAME FIXED ON THE DOOR	(84-121123-84-121123-0012)
ASKED MORREL AGAIN	(84-121123-84-121123-0013)
MUST I BE ALONE NO	(84-121123-84-121123-0014)
BUT CANNOT HE UNDERSTAND YOU YES	(84-121123-84-121123-0015)
GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A HARSH VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOUR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOREVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK	(84-121123-84-121123-0016)
MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THIS SECRET DID YOU NOT FATHER	(84-121123-84-121123-0017)
MORREL SOUGHT AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM	(84-121123-84-121123-0018)
THE OLD WOMAN MADE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0019)
IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY AND MUTE DESPAIR OF MOIRTIER WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS	(84-121123-84-121123-0020)
BUT HE STOPPED ON THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT A DEATH CHAMBER	(84-121123-84-121123-0021)
THE TWO DOCTORS THEREFORE ENTERED THAT ROOM ALONE	(84-121123-84-121123-0022)
NOIRTIER WERE NEAR THE BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE	(84-121123-84-121123-0023)
