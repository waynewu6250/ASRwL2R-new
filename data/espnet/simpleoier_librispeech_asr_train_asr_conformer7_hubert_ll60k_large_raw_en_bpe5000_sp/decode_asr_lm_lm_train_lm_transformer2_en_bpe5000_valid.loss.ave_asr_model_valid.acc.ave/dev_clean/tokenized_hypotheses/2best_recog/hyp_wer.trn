PREFACE TO THIS SECOND EDITION	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0000)
THAT IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0001)
ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISES TO THE PRINTER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0002)
I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0003)
I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS OF MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0004)
I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0005)
BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFELONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT IT DID NOT MATTER	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0006)
I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAD TREATED MY ADVENTURES	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0007)

I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TROUBENNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0010)
I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVORABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0011)

I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF IRWHON THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD	(2412-153947-2412-153947-0015)

IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THIS NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0000)

I WOULD TRY THE NEARER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I CAN GO	(2412-153948-2412-153948-0015)
SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MISTS AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0000)

EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYE LASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0005)
THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION IN FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0006)
EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMELY AND THE OLD GRAY HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0007)

THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0010)
I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUARDS AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0011)

I SAW THE FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAILS	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0013)
IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER	(2412-153954-2412-153954-0014)

IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLINGS	(2428-83705-2428-83705-0001)
I DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARIANNE'S THINGS HAVE BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED	(2428-83705-2428-83705-0002)

FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHO IS IN THAT LINE	(2428-83705-2428-83705-0010)
I NEVER SAW A PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINES	(2428-83705-2428-83705-0011)

I NOTICED THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS	(2428-83705-2428-83705-0029)

MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATIONS ON THE PAMPAS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS	(2803-154320-2803-154320-0004)

BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE OF DUNCAN GOD FORBID	(2803-154320-2803-154320-0014)
THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WASHITI RANGES WERE LIT FOR THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0000)
THEY HAD NO NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0001)
A MEAL ENDED	(2803-154328-2803-154328-0002)

FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THE HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES	(2803-161169-2803-161169-0009)
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL	(2803-161169-2803-161169-0010)

ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN ERA LABOURS UNDER A TROUBLESOME DISADVANTAGE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0000)
IN THE PRESENT CASE THE DISADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR WHILE THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HEINOUS WERE STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THE SINS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH SHE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY TO STATE THE CHURCH'S CASE FAR MORE WEAKLY THAN THE FACTS DESERVE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0001)
NOT BE IT REMEMBERED THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF IMMORALITY ATTACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSOPHERS OF HER SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0002)

JULIAN'S LAST ATTEMPT TO RESTORE PAGANISM BY IMPERIAL INFLUENCE HAD ONLY PROVED THAT THE OLD FAITH HAD LOST ALL HOLD UPON THE HEARTS OF THE MASSES AT HIS DEATH THE GREAT TIDE WAVE OF NEW OPINION ROLLED ON UNCHECKED AND THE RULERS OF EARTH WERE FAIN TO SWIM WITH THE STREAM TO ACCEPT IN WORDS AT LEAST THE CHURCHES LAWS AS THEIRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A KING OF KINGS TO WHOM EVEN THEY OWED HOMAGE AND OBEDIENCE AND TO CALL THEIR OWN SLAVES THEIR POORER BRETHREN AND OFTEN TOO THEIR SPIRITUAL SUPERIORS	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0005)
BUT IF THE EMPEROR HAD BECOME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAD NOT	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0006)
IN THE MEANWHILE THE MINDS OF MEN CUT ADRIFT FROM THEIR ANCIENT MOORINGS WANDER WILDLY OVER PATHLESS SEAS OF SPECULATIVE DOUBT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE METAPHYSICAL AND CONTEMPLATIVE EAST ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE FOR THEMSELVES THE QUESTIONS OF MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNSEEN BY THOSE THOUSAND SCHISMS HERESIES AND THEOSOPHIES IT IS A DISGRACE TO THE WORD PHILOSOPHY TO CALL THEM BY IT ON THE RECORDS OF WHICH THE STUDENT NOW GAZES BEWILDERED UNABLE ALIKE TO COUNT OR TO EXPLAIN THEIR FANTASIES	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0007)
THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCHMEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE SOLVED UNLESS THE CHURCH WAS TO RELINQUISH FOR EVER HER CLAIMS AS THE GREAT TEACHER AND SATISFIER OF THE HUMAN SOUL	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0008)
BUT THE HEALTH OF THE CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE CREED WHICH IT PROFESSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF A FEW GREAT ECCLESIASTICS BUT ON THE FAITH AND VIRTUE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0009)

TRIBE AFTER TRIBE WAS CROWDING DOWN INTO THE ALPS AND TRAMPLING UPON EACH OTHER ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0012)
THE HUNS SINGLY THEIR INFERIORS PRESSED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS ITALY WITH HER RICH CITIES AND FERTILE LOWLANDS BECKONED THEM ON TO PLUNDER AS AUXILIARIES THEY HAD LEARNED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND ROMAN WEAKNESS A CASUS BELLI WAS SOON FOUND	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0013)
HOW INIQUITOUS WAS THE CONDUCT OF THE SONS OF THEODOSIUS IN REFUSING THE USUAL BOUNTY BY WHICH THE GOTHS WERE BRIBED NOT TO ATTACK THE EMPIRE THE WHOLE PENT UP DELUGE BURST OVER THE PLAINS OF ITALY AND THE WESTERN EMPIRE BECAME FROM THAT DAY FORTH A DYING ITALY WHILE THE NEW INVADERS DIVIDED EUROPE AMONG THEMSELVES	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0014)
THE COUNTLESS TREASURES WHICH FIVE CENTURIES OF RAPINE HAD ACCUMULATED AROUND THE CAPITAL HAD BECOME THE PREY OF MEN CLOTHED IN SHEEPSKINS AND HORSEHIDE AND THE SISTER OF AN EMPEROR HAD FOUND HER BEAUTY VIRTUE AND PRIDE OF RACE WORTHILY MATCHED BY THOSE OF THE HARD HANDED NORTHERN HERO WHO LED HER AWAY FROM ITALY AS HIS CAPTIVES AND HIS BRIDE TO FOUND NEW KINGDOMS IN SOUTH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND TO DRIVE THE NEWLY ARRIVED VANDALS ACROSS THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR INTO THE THEN BLOOMING COASTLAND OF NORTHERN AFRICA	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0015)

CLIMATE BAD EXAMPLE AND THE LUXURY OF POWER DEGRADED THEM IN ONE CENTURY INTO A RACE OF HELPLESS AND DEBAUCHED SLAVE HOLDERS DOOMED TO UTTER EXTERMINATION BEFORE THE SEMI GOTHIC ARMIES OF BELISARIUS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE LAST CHANCE THAT THE GOTHIC RACES WOULD EXERCISE ON THE EASTERN WORLD THE SAME STERN YET WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH THE WESTERN HAD BEEN RESTORED TO LIFE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0017)
THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSIC SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN UNMEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT THAT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOMO IOSEUS AND HOMO IOSIUS MIGHT HANG THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET TO BATTLE IN ALEXANDRIA THE ANCIENT STRONGHOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THE EFFICAT REMAINS OF THE VERY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED ITS EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0018)

I CAN NOT HOPE THAT THESE PAGES WILL BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM ANACHRONISMS AND ERRORS	(2902-9006-2902-9006-0020)

THE ROOM HAD NEITHER CARPET NOR FIREPLACE AND THE ONLY MOVABLES IN IT WERE A SOFA BED A TABLE AND AN ARM CHAIR ALL OF SUCH DELICATE AND GRACEFUL FORMS AS MAY BE SEEN ON ANCIENT VASES OF A FAR EARLIER PERIOD THAN THAT WHEREOF WE WRITE	(2902-9008-2902-9008-0001)
BUT MOST PROBABLY HAD ANY OF US ENTERED THAT ROOM THAT MORNING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPARE A LOOK EITHER FOR THE FURNITURE OR THE GENERAL EFFECT OR THE MUSEUM GARDENS OR THE SPARKLING MEDITERRANEAN BEYOND BUT WE SHOULD HAVE AGREED THAT THE ROOM WAS QUITE RICH ENOUGH FOR HUMAN EYES FOR THE SAKE OF ONE TREASURE WHICH IT POSSESSED AND BESIDES WHICH NOTHING WAS WORTH A MOMENT'S GLANCE	(2902-9008-2902-9008-0002)

BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOOD ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD THE EYE	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0028)
THEN FELL THE GLOAMING MAKING EVERY THING STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0029)
THAN DARKNESS LIKE DEATH	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0030)

THEY ARE BROAD RUGGED CREVASSED CLOUD LIKE MASSES OF BROWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING IN SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVERLIKE GO WINDING DOWN THE VALLEYS THROUGH THE FORESTS TO THE SEA	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0033)

SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEMS SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PIT RIVER THEN YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT	(3000-15664-3000-15664-0035)

HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0009)
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0010)
THE BOYS LOOKED WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0011)
A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE DISCUSSING	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0012)
I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THE FURTIVE WATCHER	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0013)
I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0014)
I'M LOOKING AT HIM NOW	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0015)

I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE RETURNED TO MY SIDE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0019)
HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MIGHT SEND ME	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0020)
I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0021)
HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0022)

THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL IN	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0024)
I WISHED WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0025)
HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETINGS IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0026)
A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0027)
IT WAS ONE THAT GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0028)
THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0029)
THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES OF THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0030)
THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARD HIM	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0031)
IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0032)
FOR CLUES THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0033)
THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0034)
AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I HOPE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0035)
IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND BRYCE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0036)
THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED INTO THE FLOOR	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0037)
SHE HAD NO COMPANIONS NEAR HER	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0038)
NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AN SUDDEN FALL	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0039)
IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0040)
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT BRYCE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0041)
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DUSK YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0042)
THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0043)
HE WAS THAT PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0044)
THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGEE'S AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0045)
BENT OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0046)

OLD DAYS DON'T TURN FOR THE ASKING	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0050)
WHETHER HE GOT ANY THING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0051)
ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE ENDS OF THE HALL	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0052)
NATURALLY THEY REACHED THE FIRST	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0053)

HONEST GERMANS WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0055)
WHO CAME NEXT UPON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LOBBY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0056)
ANYTHING BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0057)
YES MISSUS CLARK THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARISHES	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0058)
I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED I SHOULD SAY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0059)
AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WOMAN	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0060)
NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME THE DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0061)

WHEREVER SHE PLEASES I CAN'T WALK FAR	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0066)
IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT AND IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0067)
THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0068)
VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WOULD	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0069)

AS THE QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0071)
THERE IS NO DOUBTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0072)
	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0073)
FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVED IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0074)
OH YES MANY TIMES	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0075)
WHAT MADE A DIFFERENCE	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0076)
MISS CLARK STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DO I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0077)
A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0078)
AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYES SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0079)
I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0080)
THERE WAS NO POIGNARD IN THE WOUND	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0081)
THE TIME WAS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARK WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0082)
I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FARTHER	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0083)
SWEET WATER HELP ME OUT OF THIS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0084)
BUT VIGOUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARK AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0085)
THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THE LADY'S ARMS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0086)
NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZZONINE WHAT FOLLOWS	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0087)
SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THAT STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0088)
IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR ROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND	(3081-166546-3081-166546-0089)
WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE INSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0000)
I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0001)
I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CAN NOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0002)
BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THAT VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0003)
OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREAT DANGER	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0004)
WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RUMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKES	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0005)
WE DID THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESS TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCELLENT HEALTH	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0006)
WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO THE CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0007)
THIS WAS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0008)
IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAGASINO	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0009)
YET THERE ARE FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0010)
THE WAITER OF THE MAGASINO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0011)
WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS INTO A LARGE BOAT	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0012)
WHERE WAS MY HUSBAND	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0013)
NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TOMORROW	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0014)
MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BADE US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0015)
TWO DAYS AFTERWARD OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0016)
AND WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0017)
THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRADER AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0018)
I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STAIRS I HANDED IT TO HIM	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0019)
I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED ON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0020)
I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT A NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0021)
I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RITTA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I INQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0022)
TAKING EVERY THING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A PHYSICIAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLED AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0023)
THINKING I HAD A RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0024)
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILE I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0025)
HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE TRIED TO POISON HIM	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0026)
THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING THE MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0027)
DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT HE LAY DOWN AGAIN	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0028)
HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL THEM THE TRUTH	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0029)

THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I SHOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULUS	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0037)
NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANYONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0038)

BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT	(3170-137482-3170-137482-0040)

EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0001)
YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISSUS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0002)

AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DORRIFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYES GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0017)
MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE JINGLE OF A TEA SPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0018)
MISSUS HORTON TOO IN THIS SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0019)

IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF THE FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0025)
FORGET THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0026)
WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPRESSED	(3536-23268-3536-23268-0027)

IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0003)
MISSUS BASIL WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0004)
AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0005)

HE CAN'T SUCKLE EM KENNY	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0009)

DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BASIL LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELLION	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0016)
THEN BASIL CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0017)
BUT TRAVELLION WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0018)
BASIL HAD ALWAYS WAITED ON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0019)
IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BASLE TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0020)
PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TREVILIAN	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0021)
MISSUS BASLE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0022)

IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKINNT SIR SUGGESTED BASIL	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0025)

I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS CAN GO PRETTY NEAR	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0029)
BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY OF COURSE THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0030)
AND BASIL AS HE SAID THIS SIGHED ALMOST ALOUD	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0031)
AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BASLE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK	(3536-8226-3536-8226-0032)

HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND MADE FOR ANOTHER TREE WHEN THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE FELL A SHOUTING CALLING UPON DON QUIXOTE TO COME AND PROTECT HIM	(3576-138058-3576-138058-0011)
DON QUIXOTE DID SO AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHAT HE WAS AFRAID OF	(3576-138058-3576-138058-0012)
SANCHO REPLIED THAT ALL THE TREES WERE FULL OF MENS FEET AND LEGS	(3576-138058-3576-138058-0013)

SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BERTAKINS	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0000)
INDEED IT WAS NOT A NEST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0001)

O WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0003)
AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS HAPPY	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0004)
SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER GIRL	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0005)
SHE POPPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0006)
THEN SHE SAW ALL THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0007)
THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRRUPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASK HER TO TEACH US	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0008)

AND WHEN EACH BIRD PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0012)
SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS OF THINGS INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0013)
AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ACTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0014)
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A WAY TO BEGIN	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0015)

MUCH LUCK WILL YOU HAVE	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0020)

BUT THE WOODPIGEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF ALL	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0022)
FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATIONS LAID CRISS CROSS AS THE MAGPIE HAD SHOWN HER	(7850-281318-7850-281318-0023)

IS DISGRACEFUL	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0001)
THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM A BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0002)
THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0003)
YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS ON EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0004)
THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT IN THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0005)
BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LARVA	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0006)
WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANY WAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0007)
OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0008)

INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARMLIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0010)
BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN HIS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0011)
SCARED EH WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0012)
HERE COMES THE SNAPPY TURTLE	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0013)
SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BLACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0014)
THEY THOUGHT HE MUST BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0015)
HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL	(7850-286674-7850-286674-0016)

FERDINAND MEDITATES OVER THIS GOOD FORTUNE	(7850-73752-7850-73752-0000)
IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING A LIKE SUDDEN BURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE	(7850-73752-7850-73752-0001)
IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER AND DISGRACE	(7850-73752-7850-73752-0002)
THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY OUR FRIEND FERDINAND ARMINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUS MIRABELLE WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND INTO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVERCOMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES	(7850-73752-7850-73752-0003)

THE MOST GIFTED INDIVIDUALS OF THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN PROVING WHICH ENTERTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION	(7850-73752-7850-73752-0009)
HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLESSINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM WERE THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA	(7850-73752-7850-73752-0010)

WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRACTION UPON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER	(7850-73752-7850-73752-0015)

HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BAKER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0010)
IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDER SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0011)
WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE MAJOR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0012)
THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THE NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0013)
SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT A SLEEPING POWDER HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0014)
SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0015)
IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED A ROBBER CHIEFTAIN	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0016)
PERHAPS WE CAN OUTWIT HER YET SAID ANOTHER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0017)
THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS HE WANTED	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0018)
I PROMISE YOU I WOULD DO YOU NO HARM	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0019)
YOU SHALL NOT COME INTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0020)
PASS THE CHARM OUT TO ME SAID THE ROBBER	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0021)
WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH A HOLE IN THE DOOR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0022)
THE CRIES AND CURSES OF THE LOVERS FILLED THE AIR	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0023)
THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE DOORS	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0024)
ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU ARE FOOLISH	(7976-110124-7976-110124-0025)
HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0000)
HOW COULD WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0001)
O YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLAN THE COFFINS FOR US	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0002)
BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0003)
AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0004)
AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0005)
BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET ON THE PATH	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0006)
BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0007)
EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0008)
WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE'RE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0009)
HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOM TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0010)
COME IN AND TALK WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0011)
THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAYLAID CHILDREN AND BUILT A BREAD HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED THEM AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0012)
THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICED DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0013)
GRETTEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0014)
GRETTEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANDSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0015)
DEAR GOD HELP US NOW SHE PRAYED	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0016)
CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETTEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0017)
SEE I CAN EVEN GET IN MYSELF	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0018)
SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0019)
AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WAS CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0020)
THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK	(7976-110523-7976-110523-0021)
NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SYDNEY'S INTEREST TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0000)
THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO THE PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0001)
THIS ALTERNATIVE AND THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANDAL	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0002)
RANDAL WAITED A WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENNYDECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0003)
HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SEIDONUM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0004)
HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0005)
RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION KATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0006)
AFTER MONTH OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0007)
YOU DISTRESS ME MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0008)
HE DRANK WINE GREEDILY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0009)
WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED UPON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0010)
HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTIONS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0011)
RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SIDNEY IS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0012)
I DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0013)
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THAT ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0014)
I AM ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0015)
I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT MYSELF	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0016)
O WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0017)
I AM AFRAID HE SAID	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0018)
I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I AM FEELING THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0019)
HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HANDS TO HIS FEVERED HEAD	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0020)
WAS HIS MIND WANDERING TO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0021)
YOU CAN'T DO THAT	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0022)
LET ME HEAR WHAT IS FIRST	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0023)
I FEAR FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WARMLY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0024)
SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL I CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0025)
LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I AM NOT IN THE WAY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0026)
HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAKING UP OF THE FAMILY	(8297-275154-8297-275154-0027)
ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SYDENHAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0000)
THE NEW NUMBER OF THE POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDAL BOUGHT IT	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0001)
AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED IN THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0002)
RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORD IN THE PARAGRAPH	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0003)
WITH HIS OWN SUSPICION STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0004)
MISSUS THORNTON AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0005)
MISSUS PRESTY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF A HOTEL	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0006)
HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE SAID	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0007)
SHE ASKED LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0008)
BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SOYDENHAM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0009)
THIS REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FRIEND	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0010)
BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVOURITE NEWSPAPERS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0011)
YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT KATHERINE IS A WIDOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0012)
SIT DOWN SAID MISS PRESTY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0013)
YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED FATHER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSEAL AFTER YOU LEFT US	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0014)
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE NO MERCY ON HER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0015)
HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS NORMAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND THEY WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0016)
WHEN HE AND I HAPPEN TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0017)
AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KATY THAT MISSUS NORMAN WAS A WIDOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0018)
WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0019)
BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE MOTHER	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0020)
MODESTLY	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0021)
AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KATY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0022)
SHE ASKED DIRECTLY HER FATHER WAS DEAD	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0023)
THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENSE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0024)
RANDAL PASSED THAT OVER WITHOUT NOTICE	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0025)
A VERY WISE DECISION SHE REPLIED	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0026)
HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BEDECK	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0027)
NOT AT THAT HOTEL JUST NOW	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0028)
IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARDS BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0029)
GOOD BY DEAR RANDAL	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0030)
ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDAL FOUND HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0031)
WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SIDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN	(8297-275155-8297-275155-0032)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE HE ASKED	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0000)
YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERINE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0001)
WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPERS OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0002)
NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY EDITOR CAN SUPPLY	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0003)
SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAS BEEN TRUE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0004)
IN THE MEAN TIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0005)
HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARDS PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SIDNEY AN INTERVIEW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0006)
EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SIDENHAM	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0007)
BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0008)
CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0009)
WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE WOULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0010)
SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TOMORROW	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0011)
HE ADDED SIDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0012)
BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHARINE'S REPLY	(8297-275156-8297-275156-0013)
GO YOU HEAR	(84-121123-84-121123-0000)
BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRS GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT	(84-121123-84-121123-0001)
AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTERED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY	(84-121123-84-121123-0002)
AND A CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE	(84-121123-84-121123-0003)
DAVERIGNY RUSHED TOWARD THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0004)
DAVERY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN	(84-121123-84-121123-0005)
FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THE CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND PRAYERS	(84-121123-84-121123-0006)
WHAT YOU MEAN SIR	(84-121123-84-121123-0007)
OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0008)
DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED MORRELL	(84-121123-84-121123-0009)
NOIRTIER LOOKED ON MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION	(84-121123-84-121123-0010)
SAID MORREL SADLY YES NOIRTIER	(84-121123-84-121123-0011)
THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED UPON THE DOOR	(84-121123-84-121123-0012)
ASKED MORREL	(84-121123-84-121123-0013)
MUST I LIVE ALONE NO	(84-121123-84-121123-0014)
BUT CAN HE UNDERSTAND YOU	(84-121123-84-121123-0015)
GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOUR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOREVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK	(84-121123-84-121123-0016)
MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THE SECRET DO YOU NOT FATHER	(84-121123-84-121123-0017)
MORRELL SUFFERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM	(84-121123-84-121123-0018)
THE MAN MADE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE	(84-121123-84-121123-0019)
IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF MOIRTIER WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS	(84-121123-84-121123-0020)
BUT HE STOOD ON THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER	(84-121123-84-121123-0021)
THE TWO DOCTORS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM	(84-121123-84-121123-0022)
NOIRTIER WAS NEAR THE BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS A CORPSE	(84-121123-84-121123-0023)
THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONG THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JUST UNCLOSED THE LIPS	(84-121123-84-121123-0024)
THE NEAREST SAID THE DOCTOR IS A GOOD ITALIAN ABBE WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU SHALL I CALL ON HIM AS I PASS	(84-121123-84-121123-0025)
D'AVERIGNY SAID VILLEFORT BE SO KIND I BESEECH YOU AS TO ACCOMPANY THIS GENTLEMAN HERE IS THE KEY OF THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND OUT AS YOU PLEASE YOU WILL BRING THE PRIEST WITH YOU AND WILL OBLIGE ME BY INTRODUCING HIM INTO MY CHILD'S ROOM DO YOU WISH TO SEE HIM	(84-121123-84-121123-0026)
I ONLY WISHED TO BE ALONE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME WILL YOU NOT	(84-121123-84-121123-0027)
I AM GOING SIR AND DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PRAYERS WILL BE MORE FERVENT THAN MINE	(84-121123-84-121123-0028)
BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURTHEN TO THEIR RHYMES	(84-121550-84-121550-0000)
ALL WATERS THAT ON THE EARTH MOST LIMPID ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL	(84-121550-84-121550-0001)
THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PROSERPINA THE MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING	(84-121550-84-121550-0002)
